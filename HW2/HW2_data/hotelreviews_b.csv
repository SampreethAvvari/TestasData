"1",5,"I stayed here for one night for business. I am a Marriott person myself, but was pleasantly surprised! I would compare it to a Marriott Courtyard! The room was very nice and clean and the staff was friendly. The hot breakfast included eggs, sausage, biscuits, hot cinnamon rolls, pancakes, bagels, toast, etc. and was wonderful! I would highly recommend it!"

"3",5,"...without the hassle of being downtown. Nestled in San Marco one block from Hendricks Ave., this cozy little hideaway is well worth looking for. The hotel is just far enough away from the traffic, yet so close to everything if you're willing to be creative. For instance, if you want to head to downtown Jacksonville and the Northbank Riverwalk, you... More"
"4",3,"I have told the Westin I am going to leave honest feedback on my experience and will do so. First, the hotel is beautiful. Guests commented on the amazing and historic beauty it had to offer. Rooms are a bit pricey, but comparable to other hotels in downtown Greenville. In fact,... Read More rooms in the room block here were cheaper than what other hotels were going to offer in blocks. The complimentary night for the wedding was an added plus. We had our reception in the Gold Ballroom and that, too, was a great location site. It was stunning and if you want a reception in a ballroom, I wouldn't have anything negative to say about it. I caution you if you plan on solely relying on the hotel's event planner. While she sets up everything for you (or instructs the staff, I'm not entirely sure), I still had a day of coordinator and do not regret that choice one bit. My DOC had to fix the centerpieces since they did not match the pictures provided. Also, my DOC was present through the ENTIRE reception. The hotel's planner typically does not stay until the end of the reception and also was not there Sunday during our departure to help us locate some of our items. The hotel's planner is not consistently present during the reception, especially if there is another wedding or event in the hotel. She is present only here and there, but not consistently. We had an issue with our champagne toast and had to send my DOC to try to locate the hotel's planner or anyone to help. Overall, the hotel's planner was useful in organizing the details, planning food, etc. She ensured the timeline generally flowed and we got to where we needed to be. At times, communication was hard and responses to questions were delayed. The overall package price, in my opinion, was helpful. Next, we had issues with the clean up of the event, which is part of the package. The staff told my DOC they were not going to pack up the reception decor, which resulted in my DOC, father, and several groomsmen spending an hour or two packing up the items and then carrying them to my father's room. As the hotel planner was not there at the end of the reception, there was no one to talk to about what was happening. Needless to say, the end result was a DOC I needed to compensate for time outside our contract and a not very pleased Father of the Bride. After some pressing to the Westin, compensation was given for this. I can at least give them credit for rectifying a wrong though it did take some pushing. For reception food, it was fantastic. We had many compliments on the steak, sides, etc. The staff was attentive and the bar service was quick. My father had lots of positive things to say about the staff and especially liked Eric. Eric is a jack of all trades - he was the bartender at the rehearsal, bell hop at various points, waiter at the reception, van driver on Sunday. If you have Eric doing anything, you are in good hands. We also had a fantastic server, JJ, at the wedding - we loved her, too. The Westin suggested doing wine passing during dinner and closing the bar as a cost saver. In the end, this was more expensive than simply doing another hour for the open bar. You are charged taxes, gratuity, and services fees for this hour though the contract states this is part of the package; this was an issue and I'm still not in agreement that it was right since it was never mentioned. Think twice about this option. Most of our decor was returned - a few items were missing."

"8",5,"This motel is in an excellent location at a reasonable price for the area. The room was very clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. It is about a five minute drive from the downtown area. If you are a Best Western Rewards member, the room charge includes a breakfast at Denny's, which is located on the same property. It is not the regular breakfast menu however, it has a variety of selections and we were happy with the amount of food provided.cinann - Thank you for taking the time to write this review. Our entire staff takes pride in our hotel and it shows inside and out. Our prices are very reasonable for the Napa Valley. Being just a few minutes from Downtown Napa and wineries in the area, you just can't beat that. Thank you for being a Best Western Rewards Member and we hope you visit us again soon.

Ill be sure to share your feedback with our staff. Thanks for staying, we hope to see you in the future, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"16",3,"Overall our stay was decent. However, I would've rated it higher if the indoor pool was clean and usable. It was GREEN and smelled unkept which was disappointing with 2 children. In addition, the bathroom could've been cleaner. The toilet bowl was cleaned and the shower curtain was moldy. On a positive note, the staff was EXTREMELY friendly and the complimentary breakfast was quite yummy"

"21",4,"We stayed here in the heat of summer with our dog. While there isn't a huge dog area outside, walking down the business park street behind the hotel provided enough space for our dog to unwind from a long car ride. On leash. Breakfast was standard, hard boiled eggs, waffles, yogurt, cereal, etc.. good coffee. The staff was just awesome in the friendly department. And 2 steak houses are within 3 miles, and super cheap gas at Circle K is close as well."

"26",1,"We were looking for a place to stay outside of Boston and all the motels in this area seemed to be full. We found this one, overpriced, but thought we had no choice. We positively hated it and moved to the all-new Motel 6 for the rest of our stay. It was cheaper, much newer and cleaner."
"27",4,"firstly try to park at the front (not the side) of the hotel if you can or in the garage which has direct access to the casinothe smoke from the casino floor doesn't tend to filter into the lifts and upper floors unlike in some of the downtown casinosthe rooms are very large and well appointed. those facing west have a great view of the las vegas stripwe got an early check in at noon which was good and the process was handled in a friendly but efficient way. ac in room was very efficient and the rooms were quiet when we were therelots of eating choices in the casino and surrounding area but you do need a car in order to take advantage of this as the distances and temperatures make walking a difficult optionhowever the local bus does appear to go to the airport on a regular basis and the casino also offered a shuttle there as wellrecommended"
"28",5,"We went to the room and it was so nice I went to the desk and reserved the room for an extra day. we were going to leave Saturday but we added that extra night. We left Sunday wishing we could stay longer."

"33",5,"The breakfast had a little to be desired. And we weren't told when it ended, so when we showed up there was very little, if anything left. But the staff and facilities were very nice and clean. I would probably stay there again"
"34",5,"I almost always stay at Best Western properties. I like supporting independent owners. This hotel was everything you could want in an overnight stay. Clean, comfortable and quiet. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
"35",5,"We truly enjoyed our stay. The room was great and we definitely appreciated the hotel shuttle service to near by attractions and resturants. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
"36",5,"We had a problem with our air conditioning in the air and they were unable to fix it so they moved us to a new room even though the hotel was completely booked. It was a great place to stay overnight and very close to the auto train. Great staff!"
"37",4,"One of the girls at check-in had zero personality. actually she was draining. Outside my view room was the obstruction of a white wood gazebo. I don't understand this to be a view. The room service selection price and quality was excellent!"
"38",5,"Couldn't be nicer!!! Front desk was courtesy at check in. Clean rooms no bed so comfortable. Front desk called 10 mins after check in to make sure everything was ok. Fresh and nice breakfast selection."
"39",3,"part of the hotel look great and updated, but the room needed a major renovation. carpet was dirty and wrinkled (could trip on it), and the bathroom was dingy: white enamel broken off on bathtub, toilet paper holder coming off the wall, dirty shower curtain, etc. but the bed was relatively comfy and the hotel quiet when we stayed there. complimentary shuttle to metro station was very convenient. staff was not very friendly and we could not order anything at the bar because there wasn't anyone there (bartender at some point was eating nearby in the lobby but did not acknowledge us and at other times the bar was empty)."

"41",4,"Rooms spacious, including bathroom. Clean and functioning well. Attentive staff. Very dated decor throughout - distracting, but little impact on our experience there. Requested 2 queen as listed on Hotels.com, but hotel offers 2 DOUBLE beds, which is a significant drawback for our family. Free ear plugs because closing doors are LOUD. That might have been the only downside. Pool and hottub were great. Ample supply of towels with extended access hours as compared to some places we've stayed. Breakfast was good, but crowded. Layout is a challenge when busy as several key items are in corners or nooks. No place to line up but through the dining tables, pathway, etc. Would stay here again if the price were right. Otherwise, would be a more modern competitor with queen beds."
"42",5,"I found this hotel to be clean, fresh in appearance, and comfortable. I would recommend this hotel. It was good to have a restaurant on-site and we found the food to be quite good. No complaints. Thank you for the stay."

We were traveling with our 2 dogs - we were a little taken back by the non-refundable pet fee of 75 for nights 1-7, we were only staying one night and thought this was a little steep. However, after checking in and seeing the cleanliness of our room, being a pet friendly room you expect to find at least one sign another dog had been there - Nope! Immaculate! Great cleaning staff!

"59",3,"Not sure who to blame. Expedia, says something about surcharge in one place, another place says nothing. Real pain to realize you got a good room rate, then need to fork out an extra 50 for parking. Of course no one takes responsibility. To their credit, the front desk did offer 35, since it was 5 days. 50 is up to 14 days. Expedia couldn't do anything."

This hotel did pay attention to our special requests, which rarely happens and sometimes those little things make a BIG difference. We didn't try the breakfast but we will next time we stay here."
"66",1,"Worst hotel experience I have ever had. While waiting to check in, I overheard the 2 gentleman in front of me, basically planning their party in the room they were getting and the reception told them where the liquor store was. The reception clerk was nice, and checked us in quickly. That was the best thing about this experience. My wife and I walked into the room and we're immediately hit with a terrible smell, and before we could complain the phone rang in the room, which was the reception desk calling to tell us that she should not have put us in that room because of the smell, and to come to the desk for new keys to a different room, which we obliged. We got our new keys and went to the new room, which smelled better, but looked sketchy, so we pulled back the covers on the bed to see ants crawling around. This was the moment we decided to check out and went right across the street to the Hampton Inn, which was great and highly recommended. We never stayed at this hotel and never will. All I needed was a clean bed to stay in for a few hours so I could catch a flight, but this hotel couldn't even provide that. In fact this hotel just seemed like a party spot for locals and would not feel comfortable even parking my car in the parking lot. It's really a shame that this hotel is like this. It's in a great location and could be nice. Shame on me, as I did not heed the warning signs from the other reviews. Thought it would be okay for a few hours sleep. I was wrong"

"85",4,"This is a nice property, just by the lake union. The folks at the front desk were warm, friendly and helpful. I really liked this gentleman who would even strain his neck if there are lots of people at the reception and and peek out to say welcome back! when I return from office! Ha!There are a lots of eateries by the lake, so that's a win too.Some improvement opportunities - this is the only hotel where I found the housekeeping would just keep the bed and bath but wouldn't clear out used glasses, plates, soda cans etc. Those stuff were there on the table even after housekeeping was done.It would be great to have some variety in their room service. Especially if it rains, people opt to stay in have some food and I found the bistro options very limited.Also, the bistro staff were either very nice or made a bad impression - for instance, this one lady with a curly bobbed hair appeared very rude and made me feel like I am serving her when she came to deliver my food and in another instance, this one man appeared oh so friendly, almost too friendly and the moment I signed the receipt he was looking for the tip amount - making the whole thing feel like a forced show to get tip rather than genuine hospitality.But yea, the property is great and everything is at walkable or short driving distance. Overall 4 star experience."

Good: Great neighborhood on Boylston and a block from Newbury St. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance to choose from. It is one of the better values compared to other hotels in Boston. Half a block from the Copley T station if you want to get to another part of the city. 15- 20 minute walk to Fenway Park for the Sox game."

"95",2,"Pillows are uncomfortable Spotted babies cockroaches in kitten. No utensils. So prepare to bring things you need."
"96",2,"The room smelled of old smoke and room freshener!!! Bare essentials for the stay... remote setting from the main building with parking unavailable nearby. Scary and totally disappointing!"
"97",5,"We stayed here wilt our grandson and his Dalmatian dog and we had a terrific stay! Julia was joking with our grandson about how big the dog was and he thought that was great, everyday when we got back to the hotel he was looking for her to talk to about what he and the dog did, and by the end of our stay he was hugging her goodbye. Housekeeping was also terrific, never ran out of anything. Keep up the good worklwill789,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

"99",1,"I hate to give a bad review but this was such a bad experience i would hate for anyone to go through what i did. I booked a room for me and my other half for valentines day, got us a kingsize bed with a water view, got to check in at around 5 but told they over booked and no longer had my room available, keep in mind i booked my room a month ago... i was givin a room with two queen size beds that felt like a full Bad start to my romantic plans, after getting to our room we decided to go eat at the hotel restaurant fuego where we were greeted with a rude host that said since we had no reservation we had to sit inside, we said that fine yoy can see the water from anywhere inside it seemed, then she says its 95 per person but didnt tell us why just handed us the menu and said its the valentine menu. Already irritated from check in, now this chick, we changed our minds and said we can order room service... got some food that took an hour to arrive and it was not the best for 100, 3 tacos a quesadilla 2 salds and 2 cokes. We then decided to go for a walk that was nice with beautiful views, we started feeling good after some wine and craved a cigar... know there is no stores close by you have to go back accross the bridge in your car to get anything like that. Overall bad"

"101",4,"The Days Inn Portage was just what I needed for a very quick overnight stay in the area before an event. The room was comfortable and I thought the rate was very reasonable for the area. The pool looked nice and I was sorry I didn't bring a swimsuit even though I didn't have time! The front desk was very... More"
"102",2,"The hotel was nice but a bit old. The air conditioning did not work well in either of the rooms in which we stayed. In the evening we were told breakfast was available in the hotel. In the morning we were told our rooms did not include breakfast and it appeared that only high end rooms quailfied for breakfast. So we had to leave the hotel to eat. Over all I was dissatisfied and would not stay at this hotel again."
"103",5,"Beautiful property and every staff member I encountered (front desk, housekeeping, breakfast hosts and GM) provided beyond excellent customer service! It's also conveniently located near restaurants, grocery stores starbucks and is a short drive to the freeways. I will definitely be back!"

"105",4,"Bad: Room is on the small side. I was on one of the back rooms. There are no views and other buildings can see inside your room since windows are high. Breakfast is not attended and no hot option. Very narrow corridors. Good: The decor of the room is very modern and pleasing with sound equipment for those that want to listen to music with speakers on the wall. Floor of shower is non-slippery. Decor of the bathroom is also very nice. Location is outstanding with Copley subway station accross the street as well as bus stop. Restuarants and shops in Newbury Street one block away. Bagels and donuts in breakfast were fresh."
"106",5,"All employees were super friendly and accommodating, the rooms are clean, and overall an excellent experience! Would recommend highly. Good value as well. One of the nicer hotels in Anderson. Close to the casino.Thank you so much for your lovely feedback, hope to see you soon."

"110",5,"Bad: The TV was on in the lounge during breakfast, tuned to GMA and Kelly Ripa-terrible shows, too loud, couldn't find a remote. It would be better on close caption with no sound or another channel, or have the remote so that breakfasters can change it. Thanks!. Good: Atmosphere. Location."
"111",4,"We were for a week with our eleven month baby and it was a nice experience. The room was spacious and the baby had space for play and walk. The pool was clean and safe. The hotel people were very friendly, outstanding of all our needs."
"112",2,"Staff was friendly and informative... However... Room was a little dirty. Curtains were severly stained and carpet was filthy. Walked around with socks and within a few steps to the bathroom socks were black. Smelled humid and hallway was dirty."

It doesn't appear that they care about the upkeep of the hotel and as a non-smoker, I wasn't impressed with the smoke everywhere! I DID receive the non-smoking room I reserved...Too bad it wasn't smoke-free...because the room REEKED!!"
"130",5,"Efficient, friendly staff helps make every aspect -- check in, stay, check out -- easy and pleasant. On a long trip that really hits the spot. The room and amenities range from very good to excellent for this type of property."
"131",5,"The room, the beds, the food and the help at this hotel is nothing short of perfect without including a lot of extras my husband and I don't need. The location is close to everything and the building is historical and very well kept. Could not ask for a more homey place to stay."
"132",5,"Stayed for 4 days here. The Amenities are awesome. The staff were friendly. The only thing negative during my stay was that I lost money from gambling. The beer was expensive here. Otherwise the whole experience was exceptional."
"133",4,"quiet room, quick check-in, easy parking,hotel staff cordial/ helpful, breakfast exceptional- lots to chose from"
"134",5,"A return visitor. Very nice room, found it to be clean, very comfortable bed, and a good shower. The staff were extremely helpful and polite. Breakfast was real nice with good variety which made for a good start to the day. Recommend this hotel when in Fresno."
"135",5,"went for a nature getaway. I am disabled and really loved the spacious room that I could get my mobility scooter around in. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They even wash the blankets and covers for each new guest!!And I didn't hear any noise coming from other rooms."

The hotel was easy to find, and had an onsite parking garage (a little pricey, but it's pretty on par with other places in the city, and I liked that it was on site and underground). The rooms were nice, clean, and comfortable. Nothing fancy, but had everything you could... More"
"140",4,"Bad: It's very expensive to park near the hotel, breakfast was not very impressive, some of smaller things like slippers were missing. Good: Everything was pretty good, helpful staff, great location."
"141",3,"Too much construction all around Jan. 2016--the street, two hotel buildings behind and adjacent made it very noisy!! Check this before booking...Rooms large, good cleaning service, helpful staff at front desk. Street parking is difficult to find...beware of towing."
"142",5,"Bad: The room was really small. With two large suitcases, we could hardly move in it. Good: Location, staff, bar with complimentary drinks"
"143",3,"Decor was nice, and room was comfortable enough. Felt there was poor temperature control/ air circulation was poor, even with room fan on it felt too warm. Location in proximity to harbor was very convenient, with everything within walking distance."
"144",4,"Just stayed for 1 night because a friend was coming in from out of town. Unable to check-in early, but got a call as soon as the room was ready. Room was very clean. Small, but nicely appointed and comfortable. Nice bathroom, aside from some trouble in turning on the cold water for the sink (handle was difficult to turn). It also took a long time for the shower to warm up. Free wifi is excellent in this hotel."
"145",4,"After reading other positive reviews about this property on Trip Advisor, I decided to book it. So glad I did! The hotel is located right on U.S. 1 and easy to find and convenient to the public beaches, restaurants and shopping. The exterior is okay (see my photo) but once inside, you'll find it to be very clean and inviting.... More"
"146",5,"Bad: Breakfast. Good: Excellent family enjoyed everything. Staff friendly and helpful. Arrived early gave phone number and they called when room was ready 2 hours before check in. Location wonderful for us, we walked every where. Direct access to beach. Outside pool great, food there was good too and not to pricey. Overall great stay. Well worth the price. U get what u pay for. Breakfast could have been a lil better, my personal opinion."
"147",4,"The hotel itself is older and the rooms need a few updates . The lobby/pool area is awesome!!!! Great play areas for older and younger kids. Air conditioner super noisy. Beds were very comfy. Great value ."
"148",5,"Great for short business trip."

"150",4,"We had a microwave and fridge in the room. The room showed typical wear-and-tear of most moderately priced motels, but overall it was clean and the bed was comfortable, though a bit high. We were toward the back so had a bit of a walk to the front desk and adjoining restaurant, but that was okay. The staff was nice... More"
"151",5,"It is a very quiet , comfortable and safe hotel. The hotel have a small inside pool and a very good hot tube. My family like it."
"152",5,"Bad: The last night there was a prom. I guess one of the parties decided to continue in to the night next door. Loud talking and slamming of the doors,up until 3 am. The desk knew about it when I called but nothing was done. I will never stay there again, paying so much and living like a Days Inn. All the desk could say was they were sorry. Good: The staff and extras were good. The room was nice and view was good. Comfortable room. Loved the crabby evening activities."
"153",3,"ote: 3 stars means a slightly above average grade, similar to a C+ in academics As most reviews note, this is a very historic/rustic building and thus should not be directly compared to other modern 4 diamond hotels with much newer buildings, plumbing, furniture, etc. That said, once you get past the lobby of the Benson, the concern to keep...

"156",4,"I was blown away by the lobby and halls. Our room was less than spectacular as it was a hotel tonight booking and probably was the last room in the building overlooking an alley. Even so the small room we had was well worth the money and did the trick."
"157",3,"The room was outdated but yet cozy. Love the fireplace in the room. Even though no hot tub in our room we still had a relaxing time. Blast from the past! I would ask for or bring an extra blanket can get a little chilly if the fire place goes out. Will go back and stay again soon. Room 213"
"158",4,"My daughter and I have stayed for 5 nights here during our visit to New Orleans. Very cute hotel, modern design, good vibe, friendly staff! We've got a nice corner room at 14th floor, beds were so comfortable and everything is new and clean! Walking distance from French quarter, Bourbon street, Lafayette square, we didn't even use any transportation beside the street car to get to the City Park. Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. Our guest comments are very important to us, they allow us an opportunity to celebrate our successes while also finding ways we may improve. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to New Orleans.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager"

The rooms have very comfortable beds with modern flat screen TV's. The pool is rooftop and has great views of the city. I highly recommend requesting a room on the... More"
"161",5,"This is a great Hampton. The lobby is huge, and there's more than enough room to spread out for breakfast. My corner room was terrific, looking right out on the legendary theater, First Avenue and 7th St. Entry. I had reserved a King, and there was a couch, desk and plenty of floor room to pace around (something I never... More"
"162",4,"Lovely hotel. The pool is small but was lots of fun for the young kids with us. The lifeguard was fantastic and gave the boys lots of toys to play with. Even in the cold everywhere we wanted to go was walking distance. We'll definitely stay here again."
"163",5,"I can't say enough about the Suncoast!! My brother lives in Las Vegas, so as far as the Strip - we have been there, done that. If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast."
"164",5,"Bad: No microwave. Good: The shower was amazing"
"165",3,"Good price for location - a Midway airport hotel. At about 3 miles distant, it's about 1 mile farther out than the main 'hotel row' but still close to all the amenities - restauarants, grocery stores, etc.The hotel was showing its age a little but was comfortable, quiet and adequate. No complaints. Nothng to write home about either."
"166",4,"This is my second time staying at the Aria. It truly is a fantastic place to stay while in Vegas even now. The casino and resort feels very upscale and some how though its packed it never feels crowded. It has wonderful high ceilings unlike some other casinos so you never feel closed in. The pool is also fantastic. I... More"
"167",3,"Bad: in old town, far away from new main strip noisy air-con in room decor abit old. Good: cheap buffet with good quality big room comfort bed"
"168",5,"We stay here whenever visiting Boise. Good rooms, nice evening reception with two free drinks (with snacks) and great breakfast included with room. They even let us leave our car here for three weeks to save on parking at airport. There is a movie theater across the road and some good restraints available in the neighborhood."
"169",4,"We stayed at the Wilderness Inn for the past two nights while enjoying Wallowa Lake, Joseph, the fireworks and the entertainment in Joseph. This hotel was one of the only ones with openings. We got a room with two queen beds which was clean, had great water pressure in the shower. We had no refrigerator or microwave but we made... More"
"170",5,"Bad: WiFi was not working sometimes. Breakfast is pretty boring. Good: Nice location and hotel itself. The staff is nice and helpful."
"171",5,"Near I-55 and restaurants/shopping/movies. Staff was very friendly. Room was nice and fresh. The toiletries they provide are Neutrogena, which are of good quality. The small executive center was nice and printouts were free."
"172",5,"Overall very pleased with hotel. Though there technically was plenty of space, the porta-crib barely fit between the beds. Room was very clean. Liked having the fridge. Bathroom clean. Wifi worked well. Good selection of tv channels, though we didn't watch it too often. Maid did go in one day while we were out despite the do not disturb sign being on door, which makes me uncomfortable, but it was all good. Breakfast was nice in having many choices. Area wasn't first choice, but we weren't going to pay those prices. Convenient to most everything we wanted to do."
"173",4,"For a very small town out in the middle of nowhere, you will not find anything better. In fact, it is above average, even compared with its big city counterparts. Clean, well-maintained and comfortable. That's all we ask. The breakfast was the weakest link, but that has become standard for pretty much every place that offers the routine continental fare."
"174",5,"The hotel was centrally located to where I needed to be. It is about 10-15 minutes from the Scranton Wilkes-Barre airport. The hotel entrance is a bit hidden from the main road. You must make a sharp turn then go up an incline before you see the main building and parking lot. Leaving, use caution as you must turn onto... More"
"175",1,"Bad: Please take heed to this warning do not stay here. My car along with 3 other guest cars staying at this hotel were broken into overnight. The hotel didnt try to make us feel more safe or accommodate us.. They do not care at all. If you are trying to save money dont chance it by staying here unless you want your car broken into and you want your property stolen. It's not worth it you are better off staying in another hotel. This ruined our trip and we didn't feel safe staying there and management doesnt care at all also.. There is no security gaurds or cameras on this property so ask yourself if you want to be next. ."
"176",5,"We were tired from a very long drive from Boston and were very happy with everything that we saw. The staff were very professional and very nice. The bed was very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place. The Breakfast was very varied and great. Everything was fresh."
"177",5,"Beautiful part of Denver. Easy access to freeways and so, to other parts of town. Nice choice of restaurants, and grocery stores. Enjoyed having a room with a kitchenette. Mostly appreciated the friendly and helpful staff. Easy five stars all around for this property."
"178",1,"When I first got in the room I didn't remove my jacket because it was so cold. The room takes forever to heat up. The blankets are very thin. They are actual blankets, not your typical hotel comforter. This would be okay IF the room wasn't a freezer. - This hotel does not care when you have issues with things which is unusual but at least other hotels try to improve your experience. - I got sick because the room was so COLD and since I had a sore throat the next morning I called for a late checkout and of course they couldn't do it. Other less important things: TV movie ordering did not work and when I called the front desk they said they would send someone and never did"
"179",4,"This was our first time in Baltimore, and the neighborhoods are hit or miss there. This was a pretty good part of town- not much there yet. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel had a smell to it though- there were smoking rooms I think- but the hallway was very musty. Everything looked clean though. The location must have been a newly developed area, there was not much right by the hotel- but it was convenient to hop on the interstate. All in all, we would stay here again"
"180",2,"We had a king suite with sleeper sofa for three adults. We arrived at about 1'0:30 pm tired from our trip only to find out there were no sheets or pillows for the sleeper sofa. It took two trips to the desk to get what we needed. Then we discovered that the sleeper sofa was hard as concrete. Folded it... More"
"181",4,"Stopped here for an overnight traveling through Atlanta. The desk clerks at night were excellent. I had a problem turning my TV on - the lady at the desk came to my room to set it up. Sign in the lobby indicates they are going to start renovations soon-which are much needed - hotel was dated."
"182",4,"We chose Holiday Inn Express- Ashley River, because the rate was considerably lower than the hotels in the center of the historic district. While our choice meant we could not walk to the historic area, the free shuttle worked out well for us. The location was convenient for our visit (driving our own car) to the Magnolia Plantation and a dinner in Mount Pleasant. The hotel was was clean and our breakfast was great. Parking is free ... A bonus. Staff was friendly."
"183",4,"Perfect location to begin your exploration of Napa wine country. Tom at the registration desk was wonderful, he could not have been nicer and more helpful. Our room was large and clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. Would absolute stay here again!!!Janly - Wow! Thank you for your kind review. I will make sure Tom sees it as well, he is pretty wonderful. We are so thrilled you enjoyed your stay and we can't wait to see you again. Genafer, Director of Sales"
"184",3,"Very very very disappointed in the happy hour. Lines were extremely long 10 to 12 people at a time. Very difficult to get a drink. Bartender was waiting on entire bar plus our seating area plus customers who wanteddrinks. The drinks may as well not have been free. Snacks were sparse and not replenished."
"185",4,"Bad: Old, not many outlets. Good: Location and price."
"186",1,"The old Aztec Hotel on foothill blvd, ( route 66) was a gem, back in its day. Unfortunately for the past ten years while the hotel was under poor management it was never maintained. The entire establishment is dirty and run down. The rooms are very small, which was typical for hotels during that era. Some staff are friendly, others were not willing to help when needed. Bar is a local hangout with a pretty good Band. The property needs a complete overhaul."
"187",4,"Bad: The music in the lobby was horrendous. House music that made me want to die or run away with my hands over my ears. Totally cruel to make the hotel receptionists listen to that all day long and it made the lobby an undesirable place to spend time. They should be playing jazz or something easy on the ears. Good: Location and room/decor, amenities"
"188",4,"Very nice place, the room zone heating and cooling was either to hot or when OFF to cold with the outside temp at 30, the room cooled down pretty quick and got cold. This place is a very good value at 50 per night compared with what is in the area. YES, Id stay here again in a heart beat."
"189",5,"The room was a little small but was right on the beach with a large balcony. It had a fridge and a microwave. The non oceanfront rooms are across the street as is the outdoor pool and additional parking. The free breakfast was good and open until 10:00. Everything was clean!"
"190",5,"Hampton Inn is the best hotel we've ever visited. The beds are so comfortable. The complimentary breakfast is delicious (and includes protein foods). The hotel staff is obviously carefully chosen and well trained. They were all very friendly and helpful. We felt so welcome. I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn to everyone."
"191",5,"Beautiful place near Bourbon Street but quiet. Staff was warm and welcoming, rooms were very clean and full of charm. Would recommend to anyone. Very close to restaurants and other places to visit. Great trip. Thank you"
"192",5,"We stayed at this lovely Inn and hotel for 3 nights while I attended a recent conference also hosted by the hotel. I brought my husband and daughter along to enjoy some Connecticut sun.

"203",4,"Suncoast is off the strip about 20-30 minutes depending on how you drive. Vegas is easy to get around if you do rent a car. I have stayed in several LV hotels both on and off the strip but I honestly can say I was surprised at how nice the rooms were. The views are spectacular - mountains and golf courses- very peaceful. I'm a corner checker - I hate to see dirt in the corners of the bathrooms - every square inch was spotless! The crisp snow white bed covers reassured me of the cleanliness. We felt like we had a suite by both the size and the amenities. As we kept late nights we wanted to sleep The choice of restaurants is nicely varied and even has a Seattle's Best for the coffee drinker. They bring in some great music bands. I can't say enough about the well mannered and pleasant staff. Despite the line up check in was quick and pleasant. Loved the pool hot tub with the views of the mountains. Close to great shopping (5 min walk) , 15 minute from Red Rock Canyon State Park( rock climbing, varied degrees of hiking easy to tough), 20 min to Bonnie Springs (rustic restaurant, zoo fun for all ages) I would recommend this hotel without reservation!"
"204",3,"I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team"

I was not made aware, in advance that the room was so designed. I am 6'4, so the accommodations were unusually uncomfortable for me. I was offered another room, but the hotel was unable to change my room due to it being reserved and paid via Expedia. I contacted Customer Service, and it is now 21 days, and I have yet to receive a response. I paid for 3 days, but only stayed for 2, as the accommodations were just unacceptable. I spent my last night at a competing hotel for about the same price, without issue. Of course I did not reserve that room via Expedia."

"229",4,"You have to be prepared for anything at a hotel within this price range, but I was surprised to find that it was clean and decently maintained. The price was right for me, so I think overall it was worth it. I stayed there on a Friday night and didn't notice any loud people or drunks in the area."
"230",3,"We made a last minute reservation because of location and price (which at 157 a night wasn't really a bargain) for this hotel. The location is great, you can walk to some shops and eateries. It is a short drive or bike ride to the beach which is nice. Our first room had a faulty air conditioner and the room was super musty. That being said, the hotel staff was GREAT and got us another room. They continued to be really helpful and friendly throughout the stay. The room was really tight for a 5 night stay and I'd only recommend this for 1 maybe 2 nights tops. The pool was clean and the free breakfast was so/so.

"238",3,"Make sure you do not get a room with a generator and Air con units directly outside of the windows. Very noisy and low occupancy the night I checked in. The hotel should be aware of this and take action not to give to guests when occupancy is low"

"255",1,"Avoid. Nothing good to say. The list goes on and on. Beds not made, no toilet paper, botched room assignments, mixed-up special events. The parking lot has recently been re-paved, everything else is broken. Something is wrong at the top here as evidenced by the total disorganization."

But lots of places nearby that serves breakfast. Location. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see."
"268",5,"Stay was perfect for a family reunion of sorts. We utilized the spacious lobby and found the staff to be more than accommodating! Thank you to all!"
"269",1,"I was told at check in there is a 7.00 per day charge for your vehicle for parking. I did not mind this but it is not explained to you on the information of the hotel when booking. The real problem I had was that I had absolutely no hot water to shower with in the morning when I was getting ready for work. I called the front desk and received NO consideration at all. I am a vietnam veteran and I swore I would never take another cold shower so I had to go to work without bathing. NOT FUN!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for breakfast when I reserved the room but I did not receive any coupon at check in and was not told I needed one. After getting dressed, I went to the breakfast area but was not allowed in because I did not have a coupon. I WAS SO UPSET AT THIS POINT THAT I JUST CHECKED OUT AND LEFT. I expressed my feelings to the front desk and they said they could not do anything for me because no one from mainteanace was at work yet. This all happened between 5:45 AM and 6:30 AM"
"270",5,"We booked in here due to an early morning flight. It was a little more expensive than what we usually pay for when staying at a hotel but it was definitely worth it. Very lovely clean room, and the staff were very helpful and polite. The only downside was (upon checking out) the early morning shuttle driver was running a little late, and due to the amount of people and luggage, was stressed and became rude when trying to squeeze the last few people on the shuttle......however the shuttle driver the day before was very friendly and helpful so it all evened itself out."

Room spacious and clean, heater efficient but pretty noisy, noise from corridor is also thereService could be better - at 0130 at night got a phone call from night manager to immediately re-park the car (evening manager allowed the parking at particular slot). It was outrageousWifi was great and coffee available. For very reasonable price and 1 night stay you can't wish for better"
"288",3,"The hotel was nice. The hallways were nasty though. The floor looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in months. The pool room was freezing. Couldn't take our 18 month swimming for very long. The hot tub stopped working our second day there. Was the same temperature as the pool. Otherwise, very nice, spacious hotel. Friendly staff. Just a couple of things to work on."

"305",5,"Good: We liked that breakfast was served until 10am. Traveling with young adults and children, it makes for a hectic morning when we have to get to breakfast by 9am. It was a nice, short walk to the Maryland Science Museum and National Aquarium. We were prepared for below average temperatures, so were able to enjoy our stroll around the harbor. We also appreciated that we were able to keep our vehicle parked at no extra cost for several hours past checkout time."
"306",4,"Everything in the hotel was nice. The only thing about the king sized non-smoking room was the AC didn't work properly. When you put it on full blast it felt like its 70 degrees not 60 degrees. However overall everything was nice."

Our newest surprises in store are a workout room, business center and guest laundry. We should have them up and running by your next visit to Napa. ps: sorry to ruin the surprise!"
"314",5,"I cannot recall the last time I had an issue at a Drury Inn. Well, we did not have one at this location. The room was comfortable, the staff was attentive and helpful, and it was nicely priced more importantly, we got the last available room for the evening. Next, their complimentary breakfast was good, as well as their late afternoon meal from 5 PM 7 PM. Also, you have to have a key card to access their customer parking area. It was a nice feature which prevents people with ill intentions from driving around scoping out the scene."

The room has been refurbished but it's lacking coffee in the room, it's available by the front desk though. Nothing against the hotel (it's next to a Hilton who would have the same issue) but there are a lot of homeless in the area although they generally didn't cause much issue. It was noted the expensive hotels seem to have walkways above the pavements to avoid the riffraff, although I didn't really like the idea of rising above everyone else to be honest. Only a 5 min walk to Marta stations and downtown areas, 10 mins to the Olympic park area."
"339",4,"I stayed there for a week on business. There are three hotels and 4-5 restaurants right off of the expressway. The room was nice. The staff was friendly even when while I was leaving and I accidentally dropped a large bag of MMs all over the lobby near the elevators."

We first found out about this not having water in the toilet, That was eventually rectified but we did not have any hot water. After unloading a family ( 6 and 3 year old) in the desk staff told us to go to dinner and there SHOULD be hot water when we return, No t want to risk that option we ask for a refund and that we woudl be leaving. The desk staff was reluctant at first to give the refund but when I insisted because they could not guarantee hot water they finally did. They failed to understand that a hot water issue was a hotel problem not a City of Baltimore."

"351",4,"The location is very, very inconvenient, but I am sure that is nothing they can help, it is just how the city has grown around their location. I would have rated the room as a 4 or 5 for clean if the sofa was not so disgusting. I literally covered it with a sheet just to sit on it. There was not one inch of surface that was not covered with a greasy/dirty stain. I would have switched rooms if I hadn't already unloaded all of my stuff in the rain before I turned on the lights to reveal the nasty sofa. Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable. It would be worth a couple of hundred dollars to get a steam cleaner and clean the sofas in each room. Not to mention how unsanitary it is."
"352",5,"Good: Wonderful service, awesome riom service menu (especially the late night offerings). Awesome amenities."

"360",5,"Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!"
"361",5,"Very nice hotel...close to WWI Museum which we visited. Parking garage was close and secure. Room service was very nice and staff were quite courteous. Great view from upper floor (we were on floor 34 I think). Bed was quite comfortable. Price was reasonable for a Kansas City hotel in the middle of everything. Fridge in the room which is great. No free WiFi which REALLY chaps me for as much as one pays for hotels now...but overall a nice stay."

"376",3,"I have stayed here a few times and most recently this week. Their deluxe rooms are sub par, the ones with the golf view are somewhat better and worth the money. The Mediterranean two bedroom suite is a great value and the Presidential was a swing and a miss for us. All of the rooms are spacious, but the bedding in the deluxe rooms was uncomfortable. We never stayed in the one bedroom suite, but Med suite is very large with ample common space and generous sized bedrooms. The bathrooms are green granite which gives a nice feel to the room. We most recently stayed in a Presidential suite (one of four in the hotel) room 960. We were booked in the Med. suite, but decided to accept the up-sell upgrade and pay the extra 124 per night to check it out. While it is about 1,000 sq ft larger than the Med. the huge common area was wasted on the two of us. The two bedrooms were a bit larger with the king master offering a beautiful panoramic view of the golf course from the bathroom. The rest of the room has sweeping views of the mountains, once you get past the immediate view of the top of the parking garage. The master shower has a shower panel that looks to offer a variety of body jets with a shower head. The thing was awful with the only two options being the waterfall and shower head or just the waterfall. The first night the water barely got hot enough to take a shower. I reported the problems and they fixed the water temp but not the panel. The water in LV is very hard and this panel also had the classic green deposits that come from the water. You would think they could afford some CLR to clean the unitWhile I am on the soapbox, I must comment about their toiletries. The shower/bath soap was a tiny little white bar in a cheap cardboard box. The shampoo and conditioner were equally cheap, but the kicker was the hand/face soap. It was a little round disc in a plastic package. When I opened it to use it, I thought it was a recycled soap piece! It had no lather and was just crap. If anyone from the property reads this, you really need to re-think these products as they scream CHEAP. The rest of the facility is a midstream casino/resort experience. Granted, you are not on the Strip, but there are nicer neighborhood properties in the area. The newly added The Game sports bar and Subway are decent. The Deli. offers a great value for your money albeit with a limited menu. There is also a movie theater and a variety of other restaurants that we didn't try. The pool appears to be small for the property, so investigate it further if you plan to spend much of your stay at it. The staff are all very friendly and there is ample and easy parking. Overall, not a bad place, but just OK.Thank you for posting your comments on your recent stay. I have sent your comments to our Facilities and Housekeeping teams to address. I hope the next time you stay you will take the time to enjoy all the amenities our property has to offer. Have a nice day."

"379",3,"The Holiday Inn Express is on the north side of town in an area with other hotels, some restaurants and some box stores. The receptionist was friendly, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Rooms have fridges, irons and TVs with a good selection of channels. Breakfast is included in the price. The bedroom was attractively furnished. The bathroom was a bit dowdy. But the hotel did what was needed - provide a safe and comfortable place to spend the night while on the road."

"385",3,"Stayed one night at this Best Western for a half marathon the next morning. Overall, hotel gave the impression of being slightly dingy and outdated and was the type of hotel where all the rooms are accessed from an outdoor hallway. The service was friendly and helpful and the room was relatively clean and comfortable enough. Some stains on the carpet at the door though. Did not eat the breakast since we were up early for the race but I saw at check in that the dining room spilled out into the lobby which I thought was a little crowded looking to say the least. Great location as it was close to the plethora of wineries nearby and also close to several shopping and dining areas. Close to major highways without being noisy too. Next time I'd search for a slightly nicer hotel but this visit was satisfying for our needs."

"395",5,"My wife and I stayed at the Virginian Suites for 8 days in October. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay. The only drawbacks were the lumpy pillows and the dripping bathtub (it was in another room, however, and was not a distraction except when one was in the bathroom). We brought it to the attention of the staff as we checked out and they said they would send someone up to look at it. The hotel setting is lovely - just a short walk to a lovely park and the Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington Cemetary. There are two restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel and leftovers can easily be kept and reheated in the suite's compact kitchen. There is ample parking on the premises for automobiles and the hotel shuttle makes morning and evening runs to the nearest metro station (which is walkable in a pinch) and will take you to the grocery store as well. The suites are large and comfortable and we will probably use them again if we return to Washington."

"398",5,"I was impressed as soon as I walked in the lobby. It was neat, clean, interesting and nicely decorated. Also, just walking down the hall to your room. It zig zags a bit but its so much nicer than walking down a straight hall of doors. Likewise, room large spacious, 2 queen beds, separate living area with a pull... More"
"399",5,"We stayed here two nights and boy I wish it was more. Great fun for my kids 10,12. The service is fantastic! Mercy at the front desk couldn't do enough for us.

"400",5,"When we walked into the office Yolanda had a big smile on her face and welcomed us into the hotel. We actually live in south Florida but decided to get a room for a friends birthday and she has assured us that we will enjoy ourselves and if we have any questions she is more than happy to answer them... More"
"401",5,"We stayed in double queen. It was very spacious. The neighborhood was great. Felt very comfortable there. It's a nonresidential area by the freeway with restaurants nearby. The freeway was a little loud in the mornings and there was some construction going on right outside the hotel. They should be done with the construction there in about a week. It woke us up very early one morning. I told the manager about it and he was happy to switch our rooms if we wanted. We chose to stay in the same room. It was less noisy the next morning without the jackhammer going. The kids even enjoyed watching the big excavator going. The even numbered rooms may be less noisy. Breakfast was decent. Scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, cereal, and donuts. The indoor pool is small. It would maybe fit 15-20 people. There were 12 people when we went and was already getting crowded. Exercise room has an elliptical and recumbent bike only. The staff were very nice. We would stay there again."
"402",1,"Worse place ever.rooms were dirty no clean linen smelly everywhere.Owners were not there to get refund.wish we did not check in.Maid did not want to clean the dirty room said not feeling good.THISPlace is a DUMP!!!"
"403",5,"Bad: Its not something i didn't like, its more like a recommendation since its not something quite important, and actually i don't know if other rooms have it but particularly my room didn't have a big mirror other than the one in the bathroom. Also, i think breakfast can be maybe until 11:30am, like other restaurants or hotel provide, more like a brunch style and serve more options. Good: Really modern hotel, very very clean room almost like if we were the first to use it, excellent staff. We arrived at 10am approximately since our flight was early in the morning and they managed to give us an available room. hotel is at an excellent location since its ocean drive but not at the crowded noisy part so we could party, and still be able to rest and sleep well!"
"404",4,"Bad: Buffet food."
"405",3,"The bed was broken but was still comfortable, just a bit sunken in. The floor was a bit dirty but overall everything was good."
"406",5,"We really liked the service, location and quality of everything here. The staff was super nice! The rooms were clean, the bathrooms were clean and the breakfast had many choices. The check in process was easy."
"407",5,"Wife and I wanted to stay in a hotel on the beach with smoking accomodations inside the room. We found this hotel to not only be comfortable, but very very clean and spacious. It reminded us of our stay in the residence inn in California. Would definately recommend to others in this location."
"408",3,"This hotel was fine, as airport inns go, but not great. The staff was very friendly, and the shuttle driver was more accommodating than most would have been, so I'd give the staff all five stars. The room was clean and comfortable I was able to keep it pretty cool in there, which is always nice. However, the plumbing... More"
"409",3,"Bad: The airconditioner in the room did not work, and it made a very loud sound all night. We told the front desk and they were able to fix it for the next night stay. It's understandable because the hotel itself is very old. We would probably stay in a different hotel when we go back. Good: Staff was very helpful and nice. Tony Romo's restaurant was very good."
"410",4,"Close to all the beautiful beaches. Resort appears outdated from the outside but pretty nice inside the rooms. Tiki bar is the gem of the resort, what a fun time. Would come back for sure. Bath tub was a little gross, shower head was shady but sht happens!"

"415",4,"El hotel en general de muy buena calidad y a buen precio. Solo que un poco alejado del centro y lugares de interes, pero muy recomendable para caminar y conocer un poco mas de la ciudad."
"416",5,"Good: Excellent breakfast"
"417",5,"Last minute trip to enjoy Christmas break. Location was great for walking everywhere. Went to a football and basketball game. The hotel staff is amazing. Scott was helpful all weekend. The rest of the staff were friendly, outgoing, and very knowledgeable about the area.That's what we like to hear!! Scott will be thrilled to hear he made an impact. Thanks for staying and we hope to see you again soon. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"418",3,"Lots of activity under way to improve the hotel. They have some new eating places coming in soon. The new Game Place sports bar had great food and drinks. The bartender Angela was friendly and helpful.Rooms are spacious and quiet. Beds were comfortable when you are finally ready to crash. My room was clean and no complaints about maid service,I used the shuttle service to return to the airport and this was a nice savings over a cab or rental car.Downside / upside is that this is a LONG way from the strip. You can walk to a few places. A few gold courses are next door, with Angel Park and Badlands on either side. I would not want to stay here more than two nights without a car to get out more.The players club had ZERO points gifts except in small or medium sizes. How is that possible. F minus. Many employees were friendly and helpful. Room rates were very reasonable compared to the Strip."
"419",5,"We stopped in Elko for the night on April 2 on the way to Reno. The place is not fancy, but the room was clean, decent sized and the beds were comfy. Bathroom was good. Shower worked well.

"422",5,"Just got back from an amazing weekend at the St. Regis. We used our starpoints to reserve a night at the St. Regis in celebration of our anniversary. I had high hopes for a Category 7 hotel - and St. Regis did not disappoint! We'd had a bit of a rough journey, but from the moment Pascal took our bags to Jose at the front desk checking us in, Ildna showing me to the fitness room where I could have a little workout before our room was ready - everyone took such great care of us. We will definitely be back!Dear Traveller94115, We are very pleased to learn that Pascal, Jose and Ilona all provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York. Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

"423",5,"My husband has been working hard an hour away from home every week day. I surprised him with this little get away.I had no problem finding this hotel off the highway. Plenty of parking and close to the restaurant we went to. The check in was quick and easy! The lobby and grounds were beautiful and clean. The room was comfortable and had everything we needed for our date night! Thank you so much!"
"424",5,"Good: Staff were all extremely friendly. Hotel was clean."
"425",3,"Lets start with the good stuff. Location is perfect. The hotel lobby is 5 star and the rooftop pool and bar/dining area looks like just what youd expect in glamorous Hollywood, or even South Beach. Everyone on staff seemed incredibly nice and friendly. The rooms, especially the suites, were very, very spacious, among the largest Ive seen in this class... More"
"426",5,"3rd Floor, Ocean View, Deluxe room made great memories with my significant other. They gave us a free breakfast down the road and they let us check out a little later. Overall this was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again."
"427",5,"I was extremely impressed with the room. We booked a two bedroom. Both rooms had king beds. This was not like any other Residence Inn- everything was on one floor and the entrance is not outside- it's very classy. I felt like I was in an extremely expensive hotel. I'm definitely staying here again!"
"428",4,"Stopped in for evening on way north to Buffalo. This was our second Home2 booking of the year. Overall, I rate the hotel well.

"444",5,"The staff was friendly, professional and helpful. The accommodations were clean and convenient to all the local attractions."
"445",3,"Bad: Check in staff was rude. Concierge never called back after leaving my information. Doors slamming in hallway could hear in my room. Double Queen Room was not a true Queen size. Have to pay for wifi. Good: Atmosphere Bedding Location"
"446",4,"Up to HGI standards. Expensive bar drinks but comfortable and close to I10. Quality breakfast (free to Diamond members) Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff throughout. Great accommodations for the price and close enough to FSU campus."
"447",4,"Bad: Sofa bed very uncomfortable. Good: Great restoration of classic building close to sports, shopping and financial district."
"448",5,"If you want to experience the perfect city hotel in New York with everything from service, location and friendliness this is perfect.We spend Christmas here and it was amazing. The room was very nice, quiet and with a fantastic bed and everything. The service at the reception was very good and also during the rest of the stay.The butler service was also very good. We will definitely come back. The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time with us, and hope that you will return to NYC soon. We thank you for your comments regarding the lights at breakfast. We greatly appreciate your feedback and will share your comments with our team.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager"
"449",4,"Stayed here with a few friends for a weekend getaway. Nice bar/lounge in the lobby area with a decent sized commissary with snacks and drinks for sale. The rooms were nice and new. We watched some of the NCAA games in our room and the tv was a bit smaller than I would like but it was still a good picture. The location is probably the best part. Its about 3 blocks from Bourbon St which means its a short walk but far enough away not to be impacted by the noise. There still is some construction going on and the pool will not be completed until May, but overall, still a very solid stay.It's always great to hear that we have another satisfied guest! It seems to be a consensus that our location is key to having access to all that New Orleans has to offer yet far enough away to relax peacefully. Thanks, Kristi"
"450",4,"It's too bad there's no continental breakfast. But the room was suprisingly comfortable for the price."
"451",5,"Bad: Highly recommend. Good: Modern style, great location, super helpful staff, continental breakfast included, great value, clean"
"452",2,"This is a pet friendly hotel. Having said that, it smells like a pet friendly hotel that does not get a thorough cleaning after a dog has been sick. We were booked into our first room which smelled like a mixture of beef jerky and vomit. Our second room was a little better, but we still had to go buy several candles to make the room habitable. The carpet was sticky, and the sheets were full of holes. The bathtub looked like someone took a blowtorch to a corner. The carpet in the halls is in a severe need of cleaning. Many spots and traffic patterns. The breakfast was good if you like lots of carbs. I came away feeling gross and dirty even after a shower."

"455",3,"Stay is pleasant however, very expensive and staff no more helpful than in other hotels. We are here for a special occasion, on Checkin hotel asked this - we were hoping for upgrade or something, but nothing! Then other members of group arrived and they were upgraded! Typical, no luck! Location is excellent."
"456",5,"Wonderful rooms. Comfy beds. Great shower. Kind, pleasent courteous desk staff. Good value for the quality. A pleasure."

"458",5,"Worth staying here - great breakfast."
"459",5,"The hotel was in a convenient location and had a friendly staff. Breakfast and snack selection were good as well as fresh. Check in/check out quick. spacious lobby, comfortable beds and pillows. The hotel was quiet and easy to find off the highway."
"460",4,"Good: Its location."
"461",1,"I stayed here for one night because the official hotel for the Trenton Half was booked by the time I knew I would need a room. I've had good experiences at other Comfort Inns so I figured this was a safe choice. When I walked in the lobby looked like it was under renovation. Not a big deal. What was... More"
"462",4,"Stayed at this property while on a convention. Hotel is on an old building but nicely renovated. Noise is a problem, though bring ear plugs or ask for a room that doesn't face the street side, as the party goes on all night."
"463",5,"The Troubadour was an awesome hotel for us! I absolutely LOVED the decor. The bed side tables couldnt be beat! The roof top bar was an incredible view and it was even more special because thats where my boyfriend proposed! I couldnt ask for a better view. Its a nice central location and the food market next door was awesome! The only thing I wish was better was the valet service. They werent very timely and one of them gave us serious attitude. Other than that it was incredible and I would 100 go back!! Thank you so much for taking the time to share this lovely review of your stay with us at The Troubadour. It was truly our pleasure to be a part of this special moment and congratulations on your engagement. We appreciate having you stay with us and look forward to having you back as our guest anytime your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,"
"464",5,"A little pricey, however the location and service was excellent. Breakfast is not the best, at least as a Diamond level is complementary. I highly recommend this property, location, staff and rooms are excellent. Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay and we are delighted to know you enjoyed almost everything about your stay. We are currently transitioning our restaurant and trying out some new items and processes, please know that the breakfast service will improve as this is a main priority. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and do hope to have you stay with us again.Best regards"

"466",2,"Hotel was fine, big room, great view...but having to pay for WiFi, after paying so much for a room, as well as free WiFi for non-residents in the lobby? Over priced restaurant and bar, the top view is only for VIP guests, loads of people attending a conference over everywhere.....wouldn't stay here again. Disappointed after paying so much money then being asked to pay more for the basics...especially with the more attractive alternatives nearby."
"467",5,"Super close to things but off a main road so it isnt super busy or loud. Close to the beach, shopping center, and everything else you could need! The employees were helpful and cheerful. I couldn't ask for a better weekend trip. If you're staying for a long time, the rooms were spacious, and had full kitchens !"
"468",5,"The staff was courteous, the hotel was right off the highway and close to good dining options, as well as a gas station, but quiet. The neighbourhood is decent and pleasant to walk around.

"472",3,"Bad: I rely a lot on wifi at a hotel. The wifi was inconsistent."
"473",5,"No problem - complimentary breakfast was ready and waiting for us - found everything satisfactory"
"474",4,"We stay at this hotel three times this past year while visiting my husbands brother who has been ill. The hotel has friendly personnel and the rooms were clean we would stay there again anytime we come back to the Danville area."
"475",5,"Amazing place. Everyone was extremely warm and welcoming. We've stayed at some top notch places and this is definitely in our top 2. Great for a romantic getaway or take the kids along as we did. Had a couple stuffed animals waiting for our girls upon arrival. Can't wait to go back."
"476",2,"We were in town to visit with our daughter and also see my brother. We stayed at the Hyatt House. The staff was friendly but not very empowered. Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait. The breakfast buffet was good, but they did not always restock items (including coffee lids) in a timely fashion. I don't recommend this hotel."
"477",5,"The 2 room suite was great and the overall service was outstanding. The price of the suite was very reasonable. The provided Breakfast was great and the front desk personnel were outstanding. We could not have asked for better service. We will stay there on all of our trips to Phoenix."

"482",3,"This is an older property but it's clean. Nothing fancy, and I wouldn't recommend this for more than a night, but it was fine for what we needed. Breakfast was okay - more cold carbs than anything else! There is a Denny's in the parking lot as a back-up!"
"483",4,"I had a very nice stay at the Virginian Suites. They are remodeling the hotel, and you can really tell by the quality of the room. It was very modern, clean, and comfortable. My only complaints are thus- the hotel is extremely difficult to find. I suppose that's not the hotel's fault, it is a very confusing area of town anyways. Also, I was not aware that I would have to pay 7 extra dollars for parking. Just wish I would have been aware of this ahead of time. I would, however, stay there again."

"488",5,"Since we had a 7:55 a.m. flight to the West Coast, leaving from in an unfamiliar area, we chose the Virginian based on its proximity to the airport. The check in was easy, the printed directions to get to Reagan Airport were concise and re-explained verbally."
"489",5,"This is a nice hotel with great staff. I have young children and the entire staff from the front desk staff to the breakfast staff were there to help us. This was our first visit to the Portland area and we plan to go back later this summer. We will stay at this hotel when we return."
"490",5,"This rated very high in our stays across the US. Nothing to complain about and every thing to be pleased about. Looked to be freshly redone.

"495",5,"If you're visiting the beach stay here!! I'm a former local and know all about the excessive noise and confusion on the oceanfront. Stay at this lovely, quiet bay front hotel and drive to the craziness of the oceanfront when you want to go down there. Park in the municipal lot on Pacific and 19th street and you're in the heart of the tourist area. Take you own bikes and simply ride all over the boardwalk....then go back to a quiet comfortable relaxing hotel room."
"496",4,"The Fairfield Inn Tracy is located close to the highway. Therefore road noise can be heard. However, the hotel is clean and the staff is excellent. The noise will not wake you or annoy you but it is there. Close to shopping and restaurants. The Hampton Inn is across the parking lot and has the same noise issue."
"497",1,"I am on a business trip. The service is like dial up. I already changed rooms to get a signal. I am using my Iphone to connect. Talked to someone from their ISP named Kevin. Completely worthless. Never called me back and didn't fix a thing,"

"499",4,"I stayed at Aloft while attending a convention. It fulfilled all I sought. A modern and well run newer hotel away from the citys congestion well suited for a business traveler. It is a 15 minute walk to the convention center or you can take a shuttle one block away. Easy walk to the French Quarter. The rooms are sufficient and contemporary. Housekeeping was spot on and ranks high for cleanliness. The rooms start on the 11th floor so you are well above street traffic. I would suggest as others have to request a corner room with windows to avoid the cruise ship interior cabin feeling if you need it. Nice bar with specials and the rooftop pool is relaxing. Special mention needs to be extended to the hotels outstanding front desk staff specifically, Lindsey and Mark (who also worked the bar). Friendly, savvy, hardworking, and patient- they belong in hotel hospitality and deserve recognition. Their inherent superior communication skills exceed standard service training programs. I happily recommend this lodging while in NOLA!Our staff will be elated to hear of your stay with us. From housekeeping to the front desk and even the bar, it sounds like you enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. We hope to be your hotel of choice when in the Big Easy.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"

"501",5,"The staff was very helpful throughout my stay at this hotel. The hotel room was very clean. The breakfast that they serve every morning is great, and is a great deal. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Anaheim."

"507",5,"Other than being told on hotels.com that breakfast was included in our cost, but it wasn't, the stay was wonderful. We will be back. For being so close to the airport, no plane noise!!!!"
"508",4,"Was just a quick stay...late night in, morning out, but quite comfortable. Very nice accommodations, friendly staff, great breakfast area with room to spread out and get some work done. Aside from the extremely soft pillows, would definitely stay here again. Perfect location just 5 minutes from RDU airport and convenient to the entire metro area."
"509",5,"We got a great deal on a Queen Suite for an overnight stay during a wedding we attended in Clearwater. Suite was spacious and clean and could have easily fit six of us. Staff was friendly and location was conveniently located to some shops and restaurants. And about a ten minute drive to a really nice mall."
"510",5,"great location, great price, nice pool, ongoing upkeep apparent, best breakfast with many food choices, free parking"
"511",4,"Nice hotel clean, comfortable,close to restaurants and shops."
"512",1,"The purpose of my trip was to attend the wedding and reception of a friend's daughter. I was only driving up for this, and was not concerned about luxury and amenities. From the pictures, etc., that I viewed on-line, it looked like a good place for a brief stay. However, the whole hotel is in great need of maintenance work. The metal walkway and steps outside the rooms were rusty. The bathtub was old, caulking needed, mildew stains on a plastic towel holder. There were water spots on the sink handle when we arrived. Towels and washcloths provided were threadbare. Cigarette butts littered the parking lot and the metal walkway and steps. The advertised continental breakfast was definitely bare bones--bread, bagels, and waffles to pop in a toaster, cold cereal and milk, muffins, coffee, tea, and orange juice available. No yogurt or fresh fruit. Had I not prepaid for the room, I would not have stayed. My friend and I decided to wait to shower or bathe until we'd done the four-hour drive home."
"513",5,"I was very satisfied with my stay--nice property, lovely staff, well-maintained, and comfortable. The breakfast wasn't fantastic, but definitely serviceable, and the wifi was good and strong. Would stay again, for sure."

"516",4,"I was there for a week and my stay was very comfortable. The sheets are very soft and clean, the pillows were really plushie and the room was very clean. As a woman traveling alone, I felt safe inside the Hotel. The continental breakfast was very good but could have offered fruit."

"521",4,"Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel. The location alone makes this hotel worth it. Its located right by the Chicago river 1 block from the Magnificent Mile. There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel.The rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small. The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted.Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested.Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there.My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive. Its well hidden. If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far. As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms. They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time. Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair. Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again. It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible. They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city.All in all a great expericen for the price."

I believe it has been significantly renovated and they've done a great job!The location is excellent with a lovely view of the lake and walking distance to many restaurants, bars and sights. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the space needle and about 60 minutes to Pike's Place.However, I've only given this hotel a 4 rating as 430 for one night is crazy for this level of accommodation.Hello kmalho,Thank you for taking your time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel. Our hotel did go through quite a few renovations and I am pleased to hear that you liked it. We hope to have another opportunity serve you whenever your travels bring you back to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative"

This hotel is right off the highway and close to some decent restaurants. When we arrived they had a cooler full of lemon ice water and fresh popcorn. The breakfast was... More"
"526",1,"Other than the staff, this was the worst hotel experiences I and my traveling companions have ever had. Per the hotel manager there was an ant infestation they had resolved, they had not. Both my sister and I received several bug bites. Hoterl staff was nonesistent. We came back after being out and the one trash can was empied but sittting in the living area, the toilet paper had not been stocked and towels were left on top of our luggage as opposed to hung in the appropriate area, the toilet overflowed the first time we used it. And finally and most disgusting was that a used condom was ound in one of the nightstands (ewww). Now on to the facilities. The levator was out of order one night, unruly and unsupervised children were left to run roughshod over the pool area. We were subjected to splashes in our face, yelling and our belongings being knocked over (staff did not come to check even though everal adults complained). We spent a total of a half hour of our 3 day stay in the whirlppl finally giving up to sit on the sun deck in order to have some peace and quiet. Only issue with staff was when my sister went to the fornt desk to ask for a hand towel so that she could wipe the sweat of her face(August in Virgina is hot as Hades) and the desk personnel told her that they did not have any and gave her a bat mat instead. To reiterate, the entire experience beyond the pleasant staff was horrific... DO NOT STAY HERE!!!"
"527",4,"Bad: The only disadvantage is lack of elevator, however it's quite common in Ar Deco hotels. However you could ask for ground floor room. Good: I loved staying there. The hotel located between 4th and 3d streets. It's quiet part of seashore, there was much less noise than at Ocean drive. 5-7 min to the beach. Good wi-fi. Reasoable breakfast with cereals and cookies."
"528",3,"A really mixed bag. Great location (by Space Needle campus) and very nice rooms. The personal service that was so lauded was absent in our case...lots of newly hired and distracted 20 somethings at the desk. The view out the back is truly horrifying ... a crack house with squatters... but no spillover to the hotel. Lots of good restaurants... More"
"529",5,"The atmosphere of the hotel was excellent! Every staff worker that I encountered was extremely friendly and helpful! They were very informative as well in terms of the early continental breakfast that they serve and were all the amenities are located! The fitness center and the indoor heated pool and jacuzzi were very clean as well as my room. Overall, this was an enjoyable stay for me and I highly recommend this hotel to others. You will definitely be satisfied!"
"530",5,"This hotel puts Reading, PA back in the map. Great place to stay to celebrate, wedding, reunion, honeymoon, etc. Restaurant and Bar are excellent, breakfast is always scrumptious. The staff are very friendly, accomodating and knowledgeable. Lots of parking (garage).Thank you for the 5 star rating and review. We appreciate your comments. It was our pleasure having you as our guest."
"531",3,"This is a nice looking property so we decided to stay here. The staff was friendly at check-in. I got an AARP discount after asking for it. They were also pet friendly and allowed our small dog to stay for only 15. The rooms were comfortable and quiet. Everything worked and was clean. Check-out was pleasant. They gave us coupons...

"533",5,"Bad: The free shuttle maybe could be with reservation or something. Good: Clean, Tidy, Good breakfast, Nice bedrooms, Great Stuff. Recommended!!"
"534",2,"Well I thought for the price rate at the least you would get a good comfortable bed and a more professional look to bedding it looked so unprofessional who puts the pillows over the top comforter it makes me feel like the bed was sleep in . The office manager scott i think thats his name was very very rude... More"
"535",5,"Makeover was done well and not over the top. Dinner was good. Had the risotto. The chef has a mushroom obsession, so be forewarned. Breakfast was outstanding.

This is not Bricktown I don't understand why they are able to use that name. Not even close to Bricktown! Pillows smelled, beds hard, walls are dirty. One of the employees told me they have... More"
"537",3,"The room was very clean, but the AC could not be controlled and we froze at night. I could not turn it off and it ran all night long. I didn't have time to get the staff to fix it, so I just covered the vents with clothes to keep it from blowing out so much. We were still cold. The pool was nice, but the work out center was a joke and only on of three tread mills worked. And there was no weights or anything else. The Breakfast was a joke. There was only cereal and toast and that's it. We didn't even eat it, we just went out on our way to our events."
"538",3,"I stayed for one night on my way to Indiana. Let's just say that you get what you pay for. It's was an ok stay. The room was kinda small, it needed several touch ups on the furniture/bathroom fixtures, the pillows were not good for the neck, and the bathroom was tiny. The good things were that the customer service was good and it was a nice location for exploring around town."
"539",3,"Bad: 1. Elevator was broken room was on 3rd floor--moved after a time to another wing with working elevator. 2. Pool under repair--sent to another hotel--no available chairs at the pool - so no pool on a 95 day. Wasted 3 hours of the day. 3. Told there was a 30 minute wait to get a car from valet--called at 7:20 AM--valet was not told to get the car until 7:53 AM. Almost missed plane. Good: management staff was very good when they were there"
"540",4,"Quiet, clean, spacious. Only complaint is the beds were sacked out. We're traveling cross country and just need a place for a good night sleep and a shower for a reasonable price. This place fit the bill. Ate downtown at Buon Appetit and it was great also"
"541",5,"The air blowing from the furnace made the bedroom either too cool or too warm. Other than that I couldn't have been more pleased with every aspect of our stay at Sonesta. Thank you!"
"542",3,"Hotel is well situation on the road into Tupelo. It has plenty of parking and there are a couple of restaurants within walking distance which are good. Staff are helpful. Feels a little souless but it is good value for money and clean and tidy."
"543",3,"Bad: Room was dingy and not well maintained. Paint job was messy, wallpaper was bubbled. Bathroom sink and shower were dirty and old. Good: The bed was comfortable."

"548",3,"This hotel was fully adequate for our family. It was nothing fancy but it was absolutely fine for what it was. It's set in the middle of a million other hotels with a Target and Starbucks nearby. Good proximity to various attractions including Disneyland, and Chapman University. Quiet, convenient."

"555",3,"I found the hotel very nice. The rooms were clean, the hallways were clean and there was not a lot of noise. The beach is 'yucky', but the pool, the gym and the jacuzzi were very nice. If you eat at the TradeWinds restaurant, don't order the crab cakes. I'm still trying to decide what they tasted like. It certainly was not like a crab cake. Unfortunately, the hotel lost a customer for meals for the next 3 days, as we did not want to chance another food diaster."
"556",4,"The rooms were clean and beds extremely comfortable. Hot breakfast and dinner every day....dinner consisted of baked potato, cheddar cheese sause, hot dogs, salad and carrots, celery sticks every night. In addition, each night, there was at least one or more additional items - nachos/chicken tenders/etc. We arrived early in the morning and they were able to give us our room which was extremely nice. Staff was EXCELLENT. Every staff member we came in contact with was extremely helpful and friendly. Shuttle was efficient - ran every half hour.Only negativesThe pool was ok...a little smaller than pictured and chilly but the room was heated and the indoor/outdoor feature was nice. On the sunny days, outside pool was nice. The room had a desk, reclining chair and two dressers. Would have preferred a table with chairs over the 2nd dresser so we could play games in the room. Not a real problem....we just went to the lobby and used the tables there. Biggest complaint was with Travelocity. They were supposed to reserve a double bed room and booked us into a single king. My grandson was coming up for the weekend from his military base so it presented a little bit of a problem for one night. Their comment was they couldn't guarantee the room and we would just have to see if we could talk to the front desk. There were several soccer ball teams here when we checked in so there were no roll-away beds. We made do but it would have been better if they had made the reservation correctly to begin with. Will not book through them again.Overall...excellent experience. Even though there were several high school aged groups who were there during our stay...room was very quiet and no complaints with noise and everything was clean and well stocked."
"557",5,"Welcome to one of the most iconic and beautiful hotels of Manhattan! Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel.

"559",4,"Good: Comfortable Bed !"
"560",4,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here! It is mostly an average hotel, even a little run down in areas. BUT the incredible service (particularly from the Valet Parking staff) and close proximity to the Inner Harbor totally made up for all that. Highly recommend using their Valet service, the guys were very helpful and accommodating...they even let us keep our car there after we checked out and locked our luggage in the storage room at no extra charge! Not sure if this is part of their regular service, but we were sure happy with the arrangement! The beds were soft and super comfy, room was clean and relatively quiet from downtown noise, showers were hot with good pressure and breakfast the next day was decent. A solid choice for anyone on a budget wanting to be close to downtown!"
"561",5,"Location is perfect. We have stayed 5 to 6 times and always had a nice stay. Room is always clean. It is quiet and clean hallways. The staff does a good job of keeping the lobby and breakfast area very clean."
"562",3,"Como otras veces en este hotel. Tranquila y comoda, a pesar de la lejania y largo viaje en metro. Caminar desde la ultima estacion de metro hasta el hotel, se hace agradable y cerca de alli hay lugares para comer. Si no te gusta caminar, tienen shuttle bus y vas y vienes en el. Diversidad de opciones de comida. El precio es una buena razon para esto. Es barato a pesar de la temporada."

"564",5,"I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat if in the western NY area. Very helpful staff, nice room, good breakfast. Rachel at the front desk helped me out immensely with information in finding a restaurant."
"565",3,"This is a decent motel The staff is very friendly the breakfast is quite sparse compared to some other places at similar prices. Since there is no place to eat it they don't mind you taking something back to the room which I recommend over standing there at the front desk. All motels in Sunnyvale are expensive compared to similar places elsewhere so we have to factor that in to the price. I have stayed twice recently. All the rooms are not equal. The first one on second floor was a bit nicer because of the layout. The one downstairs in the back was more convenient for luggage, but the room layout was weird and not as comfortable. The immediate location is not great in terms of walking (there is only a Denny's next door), but its 5 minutes from downtown if you have a car."
"566",4,"Although there's no special amenities, it is clean and more than affordable. Typically we are out shopping when visiting the area so we spend little time in the room. If you are just looking for a place to lay your head and use the money you save for shopping, this is your place!! :)"

The staff was pleasant and provided a shuttle to and from the airport if needed. Ample parking space. Breakfast was included and had plenty to choose from and lots of seating."
"575",4,"Great family resort Plenty of rooms, your able to cook your own dinner to save some money or even barbecue by the pool. Kids loves the many different swimming pools. Close to everything, the times grocery store is right across the property. The beach is easy access, great place to watch the sunset."
"576",4,"Hotel staff was very friendly. Everything went great."
"577",4,"We stopped here on our way to drop our son off at Yale after a long day of traveling. Hotel was clean, quiet and well appointed. Couldn't ask for anything more.

"580",2,"When we booked there was nothing to say about a dance club open only Friday and Saturday nights right below our room2nd floor. Also this club is not owned by the hotel and you have to pay to get into it also open to 330am and LOUD.. There is nothing in the area for miles in which to have a top notch meal only fast food frightening at best to order. Shopping is very little. Not a very safe neighborhood. Driving there not very easy to find. If you are going to an NFL football game driving to game is actually very easy only about 5 minutes but to take any other means of transportation is way out of the way and expensive."

Overall, the location is great value. Just a 7 minute drive to Disney's Animal Kingdom. Excellent breakfast provided. Nice pool. Free parking. Free shuttle to parks. Lots of restaurants in the area. 30 minute drive from Orlando airport."
"586",4,"Bad: The valet parking was confusing. We ended up just using a parking lot around the corner. For the amount that we paid, I would hope that there would be free parking somewhere in the vicinity. Good: The breakfast was delicious and the staff was very friendly."
"587",5,"Hotel is in a great location, easy walk to inner harbor. Plenty of restaurants to chose from as well. Staff was super friendly, let us check in early and kept our bags after checkout."
"588",4,"it was nice went to Grants farm and the zoo and the hotel was swim and had lunch by the pool."
"589",5,"I was pleasantly surprised. Stayed 7 nights. Staff was friendly and accommodating. I wish I had gotten their names to send them a commendation. The unit was clean and well supplied. We had no neighbors or either side so we had lots of privacy. The common areas were clean and well maintained. I know some reviewers have complained about the... More"
"590",4,"I liked the hotel staff for quality of staff."
"591",5,"Good location convenient to drives through the vineyard districts and excellent downtown restaurants. Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable. Shawn and Shanirra are a great value to our staff and I am pleased they had the advise and information you needed. You are right either book direct or at Bestwestern.com for the best price. We will see you again the next time your in the area."
"592",5,"Bad: That I had to leave great place. Good: Everything very nice room food service"
"593",4,"We had a wonderful trip at New Orleans as we are invited by Tulane University School of Medicine. Me and my spouse were extremely busy with academic commitments. The hotel is very good and near to Tulane School of Medicine. Breakfast is good and service is very high quality. The room is descent, medium size with all the amenities. Bathroom is simply superb. Room service is also praiseworthy. Only draw back is its House Keeping team. One should not keep any valuables or important materials outside as during house keeping things may be missing. One should lock all the valuables in his or her suitcase before leaving the room and kept for house keeping. This issue was serious by nature and we have reported several times on this issue. Otherwise it is a lovely hotel with very friendly front office staffers.Thank you for sharing the details of your stay. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the comments. We do provide a safe in the room for valuabls, in this case I'm aware of the medications that were inadvertently thrown away, I'm glad we were able to retrieve them for you. We look forward to seeing you again soon.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager"
"594",5,"The hotel was very good,I didn't have any problems. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
"595",4,"Bad: Nothing (little far from strip). Good: Kind people, clean space and cheap price"
"596",5,"Clean room, very helpful staff. Had directions pre-printed to area malls, etc. Most hotels serve complimentary breakfast but these guys served dinner also. Real nice place."
"597",5,"Recently stayed for 2 weeks in the Paddock area of saratoga springs. Great location..just a short walk to the paddock pool and padfock grill...also 2 mins from either carousel or paddock bus stop.

I have to say that going out from the fantastic resort to... More"
"599",2,"Its old, worn out and a bit dingy. Centrally located amongst a number of good bars and places to eat is the only reason I stay here. At least the sheets are always clean."
"600",4,"Located right next to Highway 2 in superior , Rooms are nice with updated HVAC units through the wall. Water is good , Beds are well less than okay. In need of replacing .. rates are sub par for what your getting.. they lack technology ( reservations which is what im assuming happend to the previous person ) service is alright .. however if you are in a smoking room dont open your windows they assume you have the heat on all the time and bug you about it like crazy.

"601",4,"I had to travel to Florida during Spring Break/March Madness for business and I wasn't sure I'd find a hotel but I did! I always enjoy my stays at Best Westerns and this stay was great too. I wanted to take the bed home as it's much more comfortable than my own."
"602",5,"We loved the hotel and the staff. The concierges were especially helpful. It is in the best location for sightseeing and restaurants. One criticism - when I booked with your service, you told me a carriage ride and walking tour were included. The hotel staff said they never have included those extras. Hotels.com needs to straighten that out."
"603",4,"We stayed here one night, because it was the end of our family vacation, and we ended up staying too late to leave/drive home. So we got this place cause it was cheapest in the area, and ended up being almost better than the room we had just stayed in for a week. The beds and pillows were so nice and fluffy, the floors were new and nice not dirty. There was a micro, fridge, and coffemaker. The tv was a flat screen. The bathroom was newly redone and very nice. Was happy i didn't have to be scared."
"604",5,"Only complaint was the room got very hot during the night because the thermostat was not working properly. Have stayed at this location before and did not have any problem with heating or cooling."
"605",4,"WiFi turns off each 15 min requiring new log in. 2 broadcast channels didn't work, some cable channels scratchy, but HBO and NBC were loud and clear along with all the ESPN and FOX channels. Bed was nice, could have used some firmer pillows. Super friendly and polite staff that stands out. FREE car parking for guests! Local area, well it's a NYC area airport hotel. Still I'd rather use EWR over the others for accessibility. Enough said."
"606",5,"Bad: Bed wasn't awful but could have been better. Parking is a couple blocks away in a garage (I would consider this neutral - pretty much standard for Miami Beach). Good: Quaint with an art deco feel. I will definitely be back!"
"607",5,"Hotel is located in west Hollywood . We stayed here a night and I had a great experience . Staff was very helpful and the hotel was beautiful. We got a one bedroom suite with a balcony view overlooking the city. It was beautiful view both during the day and during the night. The rooftop was amazing. I totally recommend... More"
"608",5,"The location is great. The room had some very nice touches Bose wave radio, the ability to open the window a bit, nice views, marble bathroom with a TV built into the mirror, good selection of snacks and drinks for purchase. The room and hotel is spotless, staff very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend and will stay again."
"609",3,"This is the second time I've stayed at The Cove for various reunions at the academy. Each unit is owned privately and rented out as needed. There is an indoor pool and beachfront access with piers. All units have balconies and I think most are 2 bedroom. During this most recent stay, it appeared the unit had been renovated, but... More"

"616",5,"Stayed at a couple around the same area. This was the best."
"617",4,"a small hotel, beautiful rooms , great staff, just minutes away from Quincy Market. Subway stop in front of the hotel. second stop after airport.has a starbucks in the lobby and other places you can have breakfast are just minutes away."
"618",5,"After stopping over for one night in another city on the way to Springfield and being very disappointed in that hotel (Super 8), I was tempted to cancel my reservations here, but when we checked in, we were all pleasantly surprised and very satisfied with the rooms - very clean, helpful and polite staff, good hot/cold breakfast, etc. I had reserved two rooms (myself husband and in-laws). We checked in Tues and out on Sat - no problems at all. We would definitely stay at this hotel again."
"619",4,"Bad: Shower liner needs replacing. Upgrade of toilet tissue. Also, would be very nice to have Alittle something to pick up an eat, in the morning, in the lobby area. Good: Bed very comfy! Coffee in room Loved the delicious cookies you had in the lobby area, along with the wonderful fruited water!!!!! Our favorite!!!! That was just perfect in the late afternoon after coming back from Williamsburg!!"
"620",5,"The Modern is a great place to stay in Boise, especially for someone who values the small and personal. It's walking distance to downtown and a mere stroll to a great brewery and a few taprooms. The fantastic Big City Coffee is practically next door and it has it's own bar that offers some amazing drinks. A lovely place to... More"

"623",5,"I've stayed at several hotels in the area, but this is favorite. It is clean, spacious, comfy, and close to th casino. But their greatest asset is the woman checking you in. I wish I could remember her name. Super nice and friendly and helpful. I'm so glad I found this place. Note: website was showing sold out but we... More"
"624",5,"Great, clean place to stay. Needed to be near the airport. Breakfast was over priced. But I would still recommend this hotel. It was a little difficult to locate at night. Could use a street light and hotel sign at the corner. Almost ran over curb."
"625",4,"I chose this property as the site as the host hotel for my brother's wedding guests and rehearsal dinner. The rooms were fine and the staff was mostly attentive. On one of the mornings, housekeeping missed making the bed somehow. The breakfast is awful. If you ate looking for a good free breakfast this is not the place. The meeting... More"
"626",5,"Good: I was mistakenly booked the wrong date to extend my stay using Booking.com. However, the receptionist, Ms. Lynn, very helpful by giving a call to Booking.com and finally be able to change the date."
"627",3,"This is a new hotel right next door to the University of New Mexico. Very nice staff, clean and bright, with kitchenettes. No restaurant or bar but shuttle will take you shopping or out to eat. No safe in room, which is important to me. Lockbox available behind registration."
"628",1,"Room was clean, breakfast was OK and the desk clerks were friendly. Now for the bad: My daughter tried putting brown sugar on her oatmeal and it was solid like a rock in the shaker.The juice machine was covered with fruit flies and the lady tending to the food was rude when we accidentally dropped some food on the floor stating she would be the one cleaning it up later. The 3rd floor hall was like an ice box due to remodeling. The heater in the room did not work properly. The pool was closed for renovations.The vending machine was almost completely out of food. Thanks for a horrible experience. It will be a cold day in Hades before Holiday Inn gets my hard earned money again."
"629",4,"Bad: The room was right off the elevator so you could hear everyone coming off of it. Good: The bathroom was very nice. The shower has great water pressure and the shower head is adjustable."
"630",5,"This place is very nice and clean. The location can't be beat, it's within walking distance to everything in town. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We had a really enjoyable stay and will return again."
"631",4,"I stayed here twice last summer and it was well worth it. There are plenty of stores and restaurants near by, and the beach is within walking distance. The pool is small, but very nice and clean (which you don't always find). The rooms don't look like a palace, but they are reasonable as are the prices. The area is... More"

I have been... More"
"634",3,"Room clean, rate decent. Didn't try breakfast. Beds not so comfortable. Ok if you're looking for a place to sleep and not a vacation spot. We have stayed here several times over the past 10 years and the quality has improved."
"635",4,"Overall the stay was very good. The shuttle service was very helpful and the drivers were friendly and gave us good information on where to eat or have fun. The pool was relaxing and clean although the hot tub was way too hot. The pool has an adult time after 11:00pm but it is not monitored so the pool and hot tub had kids (both from and not from the hotel) in it at that time. Get to the pool early to get a seat as there are not many and they go fast. It was nice to use the bikes for a ride since they are free for the first 3 hours. I would return to the Hotel in the future."
"636",4,"Stayed there several times due to a courteous and helpful staff, great breakfast, comfortable beds, wonderful (and clean) swimming pool and easy as well as timely airport access."
"637",5,"Well situated near magic mile for shopping and walking distance from the loop. CTA station pretty close to hotel."
"638",5,"Bad: Nothing to really complain about. Good: Only 2 blocks from from Inner Harbor. Everything was in walking distance. Breakfast was great. Very clean. Front Desk people where very pleasant."
"639",2,"I was checked in by a young lady who did not welcome me and was talking to other staff while checking me in. She gave me a room key that did not work.

"641",5,"We had an amazing time and love it there. Quaint cottages, beautiful pool and a fun game room. The family who owns it is incredibly sweet. Overall I'd rate it a 10 if I could. The beds were comfy, everything was clean, the tables and outside chairs make it a great place to relax and enjoy the fresh air."
"642",5,"This is a nice LaQuinta hotel. We came back from Bearazona wildlife park after going there with our dogs Timmy and Peanut. They were so understanding about getting us a room as close to a door on the first floor as possible. The rooms are clean with a fridge and a microwave in it. We are booked in February again for our road trip back to Las Angeles."
"643",4,"Simple lobby, no luxury here. CLEAN and all the basics are here. We got a suite because we were a party of 3... so we had 2 large separate rooms... one with a fold-out sofa and kitchen (bar/microwave/fridg/coffee/sink)... the other with a big bath/jacuzzi, heated towel rack/separate glass shower and king bed.

"645",2,"Comfortable bed for the night. My first impression was quite good for the price. Then I opened the closet door and discovered the garbage from a previous guest (ancient pizza in box, used plates, used napkins) stacked inside. Looked like it had been there a long, long time. It's amazing how fast your impression of a place can change. Wish the person at the desk had been a little more concerned about it when I told her. I did not leave with a great impression of the place."
"646",5,"We have stayed at this hotel twice in the last year and we love it.

"651",2,"Bad: Rooms small, air conditioning don't work!!."

"653",5,"Outstanding hotel, location not as convenient as I remembered with respect to fast food restaurants for that quick bite to eat. Very quiet area (well, it is dead of winter), but just the same we enjoyed the peace and quiet."
"654",4,"I've stayed at this hotel twice both times in November. Perhaps it's just because it's a slow season in that area, both times I got a GREAT sleep. Peace and quiet and a clean room is all I ask. The hotel strikes me as a property that was redone (or built) in the 2000s. The linen and furnishing, wall coverings,... More"

"658",1,"The individual by the name of John who worked the front desk was very rude on May 17, 2016.I would never recommend or stay at this hotel. My sister ended up just leaving without staying after she paid her money. I am calling the manager as soon as possible."

"661",4,"The continental breakfast had a waffle maker - always a nice addition."
"662",5,"A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new, white-clad, 36-room property located steps from Duval Street, the main drag in Key West. Staff seem a bit over-taxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals, room service, taxis, and logistics. Service was excellent, starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo, who is helpful, not to mention easy on the eyes. Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents. Blue lighting predominates on the exterior, too. Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lap-style pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end. Careful - they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple. My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable, and was part of the new remodel/construction. You may want to request a newer room. The location cannot be beat. It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street. Through a side gate you step right onto Duval. Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days. Go right and there are more of the same, including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only 4 to 6 blocks away. I walked to the marina for several excursions, to the southernmost point and south beaches. The hotel has bikes available at no charge. I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and far-off marinas for some of my excursions. Overall, this property served me well. Its common spaces are chic and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and the people working there make things as easy as possible.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time and the amenities of our property! We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to our employees so that they know their hard work is appreciated. Please, come back and see us!"
"663",4,"I thought it a little pricey for the condition of the hotel, but overall not bad. Pool area was nice, bar area was nice."
"664",5,"Bad: Little bit boring breakfast..but is relative to yhe nightly rate. Good: Nice clean, good pool,great price 15mins to all attractions"

"673",4,"Bad: Dirty windows in the room dirty carpet in hallway and dirty door for service entrance 3 rd floor. Good: The gentleman at reception and the valets"
"674",5,"We stayed 1 night in a smoker room, we don't smoke but this was the only option I could select. The room was pretty dated but still seemed clean. Outaide stairs to get up to our room were a little rickety. Pool/game room area was very neat! Breakfast was good. Staff very polite and friendly. They even gave us a little bag with a few treats and bottle water when we arrived so that was nice too! Would stay there again."
"675",5,"Great, night sleep on nice, clean King size bed. Nice comfortable pillows! Room was large and very clean. Front desk staff was friendly. Free shuttle to/from National airport and to/from a nearby Metro station and complimentary, fresh breakfast buffet is a nice plus! Highly recommend this hotel."

Staff was very friendly and accommodating, helped me out when a scheduling mixup (my fault) could have led to serious difficulties. Breakfast was very good and they even had a 5:00pm snack time with hot food, popcorn, etc.... More"
"677",4,"This is a well equipped, stylish hotel near the airport. Recommended!"
"678",3,"The hotel advertises a free breakfast but I went down to the breakfast area at 9:00 a.m. and everything was gone except for boxes of cereal and some not-very-nice looking fruit. The food area was also a mess. The rooms are not in very good repair - some mold damage along the ceiling in both the bedroom and bathroom. They have changed to cotton bed covers that can be washed rather than polyester so that's an improvement. Overall this hotel is fair."
"679",4,"we stayed in Hudson to visit family. We had a good stay, loved the free breakfast in the morning. would have loved to see a hot tub in the pool area. would stay here again. would recommend to family and friends"
"680",5,"This hotel is the best we have stayed at in Baton Rouge -- Large rooms, very nice kitchen with granite and stainless appliances, clean bathroom with plenty of towels and toiletries, very comfortable bed with high quality bedding. The breakfast room was lovely with several choices for the hot breakfast, and the lobby was beautiful and inviting -- fireplace, comfortable leather furniture, fresh flower arrangements. Everything was nice, including the landscaping. We were impressed."
"681",4,"Great hotel for price. Large rooms with good views. We had small toddler and he had room to play and climb--very spacious! Room was very clean and hotel staff was great. Nice breakfast (eggs, waffles, French toast, fruit, yogurt). Everything was great, but the pool. Pool was extremely small and was greenish in color. I was surprised at how small it was. Other than that, great hotel for the money and it is close to the inner harbor and National Aquarium. Don't valet, as they charge 42 per day. Garage behind hotel was 3 on the weekend and we parked there 20+ hours. During week it was only 14 to park overnight."
"682",5,"Nothing bad to say about this hotel. Great location, great service, great staff, great rooms! And they take pets! The front desk staff was very helpful and so courteous. The last time we were in Jackson we stayed at the Marriott Courtyard next door and their service and the attitude of their front desk staff was so terrible we vowed... More"
"683",2,"The lobby was nice, but the room was small and the bathroom was dirty. The room didn't have a small refrigerator which I was shocked to find. So much for my leftovers. The woman when we checked in and out was standoffish. Good things about the hotel: the bed was comfortable and the location was nice. After arriving home I discovered a charge on my card from the hotel. I didn't do anything to incur a charge so I called them to ask about it. The woman on the phone was unbelievably rude! She transferred me to a voicemail where one of my options was to press zero for personal assistance (which is why I called). I was rerouted to the same woman who now seemed incredibly frustrated by me and insisted I leave a voicemail. She transfers me again. I just thought she could have been more polite and accommodating. I did get the issue sorted out, but the attitude of the woman on my initial phone call left a bad taste in my mouth. The location of this hotel is great, but the hotel itself isn't nice enough for the rate and the staff could use a lesson in manners and service."
"684",4,"Everything was great, cabin and views are amazing. Fishing is second to none for trout. Master bedroom is great but the bed is not, had to move to the couch where i slept like a baby. With a new bed this would be 5 stars. Also, the owners were great!"
"685",5,"I stayed here during my trip to DC on the Memorial Day weekend. I found this hotel very clean and comfortable. It is close to the Metro Station (5-10 min walk or 5 by cab) which is a big plus. Good neighbourhood. No Room service but lots of reasonable options to order from. Super nice room with kitchen. Didnt use much of the hotel services but found this place worth the money I spent. I didnt face any issues during my stay and would recommend this to my friends."
"686",5,"Staff were very helpful and the motel is very nice. Modern, quality gym, good breakfast and the staff work hard to please customers. I will stay here again this was a pleasant experience. The manager made sure we had what we needed for getting laundry done in the middle of our vacation. You could tell he was involved with the... More"
"687",2,"Terribly managed hotel. Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in a while. Arrived late in the evening and found a que of guests trying to check in. One family with four kids apparently had booked two rooms via Expedia only to be told they had only one room with a king bed available. The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do - listening to their phone conversation with (apparently) their manager, it seems they had a number of free rooms - but those had not been cleaned and where dirty. They also made everyone pay a 200 security fee - which upset several of the guests trying to check in. My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem. However, I needed to go three times up to my room on the 6th floor because the key card did not work - they then switched me to another room. The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in. Since they could give me another room, why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy. Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant. To sum it up, I do not recommend this hotel. Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead - eventhoug it is a little more expensive. Other folks in my group stayed there - I should have done the same."
"688",5,"We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!"
"689",5,"Bad: Rooms are a little compact, but that had little impact on our stay!. Good: Location was excellent and the price was very reasonable compared to other properties. Staff were all amazing."
"690",5,"This hotel met all my standards: First foremost, it was clean. Secondly, the bed was comfortable. Shower looked new and had some nice features, in addition to having a modern shower head. Along that line, the room entire hotel was modern/refurbished. Good wifi reception."
"691",5,"Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future"
"692",5,"We attained this hotel at a great price. The room was comfortable and conveniently located. The gym and pool was a definate plus. We would choose this hotel again."
"693",5,"Outstanding hotel. Stayed in a huge suite at a good price. Hotel and room were very clean. Room was quiet, no noise from the hall or other rooms. Excellent service: valet, bellman, room service, front desk. Front desk had two cribs in our room before our arrival. At most hotels, we have to call two or three times after arrival to get cribs delivered, no matter how often we have requested them ahead of time. Only issue: pool was not heated as much as needed."
"694",4,"Having a drink or a meal at the lodge is the best way to take in the view of the ocean and the 18th hole. If you know you are going i would recommend making a reservation for a meal otherwise be prepared to wait (especially if it is a nice day). Food was great and the staff were all... More"
"695",4,"I generally stay here when I go home for a visit. It is in my budget and well maintained. It is in a good location."
"696",4,"Very friendly staff, but most of them have no knowledge about the area. Expensive for the area"
"697",5,"Clean well-furnished room with good amenities including minifridge and microwave. Fitness room with up-to-date equipment. Nice indoor pool with whirlpool hot tub. I was pleased to see there was a lift to help someone with mobility problems get into/ out of pool. Staff was pleasant and professional."
"698",5,"We were glad to find a great place for a great price. We even got out for a walk after our flight and found the area to be safe and easy to walk around. The people were nice and the breakfast decent. We'd definitely recommend it."
"699",5,"This hotel has an amazing staff from the GM, to the front desk, down to the breakfast and cleaning crew. My king suite was spacious and very clean!! The evening meals combined with ice cream socials are amazing. Reserved parking spots for IHG Platinum and gold members is a plus. The free hot breakfast has everything you want plus yogurt,...

"700",5,"The folks at the concierge desk are very helpful in directing you on where to go, what to do, and how to get there. The hotel is within walking distance of Chinatown. The tub in the junior suite is large and oh-so-nice after spending the day shopping or walking the wharf!"
"701",3,"This has always been a great hotel, and one I have given good reviews to before. But this past weekend we stayed there, and the bedding was crap. Not at all comfortable. this room had one of those sleep number beds, where theoretically each side can adjust to the desired firmness. We couldn't get it to do anything, and the... More"
"702",5,"This hotel is super!!The staff is friendly, and very competent. The room was spacious, and clean, and the bed comfortable. The location is good, and there is a restaurant around the corner. Very quiet."
"703",4,"No frills room, clean. Not high priced. The real seller for us was the hot dinner with free drinks. Then a hot breakfast also free. Food was good especially for dinner. We would definitely stay here again."
"704",5,"From the moment we checked in to our last minute there, the service was world class. The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY. What a wonderful 5 star experience!Dear Dan B,We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.Thank you for your time and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. We will share your kind words with our staff, and we are so grateful for your support!We look forward to welcoming you back to New York soon! Kindly, Maria Wittorp-DejongeChef Concierge"
"705",5,"I stay here 3-4 times per year. Consistent service, cleanliness, bed comfort, etc. If you haven't stayed in a microtel hotel it's nothing fancy but this location is well kept."
"706",5,"Very cool place to stay. Great location. The breakfast in picnic baskets was a great touch. Lots to do! Bikes provided for getting around the area. Rooftop bar and nightly wine tastings. Nice rooftop pool. The employees were super friendly. We will be back."
"707",4,"I stayed at this hotel for four nights and enjoyed my stay. The location was convienantly located next to I-95 (although somewhat hard to find the first time due to the congestion of the area) and a 5-10 minute drive to the Franconia-Springfield metro station. The free breakfast included all you can eat scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, and waffles along with the usual fare, a nice touch. The breakfast room was kept clean and well stocked by an ever present staff member. The staff was about the friendliest and most helpful of any hotel I've stayed in. My only complaints would be a weak air conditioner and noisiness in the early evening due to the large number of children staying there. Quiet overnight, though."
"708",4,"We stayed at Best Western in DeRidder, LA as a group with a baseball team for a tournament. It was a nice place to stay and convenient location to where we needed to go. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff was really helpful and nice."
"709",2,"My room was clean but everything was run down. The carpet was ripped and coming up near the door and the bedding looked like it came from the 70s. The only good thing was the new flat screen TV. My stay was ok but I would not stay there again the area isn't all that great and I did not feel safe going to my car."
"710",4,"My extended weekend stay at this hotel was very enjoyable. I have no complaints. I would strongly advise, though, that guests make use of the shuttle service to and from the subway station. However, the immediate environs of the hotel are quite pleasing. There is an international supermarket in the plaza across the street. Quite a convenience."
"711",4,"A trip to Oklahoma City wasnt really part of my vacation itinerary, but being from the neighboring state me and two of my friends decided to check out OKC anyway. For some reason we zeroed in on Bricktown Hotel, but boy, did we make the right decision! It was just awesome. We were kind of budget travelers, but we got more than we expected. The friendly staff and the great room facilities really impressed us, as did the great summer weather that greeted us whenever we went exploring the city. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast too. OKC really made us feel welcome, and Bricktown was just rocking. But were it not for Bricktown Hotel, I wonder whether wed have had such a marvelous time."
"712",1,"The girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Salem mass for Halloween and upon checking Expedia found this hotel listed as 103 for 2 nights with only 1 room left available. Shocked at this amazing deal we booked immediately. When we arrived and tried to check in we were informed that we owed 230. I was outraged and demanded to talk to a manager who wasn't there. We ended up settling to stay only 1 night which was over 100 and then make our way to Salem the next morning after having breakfast and find somewhere else. We wake up the next morning to find out there isn't even a free breakfast! Very unhappy with this stay and will never go to this hotel or the franchise again!!!!"
"713",4,"I have stayed many times at this hotel over the past 20+ years and prefer it to the others I have tried in New Orleans. I have also recommended it to friends and colleagues who were very pleased. It is somewhat pricey but you will not be disappointed."
"714",4,"No problems. I felt safe, watched tv, and slept comfortably well. Improvement clogged tub, Bfast not enough for number of guests"
"715",3,"Bad: The rooms are tiny, but expensive. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They seemed bored and not so welcoming to visitors. They didnt refill the coffee thermos for breakfast and didnt care to either. It was awkward. Good: The place is clean and centrally located. I enjoyed the music playing in the room upon arrival. Its been updated although its an old building."
"716",5,"Bad: We had a bit of a problem with our keycards but the staff was so friendly and helpful. Good: The staff was very pleasant. The room was very clean and comfortable and the shower was AMAZING! Great location also. Walking distance to Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue. Would definitely stay here again!"
"717",3,"This was a stop over on a cross country driving trip. We had high hopes for this place and were hoping we would like it enough to stay two nights. One night was more than enough.

"736",4,"Pets are allowed. You do not know which rooms they allow Pets. I was awakened my first evening four times by two pit bulls barking beside me. Staff moved us to different room next day. Valet parking is too expensive. Rib Room prices are also too high. Rooms with a balcony are the way to go. Good Location for Hotel."
"737",5,"We came for a weekend getaway with friends and our third time at the Aria. We have tried other properties and just feel the Aria is the best-- perfect location, incredible restaurants, wonderful pool and fitness areas... And don't forget the smell when you enter the lobby-- I'm pretty convinced that's what Heaven smells like!"
"738",4,"Clean quiet room with comfortable bed. Free breakfast and internet. Good view of the lake, we were even treated to a firework show on the night of stay. Lots of parking and very convenient from the freeway. I have no hesitation visiting this Best Western in the future. Staff was very friendly and helpful."

Maybe it was because we had the special price rate, but I expected better from a Hilton brand hotel... Other than that, the room was nice, average size and the staff was very friendly. When they saw us come in (we were still in tux and wedding gown), they offered congratulations and of course, the cookies were excellent!!!"

"743",5,"My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel."

"778",4,"We stayed in a small queen room for 2 nights. The room is small, but comfortable. I will say, however, that the bed is on the hard side and not the most comfortable. The sheets have a papery feel to them as well. But the pillows are fluffy. Not the typical hotel bed where you feel like you're sleeping on clouds, but it does the trick, I suppose. Still, all in all, the staff is friendly and the location is really convenient if you'll be spending time downtown. The room is quiet and the wifi is free. It's also affordable. Based on that, I recommend it.Dear Ann C,Thank you for your recommendation! We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback about your recent experience.We look forward to welcoming you back in the future."

"792",5,"Our holiday stay at the NOPSI was PERFECT! The hotel and the architecture are spectacular. The staff, from housekeeping to management, was professional, efficient, polite and friendly. The service was just as one would expect from a luxury hotel. I can't say enough about the bartenders at all 3 bars. They were knowledgeable mixologists, friendly and efficient. The view from the rooftop bar is grand and so is the atmosphere. The lobby bar is beautiful and the live music in the evenings was a wonderful treat. Room service was delivered quicker than anticipated and was delicious! Our breakfasts were first class! The 3 egg omelet Pontchartrain, Porchetta Hash and Eggs, Pecan Belgian Waffles and 1/2 Ruby Grapefruit Brle were the best room service meals I believe my husband and I have ever had for breakfast. The room service wait staff was polite and friendly. Although we did not dine at Public Service during this stay, we have in the past and found the food and service to be exemplary. Christmas morning we were greeted with a stocking hanging on our door. The stocking was filled with fresh fruit, candy and baked goods. What a wonderful surprise! The accommodations were beautiful and comfortable. My husband is generally very uncomfortable sleeping in hotel beds and lounging on hotel furniture, but he was very comfortable during our stay at the NOPSI. He was so pleased, that he has already booked the hotel for a return business trip in the near future. Love this beautiful hotel in my favorite city! Can't wait to return.Sharon, Thank you for sharing your wonderful review on TripAdvisor. I am thrilled that you enjoyed a little lagniappe on Christmas morning as well as phenomenal service throughout your stay. It is an honor to be your hotel of choice in New Orleans. Our team looks forward to welcoming you again on your next visit. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"

"795",5,"Loved this place! If you are looking for a chain hotel, THIS IS NOT for you. If you are looking for different, unique, friendly, fun...then this is it.

Although there are internal hotel noises every once and a while..it was by no means disturbing or loud. Location was awesome! We mainly hung out on Decatour street/Jackson square/French market..but even bourbon street was a short walk. Hotel staff is very knowledgeable about places to eat and things to do.

"855",1,"A nice clean casino with affordable restaurants. However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best.

We asked for silverware so that we could eat our room service. Never brought it. We ended up eating with coffee stirrers in the room.

The customer service was variable and I was disappointed with their lack of assistance when we encountered an issue with our air conditioner. Parking is free, wifi is decent and free, there is also a free breakfast which was nice. Best of all, no resort fee. Dear netgeek,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so that we can better serve our guests.

I selected Sonesta because it was close hey 97 and a short drive to Arumdal Mills Mall. I've been previously disappointed choosing familiar brand name hotels in Baltimore. I've learned that brands don't guarantee quality. I wasn't familiar with Sonesta but I figured the hotel had to be good because of the location. I didn't have a clue. Out of all the hotels I've visited within the past 2 years, this is the best. I could LIVE there. EVERYTHING was excellent."

Across the street there is the space needle, the Chihuly gardens, the EMP, and the Seattle center, a lovely park with an amazing playground. Breakfast in hotel was complimentary and was good considering a budget hotel (3 star). The courteous and always willing to serve staff and Chef played a big role. Free 24 hr shuttle within a mile of hotel but sometime wait time is high if you are in downtown markets.Well worth it in Seattle!Devendra G,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

"950",3,"Price was a little bit deceptive...when I booked the room, it stated that breakfast is included. However, it is not included in the quoted rate...you are charged an additional 9.95 per day (mandatory) for 2 bottles of water and the breakfast, plus use of the fitness center. Since this is mandatory, it should be included in the overall rate. The room was fine but there was a funny, fishy smell in the hallway on my floor. Not sure what that was all about."

"957",1,"I was kicked out just 2 hours into my stay even though I paid full price thanks to the front desk people who gave out my information to an unknown third party. my safety and security was violated. I also saw cockroaches and bugs crawling all over the place. it was nasty."
"958",1,"This hotel is like living in a construct zone. The hallways are not air cond and missing the baseboards. The room had chips in every wall. The bath tub has millldew stains around the edge. Hotel doors are not lock and in fact some could not be locked because the operating bar was missing. When I told them about the unsecured doors, the reply was that they had cameras. Breakfast was a joke - kids cerials, mini bagels and cupcakes with terrible coffee. Our flight was delayed a day and we checked out and used another hotel. Best description is it is run on the cheap. Shame on Ramada."
"959",5,"This Hyatt is a great place. Clean, quiet, friendly staff, nice bar, great happy hour, well located and responsive to your needs. We will stay here again without a doubt. It was a little noisy from other patrons slamming fire doors. That was not the hotel's fault. That came from people with no social graces."

The customer service I received from the associates named Rufus Tonie were exemplary and at the highest standards of customer satisfaction. Everyone on staff went over above to make sure my stay was an excellent experience. I will definitely be staying at this location again."

The staff were very friendly and the accommodation was also clean with good facilities. Before going, I was concerned about some of the reviews but personally, I encountered no problems."

"970",4,"Hotel was very clean, nice amenities, friendly staff. However, the transportation company they partner with are less than honest. They sell you a round trip transportation to cruise port for 60, and then the hotel tries to charge an additional 32 to go to the port."
"971",2,"Only staff that was friendly was the evening desk person. The Red Lion Inn Suites Manager McMinnville, OR is very VERY rude! Crystal!! We attempted to cancel our second night due to changes in our travel plans. A few hours after we checked in we were told checking out a day early was no problem so we made a reservation at another hotel a few hours further south in OR. When we went to check out we were told by Crystal that we would not be getting a refund for the second night because we were a pre-pay. She insisted that it was Expedia that would not permit the refund. She also said it was hotel policy that since it was a prepay the second night could not be refunded!! I called Expedia, and they tried to get the Crystal to release us from the second night and they were told NO, and Expedia had no choice but to honor the hotel policy. So now we had two hotel reservations. Fortunately Expedia was able to cancel the reservation we had made at the other hotel (without penalty). We later checked the hotel policy on-line and it did not say anything regarding no refund for cancelling a second night, only first night or no shows!! We brought this to Crystals attention, and she just said hmmm, Ill check into that. No apologies, no managerial flexibility in resolving our customer dissatisfaction, and she talked to us as if we were children. Red Lion did not care about our needs, only about selling out the hotel!! We doubt we will never stay at another Red Lion."
"972",3,"Room was clean. Hotel located at a busy intersection. Windows were so outdated, every outside noise was heard. A lot of traffic noise. AC unit kept coming on snd off so frequently, it kept us awake. Initially when we arrived, no one was at the desk. Had to wait several minutes before being helped."

"976",5,"We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

"980",5,"Staff was courteous and room was very clean. Watch out for the 1.50 insurance charge for the room safe. Never seen that one before and did not like that I had to request at checkout that it be removed rather than at check in."
"981",4,"Bad: No wifi in the rooms in 2017. Good: Great location! Friendly staff and you can buy your breakfast in the casino. There is no free Wifi in the rooms, but you can enjoy free Wifi in the lobby. Room was spacious enough and linnens were clean. Room looked like it was recently updated and we enjoyed our stay."

"985",3,"Having stayed at several Embassy Suites, this one in Crystal City does not meet the expectation of Embassy Suite standards. The hotel's only restaurant does not have much to offer as compared to the 3 restaurants of Marriott Hotel which is next door. The front desk people needs further training in Customer Service. Granted that they may be college students, their customer service needs to focus on the needs of the Customer such as inquiring if there are any questions we may have regarding the town i.e, restaurants, shopping, metro transit. The only thing that is great w/ this place is their full breakfast."

"991",3,"The front desk staff was very pleasant and and helpful. We enjoyed the hot breakfast, internet worked well, and the room was clean but a little on the small size with the cramped sink area. It would be nice if maintenance adjusted the door checks as we grew quite annoyed with other guests that kept letting their doors slam."

It was an overall great place to stay we'd definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, clean place to stay that doesn't cost too much."
"995",5,"This is the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in. A bit out of the way, but well worth the hunt. Everything was spotless, the tv was great.

"1004",4,"Our room was comfortable and clean. The only drawback that we found was that we could not access the internet and the attendant did not know how to remedy the problem. The breakfast was excellent with several options to choose from."

"1007",5,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in April, coming from Victoria on the Clipper. The hotel was very conveniently located, just four blocks from the ferry terminal. We were met by Lee, who was very courteous, and very helpful with suggestions and directions for sightseeing and restaurants. The room was very nice, and very quiet. We enjoyed happy hour in the lobby, and we had one dinner in the restaurant downstairs. The ambience is very retro. The front-desk and cleaning staff were wonderful. We could do all of the sightseeing we wanted on foot. Chihuly Garden and Glass was a highlight. Highly recommended.Dear Guest,Thank you for this fantastic review! Our location really is ideal for 'on-foot' sightseeing of the Chihuly Museum/Space Needle as well the Pike Place Market. Nice when we are perfectly placed in the middle of these two iconic spots! Your kudos for Lee are so appreciated as well. We pride ourselves on making guests feel as if they've traveled to a home away from home, so it would be our greatest honor to welcome you back as our guests again in the future. Please feel free to reach out to me directly when you consider your next trip to Seattle :)Best Regards,David Bayley"

"1014",3,"Parking fee is too expensive. 29 dollars per night is a lot. Hotel should review and consider to low that price for customers. Personnel that is taking care of the cars (valet pkng) think that are in the racing driving the cars too fast."

"1017",5,"I stay at this hotel for 2 weeks. And the staff was always very up beat and friendly and always ready to help. The Hotel was clean inside and out. There was always fresh cookie at the front desk along with a smile on the stuff person no matter who the person was behind the counter."
"1018",5,"The staff were extremely friendly. Randall was very informative and helpful. The location is great, across the street from the Santa Monica pier. The room was quiet. The walls between bathroom and bedroom were see-thru glass. But there is a really cool privacy shade the lowers. It was clean and modern looking."
"1019",4,"Ok, their computers were down when I checked in. The wait to check in was too long AND the person behind the desk allowed another guest to deliberately cut in front of me and when questioned I was given an explanation of 'I don't know'. Then when I checked in, I was given the wrong room because someone was already in it. When I went back to lobby, there was another long wait because apparently other guests were given the wrong room also. Also, the card I checked in with for incidentals was charged for the stay, even though, I've already paid through hotels.com. I am aware that circumstances arise that are sometimes out of their control and I believe the the situation was handled to the best of their ability. I was given free items from the lobby fridge for the rude guests that cut in front of me AND my room was upgraded for free because I was initially given the wrong room. Lastly, I was completely reimbursed for them charging twice on my card. The situations were handled efficiently and the staff was accommodating to my concerns, questions and needs."
"1020",4,"This little hotel lived up to my expectations of a JDV hotel (I've stayed at Shoreline previously and loved it)!

In regards to location,... More"
"1021",4,"My first impression was that the lobby was full of pimps and hookers! The hotel was very nice, very clean but the guys standing by the door asking if they could bum a cigarette as I checked in with my 3 small sons skeeved me out a little bit. The room was clean, beds comfortable, towels fluffy, we checked in at 11.30pm and were out by 9am so it was a place to sleep and nothing else."

We stayed there only because our wedding reception was next door. Never again. So very disappointed. Don't let the lobby fool you. The only positive thing is the location."

"1027",4,"Nice hotel, great location, easy access to freeway. Pretty tropical landscaping, really nice pool fitness area. Front desk staff, friendly. Beds comfy, clean, fridge, table. Only issue seemed to be a funny smell that came and went the AC, took long for room to cool the lower the temp, unit would make a loud noise. Not sure if smell coming from the actual unit."
"1028",5,"I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

"1054",5,"Bad: I didn't appreciate the attitude of a few of the female employees in regards to the nightclub. I also would prefer a little more variety in the DJ's music choice. It seemed like ALL techno versions and sometimes we just want to hear the ACTUAL songs mixed. Other than that, I loved the property. Good: I loved the decor. Everything about the hotel from the lobby to the room was fantastic. The wood floors, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the shower overlooking the bedroom... PHENOMENAL! I loved the modern, but still comfortable feel. All employees I came in contact with had fantastic customer service skills with the exception of a few in the nightclub. Overall, this property is definitely on my list of Chicago properties as we visit often. Next time we will try out the spa as we didn't get a chance this visit."

"1065",1,"We got to the hotel about an hour or two early and asked if we could check in early and the receptionist said no, not until check in time. Understood so me and my friend grabbed food. We got back to the hotel and checked in. We walked into our first room and it was a disaster. There were holes in the bed sheets and they had a rank smelled. We went back to the front desk and changed our room. In the second room, the bed sheets had black stains and rips in them. So I went back to the front desk and changed again. The third room - one of the beds had holes and rips in the bed sheets. I went back to the front desk and expressed my frustration. She said she would have a house maid change the bed sheets. The next morning when we went to shower there was only 1 bath towel in the shower. We called the front desk and they said they would have towels to our room quickly. About 30-40 mins later, a hotel maid comes to our door and hands us a small face/hand towel saying all the other towels are getting washed right now. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had."

The woman at the front desk was extremely nice, the room was very clean, and the beds were super comfy. Bonus, they are pet friendly, and it can be hard to find a place that will take 2 dogs. I would definitely stay here again."
"1072",4,"My stay was good. I recommended the hotel to a friend because we were vacationing together. Her room had a strong smell and we were told it was coming from the pipes under the kitchenette sink. After complaining she was moved. She was offered several other rooms but they were dirty. The carpet and bathrooms look horrible. After she was shown several, (about 10 rooms) she settle on the cleanest she could find. I know you're a franchise, but when you using the Marriott name the hotel should be cleaner. Need another toaster. Only one toaster for the entire hotel. My eggs were cold before my bagel/bread was toasted. I was my second time there. I would stay there again. Hope I will never have the same problems as my girlfriend."

I never heard another person while in the room and virtually no street noise. Rooms are stylish and the beds are very comfortable. It has a mini kitchenette so if you there for a period of time it would be great. My only complaint is that the clocks in the room were still on Pacific Standard Time, not Daylight Savings. I did not notice this until the morning and was late for an appointment. I tried to change the clock but was not clear on the clock how to change the time. When I checked out I notified the desk that they should check the clocks in the rooms.David B,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. Thank you for the feedback regarding the clock in your suite.

"1097",5,"Overall this is a great property. The lobby, restaurant, and hotel rooms are really well done. Lots of nice touches with great designs. Tons of character here. We stayed in a double queen room which we thought had plenty of space. The gym is located between two floors and has a Peloton bike and the hotel provides the shoes. As a cycling, I thought this was awesome. I already had a Peloton login. The music in the gym, however, was too loud and we called to have it turned down and the staff couldn't figure out how to do it. The staff were all friendly and courteous - bellhops, front desk staff and concierge all included. Location very convenient to a number of places downtown. Beds and pillows were comfortable. TVs changed channels without the annoying 1 second delay at most other hotels. There's some construction going on at the property next door to be aware of, but it's New York and good luck finding somewhere without construction. Definitely recommend.Dear chitripguy, Thank you very much for your detailed and wonderful review. I am so glad you enjoyed our property from our comfortable rooms and the gym. We pride ourselves in service and i'm very happy to read you've enjoyed your stay. Hopefully we get to welcome you back again in the future!Warmest Regards, Nick HaferGeneral Manager"

I listened to numerous complaints from other guests while I waited in line to complain. The front desk gentleman was indifferent to the complaints and not much was resolved. I was in town for business and have never stayed in a worse down town 'hotel and conference center' in the hundreds of cities I've traveled to."

"1122",4,"When booking in this area we looked at both Sonoma and Napa. Sonoma is generally more expensive so we picked Napa, they are very close. We were glad that we picked Napa, it is a pretty and very manageable town and this hotel was very good. I thought that it might be a bit far out but it is not. Napa is very small and it is only a few minutes to drive to the central area where there are lots of great restaurants and shops. My husband walked it in the mornings. There are much pricier hotels than this one further out from the town centre.The room that we had was freshly reno'd and was large, clean and had a comfortable bed with nice linens. The only thing that we found a bit strange is what they call a balcony... it is an enclosure with a hole cut in it. We had a room looking out over the pool, but you can't see anything sitting on the balcony.The staff were very helpful and gave us great advice and suggestions each morning before we set out. The breakfast is at Denny's so you can get a big breakfast or get a something smaller and take the 5 credit.The pool and hot tub were small but nice at the end of the day. Would recommend this hotel.We are glad you had a Great Stay. Come back and stay with us on your next visit to Napa."

We never got it. There is no tissue (Kleenex) and don't expect complimentary shampoo and conditioner. In the morning when we checked out, the coffee pots were still empty. Having said all that, the room was clean and bed was pretty comfortable. Bathroom was clean and shower was hot so if that's what you are looking for, you will be satisfied."
"1132",5,"this is a fantastic hotel, i think it is a hidden gem located in the arts district of Phoenix. It is a fairly new hotel, very different, in a good way, from your typical hotel. The grounds are spotless, plenty of fun places to eat all within walking distance. I would not say it is within walking distance in the middle of summer in Phoenix to Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena. But the light rail has a stop right in front of the hotel and with your game ticket it is a free ride or for 4 bucks per person you can ride the light rail anywhere all day. Valet parking, only option, is 25 per day but they were great. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are the best part, very industrial but super cool. Concrete floors with plenty of area rugs.Neat shower and here would be the only complaints. The room is very open, the bath room only has frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room. Light from the bath room floods the rest of the room, especially on night runs to the bathroom. And has at least one other has said, you hear ALL noises coming from the bathroom which can be embaressing. We were in room 709, top floor king room with balcony and had an inflatable bed which I slept on (25 per night) It was a south facing room and had a great view of the city. 100 percent recommend this hotel, plenty of art all around.

The front desk employee quickly changed our room and apologized immediately. Breakfast is from 630-10 and it's a great spread. The chef comes out to ask how everyone is doing and ensures the sterno and food supplies are fully stocked. Hot food, cereals, muffins,bagels,yogurt,fruit,pancake maker,burrito bar you name it they had it. Didn't feel rushed at all. We were 15 away from the city area and it's close to the highway which was convienient. Room was good but walls need to be insulated you can hear everything in the next room. Housekeeping was good. Pool wasn't open but that wasn't a major issue for us. Plenty of parking. Overall good stay we would come back."

To call this establishment a resort is simply untrue. No laundry facilities available. No exhaust fan in bathroom. A limit as to how cool the air-con could be set.

The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has.

"1171",5,"I continue to find Hampton Inn the best choice for a chain hotel in the moderate price range. This hotel is no exception to the standard I have come to expect -- immaculate bathrooms, comfortable beds and a hearty, basic breakfast."
"1172",4,"Check in was easy. Room was clean except that it appeared that the toilet was not flushed. All free coffee, bottled water, and bath essentials were fully stocked with clean linens and sheets. WiFi worked great."
"1173",1,"Filthy, outdated, noisy neighbours, but this was not the worst. We were nearly eaten by the bed bugs, more agressive than Denali bears. I would not reccomend this hole even to my worst enemy. Next day we needed medical help."

"1182",4,"Bad: I wasn't in love with the location, but it's on a main road with a bunch of similar places. Also, the payment situation was a little annoying, and I wish the chairs outside looked a little cleaner. Although, it rains a lot so I imagine the upkeep is difficult. Good: I liked how clean and spacious the suite was. It was super cute. The staff was friendly and it was an easy walk to the beach."
"1183",4,"Cant beat the location of this hotel. Its a block away from Bourbon street and minutes away from Jackson Square and other attractions. Plenty of restaurants near by. Staff was extremely pleasant. The rooms were nice and clean. No complaints overall. Booked the hotel through a package deal and got a great deal."
"1184",4,"Needed a bed that was supportive not lumpy. Too much constru tion noise outside. Need to go around building not to have to climb steps to get to room."
"1185",5,"Great place to stay in the keys at an affordable price without sacrificing quality. Location: not on the beach but within driving/ biking distance to downtown and quiet. On site is a biking company to rent bikes or scooters from definitely recommend. Their kiosk is located next to the pool bar.Room: clean room, clean bedding/sheets, bed was medium comfort but we slept fine Pool: beautiful and big it wasn't crowded at all so you could enjoy it an any time. Lounge chairs were comfortable and cabanas were nice on a first come first serve basis. The pool bar was very nice with a variety of drinks. I wouldn't recommend the pool food with the exception of the wings and fries which were really good. Try some of the local beers on tap my favorite was the Crazy Lady very smooth. Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel.

"1194",2,"This was/is my second time staying at this hotel and I will probably never stay again. It was a Residence Inn but I guess the owners opted out of the franchise(or got kicked out) We stayed here about 4 years ago for my anniversary, I guess under different management/owners, we had a lovely stay, nice room, extremely comfortable bed, complimentary... More"
"1195",3,"The decor of this hotel needs to updated as it was a little tired and outdated but we had a clean room and bathroom and a comfortable bed and in the end we don't ask for more than that. The location put us in close proximity to the areas we wanted to visit."
"1196",5,"The Central Loop Hotel was in a super convenient location for walking to the Art Institute, restaurants, and shopping on State Street. I arrived by train, and it was just a couple of blocks walk to the hotel. The manager and front desk staff were very helpful and nice. The room was pretty basic, but clean and neat. Felt safe and secure. The only downside was the hotel practice of placing a deposit on my credit card for any incidental charges. I really don't like that practice. I noticed that I was not the only one, another hotel guest was complaining about it at the front counter while I was there. My hotel charges were paid in advance as a birthday gift from a family member, so I thought I was all taken care of, and then found out that I had to give them my credit card just in case there were any charges in addition. Of course there weren't any additional charges when I checked out. I just don't like having to do something like this."
"1197",5,"Good: Lovely room and bathroom. The lady on reception was very helpful and friendly. We would stay here again."

"1200",5,"I came in late after a long drive from Vegas ending in a whole lot of highway exits and concentration to get to Napa! I was greeted by a friendly night staff who was expecting me, and (not sure of his name) made me feel more relaxed immediately. I even got a little welcome pack with a snack and water. That was much appreciated!Breakfast was not included, fruit and granola bars were out in the lobby. A hotel discount was offered at the friendly Denny's next door. My room was quiet and all 3 of the morning staff were incredibly helpful the next morning helping me map out my day of driving, and helping me choose and book my next hotels. The hotel is a convienent location, not too far off the main highway. Near all services and malls if needed.We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and look foward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley!"

"1205",5,"Pricey, but that may have had more to do with the Spilleto festival that was going on while we were there. Excellent service and great location... Would definitely stay again if I return."
"1206",5,"The room was small quite clean the staff very helpful. I would stay here again as the location is wonderful, the price is reasonable and room adequate. I don't spend much time in a hotel room so the lack of space was not a problem."
"1207",5,"I was very pleased with my stay. My only compliant was that the waffle batter was extremely watery. Other then that, breakfast was really good.

"1209",4,"Great place to stay while doing the Charleston tourist attractions. Much cheaper than staying downtown, and the shuttle bus takes you into the city from a stop just outside the hotel, so no parking charges.Some maintenance issues with the room which were not all fixed during our stay. Internet was slow but free. Breakfast was the usual HIE fare.Staff were all keen to help, but the hotel is probably feeling its age."
"1210",5,"While not directly on the river walk, this hotel provides a driver named Joe that really enjoys his job of driving people to the river walk and other downtown locations. They also have a reception most night with snacks, beer, wine. Fantastic experience. You can tell this hotel is run by people that want to do a great job!"
"1211",2,"Overall, the rooms are pretty nice, but my experience this time was not. First, I requested wake-up calls at 6:30 and 6:40 AM. I didn't get either. My phone did ring at 6:45, but I had already shot out of bed at 6:43 when I saw the clock. When I told the front desk how upset I was, I didn't... More"
"1212",4,"As a last minute option, we decided to stop in Gatlinburg for the night while traveling. We saw the proximity of the hotel to where we wanted to be and it was a perfect option. We registered quickly and were on the way to enjoy our evening without delay."
"1213",5,"The hotel is an economy hotel but it was one of the best my spouse and I stayed in. Everyone was very friendly. Upon arrival to my room, the receptionist called and make sure everything was OK. I do not even get this kind of service at high end hotels. So Kudos to the level of service. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The location is roughly 30-45 min drive to DC depending on traffic. The swimming pool was only 6pm-10pm on weekdays and only a few hours on weekends. So If you plan to use the pool you really have to plan for it. Overall my experience for this hotel was very nice."
"1214",5,"Bad: Complimentary breakfast. Good: Location was great, right where we wanted to see some attractions. Free breakfast was a little misleading, (just say appetizers, and fruit basket). But overall, would definitely recommend, and stay again. Staff was good, and room was quiet."
"1215",4,"This is my 3rd timing staying here, and I would and do recommend it to everyone who is coming to the Dells. They have a variety of travel packages that you can't beat. I'm going there again in September. The staff is always nice and very eager to help you with anything that you need."
"1216",3,"Got off to a rocky start as the room was not ready at our check in time, guaranteed late check in. This was at 10pm on a Sunday night! The lobby was full of customers who could not check in also, at least 7 different reservations where being held up. Front desk staff had to leave check the rooms to see if they had been cleaned at 10:30! Thankful, my room was ready by then, not sure how the others made out as I wasn't sticking around to hear the complaints. The breakfast consist of powered scrambled eggs, powered egg cheese omelette, under or over cooked bacon, link or patty sausage (only one meat a day, fruit that was not fresh, and broken waffle, coffee, other machines during the week. It's food with zero taste. One of the two elevators has been out of service for the entire 8 days I have been here. The maids did do a good job cleaning the room every day. The picture on the website for the pool is a straight out lie yes, it has a pool, and no, it is only a average to small pool in size. More than 15 guest at any times makes it a little jammed. Overall, it's a room a bed."
"1217",2,"Don't know how this place has some many high reviews. The rooms were not well maintained or cleaned. The management photos are very misleading. See my attached room photos of what you really get. Sticky wet floors, sticky walls in the bathroom, thick layers of dust, blood or burn stains on the sheets, AC from the 80's that barely ran,...

"1218",3,"We had a great stay at the Ritz in Pentagon City however it was not without a few faults. First on our first night we attempted to order room service which was supposed to be available 24/7 however after letting the phone ring for over five minutes without any one answering.... Twice we tried calling the concierge and got the same lack of response so we gave up and went to bed hungry. The other issue was with the shower. The water pressure from the bath tub faucet was fine and the water was hot but on e you switched it to shower there was so little flow that it would take forever to rinse shampoo out of your hair. I eventually resorted to switching back to the bathtub faucet and used one of the glasses to rinse my hair filing it from the bathtub faucet. The next night I decided I would just take a bath instead of standing in the sprinkle of the shower however the bathtub stopper would not deal off enough to even get more than 1 inch of water in the tub. To get by I used that came glass to cover the drain and it worked well enough after I wrapped a wash cloth around the base to help seal it off. I know these seem like small first world problems, but when you are staying at the Ritz there is a certain expectation of quality"

"1221",4,"This would have been a five star review except they really need to update the place. It doesn't cost much toast least get some new towels and bedspreads. Other than that, it was just great! We were traveling with our too large dogs and they were able to hang outside on the deck with us and hike in the forest... More"
"1222",4,"The room was nice. Didn't care much for the set up though. My kids slept on a sofa bed while I slept on the King. We couldn't watch the tv. You had to swivel it one way or another.

"1229",3,"There is an 18 per day charge for parking (very well secured) which is not disclosed in the expedia information. Other than that, the hotel was pretty nice. Rooms are currently undergoing refurb, our room had the brand new carpet smell which was quite overwhelming. The staff was nice courteous. The breakfast buffet was not up to ES standards compared to others. Hotel was very clean. Oh, and the elevator, you have to take one up from the garage then another up to the rooms and elevator service was slow, small often cramped with people or guests with luggage."

"1244",2,"The members at desk were very nice but if your a clean freak then i wouldnt recommend staying here. maybe if all you plan on doing is getting some rest because the shower and floor isnt in great condition. I also had a brown stain on one of my pillows. sheets are a bit out dated."

"1254",5,"My boyfriend and I were taking a road trip to Las Vegas (starting in MI), and we planned to stop in Chicago for a night. I found this hotel online and after seeing the location as well as the price, I was sold. When we arrived, the valet personnel were extremely helpful. They gave us a map to where we could self-park if we weren't interested in using valet, which was only about 2 blocks away. While he parked, I had someone assist me with our bags. They were quick and very friendly, telling me all the things we should do during our short stay. When I got to the room, everything was nice and clean, and though previous reviews say that the room is too small, I found that it was just what we needed for a night. The bed was comfortable, there was enough room to put our multiple bags/suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had a hand-held shower head, which was nice. We were visiting family that evening, so we wanted to bring a dessert to them. We asked (who I believe was) the manager there where the nicest/closest bakery was, and he told us about Magnolias. The desserts were incredible, a very good recommendation. The next morning, we ordered room service for breakfast from the restaurant downstairs because we were too comfy to even get out of bed. The food was brought up very quickly and was not too expensive at all, plus it was delicious. The only downside to the stay was that you have to pay for parking once again if you choose to leave and come back. However, everything else was great. There is a Starbucks right next door as well as several shopping stores within walking distance. The hotel staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with were all very kind and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for our next trip to Chicago."

"1261",5,"I coordinated a group of 23 visiting Napa during the grape harvest in October, and we booked the entire group into the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines. First, let me say if youre a snob and really into posh places with fancy marble lobby floors, fluffy robes on the hook, perky concierge behind a big desk, etc. this may not be for you. But if you like to get real value, service and comfortable accommodations for a modest price, you cannot beat the Inn at the Vines. It is family owned and operated (several generations), and the service and sense of community are notable in this day and age. The place has been updated and has all the features you need..clean well furnished rooms, flat screens, very comfortable beds (we had king bed rooms), great towels, and organic soaps. To some earlier reviews about highway noise: we found it minimal and no one in our group complained. Yes, I did hear the occasional truck early in the morning or California kid with a Flowmaster exhaust doing a jack-rabbit start from the intersectionagain it was not a problem. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Front Desk Manager Shanirra did an exceptional job booking our customized winery tour, restaurant reservations, and balloon rides. As our person on the ground in Napa she was in our corner every step of the way and played a large part of a successful three days in Napa! At the front desk Melody, Shawn and Bertha were always helpful, upbeat and service-minded. Complimentary hotel breakfasts are a joke at many hotels.not so at the Inn at the Vines. There is a Dennys on the property, and you get a legitimate complimentary hot breakfast at the restaurant not some dinky room off the lobby. Try eggs any way you want, bacon/sausage and pancakes/toast and coffee. You cant beat it unless you must have Eggs Benedict and mimosas. The owners are continuously making improvements to keep up with newer hotels. During out stay a fitness center and business center were under construction. Botom line: when visiting Napa in the future I will stay at the Inn at the Vines again. Our entire group was pleased.Ed,it was a pleasure meeting you and hosting your group for your stay in the Napa Valley. I enjoyed hearing your story of what happened at the Castle. Yes, Shanirra is a great employee who is always the first to try out new restaurants and tours. All of our employees keep up to date on all there is to do in the Valley. We are family run (4th generation), and as you saw, we take pride in our Hotel. I am glad your group enjoyed their stay and maybe we can make this an annual event."
"1262",5,"I loved my stay VIP service all the way. I didn't want to leave. I can honestly say I will visit again. I give it 5 stars"
"1263",5,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. First off the staff ---every single staff member--- was helpful, courteous and went out of their way to go extra mile to make sure our stay was great. The housekeeper even took the time to arrange my kids stuffed animals in fun and creative ways. Second this was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed at. I'm a slight germ a phobe so hotel rooms can bother me. I was so comfortable in the room because it was so clean. Third, the breakfast was good and had a nice variety. Lastly the little touches like the lemon water at foyer, the milk and cookies at 8 each night and the treasure box for the kids at check out all made the stay extra memorable. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Heather"
"1264",4,"I stayed here while on a work-related trip to learn more about the Army. I was impressed with the efficient and friendly customer service.

"1272",3,"Bad: They don't even offer you some water or a complementary drink or fruit. Comparing to the charges."
"1273",4,"This is hard to do because the owners are really nice, but I have to be honest. There is a smell that seems to be in every Days Inn I've ever stayed in. Like..the rooms have a TASTE to them that isnt pleasant. I'm not talking about smoking rooms. My room was non-smoking, and it had that taste. I think it may be a product/room freshener or something that lingers. The furniture had sticky spots even after the room was cleaned, and I think its from that product. The smell gets all in your clothes, cigarettes..not good. Would I stay again Maybe. The pool was fun. The Asst Manager came to help me with an appliance issue, and while he did some things, he was supposed to come back and he never did. The pool was fun. There are all kinds of shopping and food around there. Wal-Mart/Golden Corral around the corner, good food right next door (mostly fried food though). Would I stay there again Maybe..but only AFTER seeing/smelling my room first."

"1278",3,"My complaint is that after you check in, they take you over to their concierge desk and proceed to try and sell you on a time share meeting. And hey, if you want to pay for a room and then spend two hours of your time at a time share meeting, more power to you. I don't. And I tried to be polite about it, because I believe in treating people in the service industry as you want to be treated. I understood it was part of her job and politely told her that I wasn't interested. And the first lady seemed cool about it. Then what seemed to be her supervisor came over and offered me free stuff to go to the meeting. I still said no. She proceeded to get really patronizing. By the fifth time I'm saying no, I start to not feel so polite. And when the same woman calls me up the next night in my room to try and pressure me again into going to this meeting, I just had no patience for it. I loved the room. I loved the size and the cleanliness. I hated that they repeatedly badgered me about a stupid time share meeting. I didn't pay for a hotel room to be pressured to buy a time share. If it hadn't been for that, I'd have had no problem being a repeat customer. I don't like being pressured into something I say no to. And now, a month later, I just got a call from the hotel group, again trying to get me to go to a time share meeting. Luckily, the guy was way more understanding and only made me say no once."
"1279",4,"There is not a lot to offer in Tomah but this property makes sure you enjoy your stay. The staff was genuine and friendly. Breakfast was on point every morning. My room was always comfortable. Housekeeping needs to learn how to stop adjusting my thermostat is my only complaint."

We seemed locked in to the Valet Parking which was not terrible at 15 for a weekend day. Our 6th-floor ice maker was not working so we had to get ice from one of the other floors...not a big deal, either."

"1318",3,"Bad: 1. You have to walk through the casino to the rooms-- This is irritating. 2. Water took soooo long to get to the 15th floor. Waste of water to run it 7minutes to get it hot. 3. Very costly..... Especially for it's location and to the convention center. Simply outrageous for the value. Good: 1. Staff was great. 2. Room was clean 3. Decor was lovely. 4. Food was great."

"1341",1,"This hotel is located in a quite area. Within the location of this hotel it offers awesome stores options if you are in need of additional clothing or grocery store items. I've stayed at this location on several occasions but I must say this visit did not rate anywhere near my previous stays. The water in the tub backed up which is gross and unsanitary. The surface in the tub is very slippery which should have better surfacing inside the tub. These experiences has caused me to seek future overnight/weekend stays at other 4 or 5 star hotels in the surrounding area.

Fortunately the bed was clean and ant-free. The room was clean - they just had a problem with ants which should have been taken care of. The front desk guy, a very friendly young man, did tell s when we left that the were doing complete renovations in the next few months, so this problem might soon be solved."
"1344",3,"The rooms were clean, but the hotel was more functional than inviting. The pool was small and always occupied(if more then 7 people in was crowded, it seemed) so we did not use it. Our family lived close by so it was convenient but is in middle of nowhere(although the area is being built up) if the feel was less functional and more inviting then I would have given 5's the breakfast was worth the extra money I paid for the rooms(as compared to another hotel without it)."
"1345",5,"This location is as good or better than the average Hampton Inn. Food is great. Room is great but doesn't have a fridge. The only negative is if you have a large vehicle due to the (free) parking garage on the property."
"1346",5,"Hotel is right off of the main highway into VA Beach, so it's very quick to get in and out. It is right by the boardwalk as well, within walking distance of the pier. So overall, I love the location! The room is small and divided into two section--living area (with pull out couch or another queen bed depending on room selection), and bedroom. I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus. Wife and kids loved the balcony facing the ocean, we enjoyed watching the beach at dusk. Overall, we had a very pleasant 3 nights stay at this Comfort Inn and will definitely book it for next year's trip back to VA Beach."

Not enough power outlets handy to recharge the cell phones of the group in my room. Continental breakfast was so lousy, we ate breakfast elsewhere. Elevator was out of order upon arrival (was fixed during our stay). In dire need of a renovation. If you can book it for the same price as Motel 6, then go for it, otherwise avoid until a renovation occurs."

"1361",4,"The lobby was small, but modern. The valet and check in staff were great. We had a package that included breakfast. We ordered and put both orders on one slip (Why waste paper), but the hotel charged us for one breakfast because they were not written on TWO separate tickets. The food was not so great. Pre-cooked and microwaved. Not worth the money. The room was great, but we had a corner room. The waterpressure could have been better. Overall, not too bad. Not my first choice for a NOLA hotel, but would consider it again if I had to.Glad you had a great time overall here with us at Aloft NOLA. We appreciate your feedback and are always looking for ways to improve. Like most Aloft's, our breakfast options are grab and go items aimed at quick and convenient service. On a brighter note, those corner rooms are great and offer fantastic views on the Crescent City.

"1363",4,"We spent 1 night here before a flight out of Atlanta.Pros:Super friendly staff. When we checked in the lady in reception was immediately welcoming and happy to answer my questions. Then the guy that shuttled us to the airport the next morning was just as friendly. In fact he got off the bus at the airport to unload our luggage and explained step-by-step how to get to the international terminal. Great staff!Breakfast: awesome! Sausage and eggs were delicious. They had so many choices!Room: huge room with great a/c. Two tvs and plenty of storage space. There was some dried soap on the shower wall that probably should have been cleaned before we checked in, but it's just soap, so no big deal. Also worth noting: I never heard an airplane during the night. I was worried that staying so close to the airport would be loud, but it wasn't at all. Park fly parking area is closed off and well-lit. Hopefully my car is safe. If not I'll edit this review to reflect any issues. Cons:We had an issue with the plumbing in our room. We were only there from 8 pm to 6 am so I can't say whether this was ongoing or resolved, but the toilet didn't flush well. Like it was almost backed up, but it would still flush a little. Also, it would be great if the hotel had a luggage scale. I would definitely stay here again! Con"

"1370",4,"My second stay, the last one was during the hotels remodel, had a great 2 night stay. My room was nice a spacious and nicely updated. The breakfast was decent and the wifi was fast enough for my needs. No complaints here, another great stay in Chesapeake!"

"1375",3,"Looking forward to a romantic stay, and our room offered a deep soaking tub, but when we checked in, I was told that all they had were ""normal""tubs. We were disappointed. Other than that, we had a nice stay."
"1376",4,"Bad: Initially had a two double bedded room (later switched) and the beds in this room were too small and woefully uncomfortable. Mattresses were sub standard. However, were swiftly moved to much more comfortable king bedded room. Good: ber cool. Tech savvy property with atmospheric bar area and games room. Very accommodating, knowledgeable and friendly front front desk staff. King rooms are spacious and comfortable Location could not be better."
"1377",5,"We recently spent two nights at the Inn of the Vines Best Western Plus. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well appointed. The staff was extremely helpful and welcoming. We had reservations for the Wine Train and the hotel location was ideal- only about 1 1/2 miles away."
"1378",5,"We staid only for one night and this probably was the best option in town. Rustic but gemtlich as we germans say. The owner is a nice guy and we had a great talk with him about some families from Conrad. We highly recommend this place if you go to Conrad."

"1380",4,"Great value hotel Rooms clean, easy check in and out. Nice selection of breakfast choices"
"1381",4,"I stayed in two seperate rooms at this hotel. The first was 209 upstairs over looking the shared balcony. It was small but clean and gorgeous, perfect for one person. My only complaint is the Windows don't open, as they've been painted over. Would be nice to get some fresh air, although this room has its own thermostat with air. The staff was amazing and watched my bags for me the entire next afternoon after check out, as I wasn't sure if I was gonna stay again or not. I decided to stay, and they offered me a similar rate to the first night even though prices went WAY up. The girls at the front desk are super awesome. The next room I stayed in was downstairs, definitely larger than the first, just as beautiful but different. The energy was different, it was dark, and I had a few issues with cell phone reception, not picking up the guest wifi and a broken TV that they couldn't do anything about. Overall I loved staying at this hotel. It felt special. It is special. Its a fantastic hotel to stay at if you want the NOLA French Quarter experience. On a personal note: this hotel is definitely haunted. I not only had the same dream both nights that were pretty spooky and gruesome, but I awoke the second morning to someone humming softly into my ear and a grab/scratch at the back of my neck. Let's just say my heart was POUNDING!"

"1384",4,"The hotel was located close to Gwinnett Center and restaurants. The price was very reasonable considering it had: large refrigerator, flat screen TV, internet and microwave. I have stayed at other hotels that cost more but did not have these features."
"1385",4,"Stayed for a quick family trip, the breakfast was good, scambled eggs, sausage fresh fruit and cereal. Worth waking up for! The only thing that I can say is the pool is only 4 ft deep and no hot tub. Rooms were nice."
"1386",5,"We were extremely pleased and surprised with our stay at this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and went out of the way to make our stay comfortable. There was a lifeguard at the pool and 2 computers in the lobby with internet access that we could use anytime we wanted, which we never expected. There was a full breakfast every morning which was superb! There was a shuttle to the Metro that ran from 7am-10pm and anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel, but you had to be prepared to wait. The hotel is walking distance to Springfield Mall and restaurants. Don't rent a car to go to WA DC as the Metro will get you within walking distance of the major attractions, saving you time and money. If we go back to DC we will stay there again."

"1390",4,"Hotel and room were very clean. I didn't need any extraordinary service but the staff was friendly and helpful during check-in and check out although they were a little slow and there was a ~5 min line for both. Free breakfast was the usual for a holiday inn express, which is pretty good as far as free breakfasts go. I walked from the hotel to Hominy Grill for dinner (.6 miles) and to MUSC for an interview. You are pretty close by but you have to cross multiple busy streets without a crosswalk or traffic light so it would not be walkable for everyone. Parking is free and the lot seems adequately big."
"1391",5,"Everything about this hotel was wonderful. The room was spacious and well-appointed, the staff was friendly and the food was great. We enjoyed our dinner so much the first night we had dinner again at the hotel the second night. Will definitely stay here again."

"1398",3,"While making coffee one morning and trying to iron a shirt, the circuit tripped. The sad part was that the GFI was at the END of the electrical run, not the beginning, so I had to call down to the front desk and wait for someone to reset the circuit at the electrical panel. I shouldn't have blown in the first place, but it also should be re-wired properly."
"1399",4,"The room was ok. It took 10 minutes for me to check in with no wait. The young lady at desk was apparently occupied in back office. Had to call front desk just so she would come up front. Noticed in my room there was a rag hanging on the shower that had been used and the trash can had trash in it. Went to complain and of course no one was at front desk. Didn't stay the night. Lesson learned"
"1400",3,"The rooms are nice. A bit noisy with the train but didn't bother us. Breakfast is not even worth mentioning.

Great location and intimate feel came with friends but will revisit with spouse.Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had a great stay. We appreciate the feedback as it's very important to us and we will be sure to commend Chris for resolving the issue you encountered quickly and efficiently. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and look forward to having you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"1402",5,"We have stayed here 5 times in last year. We need pet friendly room. Great view. Service is great, staff nice and friendly. Plenty of grass area to walk our dog. Beds very comfortable."
"1403",5,"Will stay here any time I'm in Virginia Beach. I truly have no complaints at all. Free cookies at check-in, the most comfortable beds and pillows ever, and one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed."
"1404",4,"Bad: Tempeture control. Fan was not automatic. Had to manually turn off and on. not a deal breaker. Good: Location and staff. Staff was very friendly and helpfull. We arrived a few hours before check in and they held our luggage while we explored the area. Lots of shopping an dinner choices close by. T was 2 minutes away. Room was nice."
"1405",2,"Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out."
"1406",3,"This hotel seems to be in the midst of a renovation. They said that they put me in one of their newly renovated rooms, so I would hate to see what the rooms looked like before. The textiles are new, but they should have invested in new mattresses and new AC units. The room felt damp and musty and I would have rather slept on the floor than on the deflated, old, lumpy mattress that they have on the bed. The rooms are extremely dark, even with every light on. I cannot believe that this is considered a 3 star hotel for Expedia. Definitely not! It feel like a motel."
"1407",5,"The hotel was nice for a weekend getaway. Nice staff and clean room. The best part was the full kitchen, which had everything you would need to cook and eat, all you need is to supply the food."
"1408",5,"Checked in July 6th. My room was perfect clear and comfortable! The keurig coffee maker is a plus! A very friendly and helpful staff made my stay great. The ruby Tuesday restaurant within walking distance is one of my favorites."
"1409",5,"My plans to use my 2 free hyatt nights in Mexico fell through but time was running out so even though I thought I was going to be wasting them by staying at Hyatt House in Seattle, I didn't have a choice. As it turns out, I made an excellent choice. Though not a luxury hotel in Mexico, our visit to Hyatt House was wonderful! Check in was straightforward and easy (with the best service ever, but more on that later). Once we were moved (by request) out of the strange angled corner room with a view that looked out on another room, we were absolutely delighted with our stay!! The room was surprisingly quiet despite being next to the street and near the Seattle Center Activities. We loved the location, literally across the street from the Space Needle! The view of the Space Needle outside our window was romantic and the rooftop terrace provide an unparalleled 360 degree view of the city. The room layout was really cool and the decor is very modern (like a boutique hotel). The bed was very comfortable (firm but not hard). A (very) minor complaint is the textured fabric of the bedspread, which was a bit rough to the touch, but the sheets were crisp and smooth. Another minor detail was that I missed having a tub for soaking, but the rain shower turned out to be fine (lots of space in shower, could use a seat or shelf for sitting) Lots of storage space (as well as hangers) if you are staying a few days and want to unpack. The kitchen was fully stocked including dish soap, which seems unusual in hotels these days for some reason I don't understand. The free hotel shuttle was a great value and breakfast was decent- a pretty good selection though crowded on Sunday morning. he only thing that wasn't perfect about our stay was the fact that housekeeping never came the second day. We put the sign on the door and saw the housekeeper next door as we were leaving, but for some reason our room was skipped. It's always nice to come home to a freshened-up room and a made bed. We had enough towels to get us through, so it was fine, especially given that everything else was so good. Saving the best part for last, let me say that more than anything I have described, what we liked most by far, about our stay at Hyatt House, was the absolutely amazing service provided by Eden at the front desk! Everyone at the front desk was truly great, but she was a shining star! I'm not sure I've ever experienced a more genuine welcome or felt as appreciated as a customer as she made my husband and I feel. Thanks to her, this was a perfect weekend getaway!"
"1410",5,"Bad: Wish we were told about the 20 discount at the restaurant next door upon our arrival. Only saw the sign as we were checking out... Good: Friendly staff and great appetizers free from 5-8! Clean room and free wifi! Excellent!"
"1411",5,"We stayed for New Years Eve 2016. From the minute we walked in the door we were treated like preferred guests. Abraham and Maria made us feel right at home. They were even kind enough to keep the bar open so we could enjoy a drink after a long day of travel. Paul, Lane, Justin and Jess were all fantastic behind the bar. The Shipwreck was out of this world and Paul should be nominated for Sainthood for the way he makes this drink. Overall, we had a fabulous stay. The pool was warm and with some adjusting of chairs we were able to catch some sunshine. The hotel location was absolutely ideal. We walked everywhere and there were wonderful places to eat and drink all around us. This is the place to stay in Key West! Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you were able to indulge in one of our delicious drinks. We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to each staff member you mentioned. Please come back and see us!"
"1412",3,"As being a guest in Chicago, you can afford the luxury of spending a couple of hours on the architectural tour through downtown Chicago. The first building they tell you about is the River hotel. Situated opposite the Trump tower, you get a feeling of the grandeur of the 1920s, when the hotel was build. It must have had the same strange feeling, you now get from the Trump tower. Ugly, grotesque, aiming at the very rich and symbolizing something which does not exist and proves to be a dream. While we now call the building historical nostalgia with its weird toptower as of floor 24, the hotel offers a mixture of the old and the new. The old is the buildings shape and elevators, the various signs and sometimes not well maintained emergency staircases. The new offering a business floor, the tiny modernized reception room, the good quality Wi-Fi and free water they serve. And it is this indecisiveness which makes or breaks this hotel. Either do the modern streak or go completely back into the history of 1920's. We were staying on a high floor and really getting in the top of the building, you are offered small floors with smaller rooms. Due to the height, rooms tend to be windy even with closed windows. The room was ok, but why this old fashioned ugly bathroom Why do they forget a bedside table and when asked for and promised, the thing, it never showed up Why have a decent desk but not enough electricity points To be fair the prices are reasonable for downtown Chicago but the hotel just misses the finesses to make it to a four star. The view from the window was amazing but the cold wind chilled up the room sometimes to an uncomfortable temperature. My advice would be stay low.Hello LowieSantiagoChile,Thank you for providing us with feedback on your stay. We are continually working to enhance the guest experience and will use your comments to do so. We hope to see you back next time you come to town."

We always enjoy seeing you and your family! Looking forward to welcoming you again!"
"1418",5,"This was one of the most memorable hotels I've stayed at from it's eclectic and fun vibe to the gracious and friendly staff. We were greeted by Angel who was top notch at explaining the hotel re-image as well as was incredibly thorough on explaining the room we reserved, it's accommodations and the awesome tablet that is a connection has everything you'll need from room service to tourist information. I will be coming to Phoenix more often in the coming years and this hotel will be where I will be staying. The room was clean and gorgeous. We were taking pictures for the first few minutes of arriving because the set-up was so appealing and balcony view of downtown Phoenix was breathtaking. We stayed in the balcony king suite and for the price-point it was such a great value. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone visiting central Arizona. Thank you to the staff and management for making a quick one night trip so much fun. You all did a superb job at conveying what your ideology for a great hotel is. P.S. The amount of charging/usb charging ports you have around the room make a techy like me giddy. James! Thank you for making out day! We're so happy to hear you loved the hotel and enjoyed your stay. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us. We do hope you will come back and visit us again soon."
"1419",5,"Always delightful. Professional and convenient"

"1428",4,"Stayed here after a day visiting the Gulf Coast beaches. It was easy to find with many restaurants and other stores in the area. The staff was friendly and pleasant. The room was spacious and clean. Excellent breakfast. Our only complaint is that the walls are so thin we could hear our neighbors."
"1429",2,"I'm surprised this hotel is even part of the Best Western chain. They supplied only one wash cloth. We got a conditioner bottle, but no shampoo. Our food was thrown away even though we had it neatly stored in a box on the coffee table. The buffet breakfast was lacking. It had stale donuts and danish. The only hot food was hard boiled eggs and grits. On the positive side, bed was comfortable and good front desk service."
"1430",5,"Needed a quiet place to spend the night during a cross country trip. This was in a quiet location and there was no noise heard from adjoining rooms. Wifi worked well and I got a good nights sleep. This is all I look for in a hotel. Would stay there again."
"1431",5,"I was driving from NY to NC and decided that I needed to rest. It was after 9pm . I pulled over to a rest stop and looked up Expedia for hotels near by.

"1434",4,"I was in town on business at the convention center, which is walking distance. This is a good place to stay, even for those visiting the Disney parks nearby. This is motel type place but renovated to modern standards with good fixtures. 2 Queen bedrooms are very spacious and clean. No breakfast here but it is close to many restaurants."
"1435",4,"I great place to stay just off Duval street. The registration staff was VERRY helpful with great suggestions. A very eclectic small hotel. A small bar area was very comfortable. Others have commented on the great bartender...that was not our experience. He seemed to be completely focused on his Brit and Aussie patrons to the exclusion of the rest of us. I would return here for the accommodations and pool area Thank your for sharing your feedback regarding your stay with us.Glad that you enjoyed our location and our facilities.However, we are sincerely sorry to hear that you had a less-than-perfect experience at our bar. And I am 100 sure that if you give them a second chance, our staff will know how to make it right to you. Our bar is one of our major asset within our establishment. Their attention to details and their natural sympathy made them become a reference in the island.We hope he will have the chance to fully meet your expectations during your next venue at the Saint."

"1440",4,"The hotel was good, not great. I didn't feel pampered - but I was comfortable (I think it supposed to be a 4 star hotel). The nice thing is that its close to the shopping mall which has a grocery store on the lower level! The mall also has a great food court also you can easily stock your room. The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. I would stay here again. However!!!! Get rid of the 7.00 charge to use the sauna, it's ridiculous moreover, they can't possibly be making any 'real' profit off of a 7.00 dollar charge."
"1441",5,"Well, they did it again. After a stay at this hotel back in August and the absolutely fabulous service from Erin Loughlin, I kept my promise of never staying anywhere else when I visit Chicago. And, because I love the great city of Chicago, I had to go back. This time, I had no question where my lodging would be as I trekked to and fro across the city streets. I LOVE the personal service. I have told so many people about my great experiences and I hope they choose to patronize this great hotel, too. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I'll be back!"
"1442",2,"It was a bad experience for me. The first room I checked into the ceilings had water stains, the shower walls were dirty and the final straw was when I pulled back the covers and what do I see, a caterpillar crawling in my bed. I was so disgusted when I saw that and when I called the front desk they told me I had to come down to switch rooms because they had one person on duty. So they put me in another room and there that had water stains in the ceiling and the toilet seat had stains on it and the room door had water stains on it. It was 1 in the morning and I was exhausted so I stayed that night but when I woke up I had bites all over my back so with that I checked out early and went to another hotel."
"1443",4,"Bad: View from room over car park. Good: Great location just off the main strip near Caesars Palace. Room comfortable and staff helpful. Allowed us to have a late check out at no extra cost."
"1444",5,"Needed a closer parking lot."
"1445",5,"Good: My wife and I stayed at the charlesmark for 4 days. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was a little small, but very clean and modern."
"1446",3,"Bad: The pool area was really disappointing. Very small and the service wasn't great. The bathroom in the room needed an upgrade. Needed a re-grouting in the shower, the sink had a huge crack in it and the sink made this weird gurgling noise when anyone above or below us turned on a tap. Good: The bed was comfortable."
"1447",5,"Bad: Gym was closed. Only notification on website was the spa closure. Good: Great + accommodating staff"
"1448",2,"We stayed at this motel for 5 months. The room, although clean, spacious and relatively bug free, (saw several roaches) was not well lit, had cracks and scratches in the walls, and was noisy. We complained about the lighting several times, and also our neighbor's squeaky door without results. Finally we just gave up, and lived with it. We checked... More"

"1452",4,"Nice place overall and doing friendly so we were able to enjoy a few days together with our four legged family member. The place is very close to Heavenly, bars, restaurants, groceries and the lake. Stuff was very friendly."
"1453",2,"The hotel is OK ,the guy on the front desk was very nice ,the rooms are OK BUT in the morning I had a few bed bug bites and there is no continental breakfast just protein bars . On top of that upon check out I ask the lady at the front desk for a receipt and she told me she can't give me one cuz I book the room over the Internet but when I checked in I signed a paper with the amount and just wanted a copy of that page but she refused to give me cuz it was for the hotel use only ... So ridiculous . She wasn't on a mood or something but very rude so if you can find another hotel go there ..."

"1456",5,"Good: Loved our room, bed, breakfast buffet, fridge in room, free WiFi , location, happy hour, and outstanding suggestions and great help from Concierge, Ken. Highly recommend this hotel."
"1457",4,"Built in 1898 this hotel has some charm. Priced like one of the new, right off the freeway type hotels, this one is special. Downtown, small old town with lots of history and plenty of good shopping and restaurants."
"1458",3,"We checked in on April 29-30 2016 and were looking to enjoy a free breakfast as listed on the website for this property. To our dismay, it was not included and does not even offer free coffee in the lounge. My wife was told it is in your room! We stayed at the Fairfield Inn in Matthews, NC two days... More"

"1465",5,"Bad: Little storage space in the room small bath. But I knew that when we booked the room from other reviews, so it was as expected especially in boutique hotel. No complaints. Good: Nicely decorated boutique hotel just a couple of blocks south of the crazy South Beach scene. Several upscale restaurants a short walk away down the quiet side of South Beach. Enjoyed complimentary breakfast on the porch. Comfortable bed with nice pillows."
"1466",1,"This is the motel that began my boycott of all Motel 6's. Two obviously drunk people asked me for a ride and I said no, so they got belligerent. I made my way to the office to report them and they followed me. They waited for me for over half an hour outside the office, yelling profanities and threatening to... More"
"1467",5,"Did not take long at the check in counter. The room was clean and a great shower with lots of water pressure. Food was very good for comp breakfasts. Stayed only one night. Have used Hampton in the past and will again. First time in this location, but glad we stayed."
"1468",5,"Bad: The doormen could have reacted a bit quicker to open the inner doors, which were very heavy. They sprang into action for the outer doors, but saw a dad with buggy struggle to get through, and people with cases, let in through the outside door, and having to open the inner door themselves with luggage. Good: The welcome was great. Staff were helpful and interested. The room was stylish and spacious, with great facilities in the room like iPod Dock."

"1471",5,"Great spot with kids and family. Would definitely stay here again. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Convenient to reading market. Nice to have breakfast included and hot coffee available all day. Kids loved the pool - although it was small."
"1472",4,"nice people great location. good room. clean and friendly"
"1473",5,"We always stay at this Hampton on our way down to Florida. It is always clean and well maintained. The staff is always courteous and friendly. It is located right off Interstate 95 and very convenient. We make this stop 3-4 times a year. Wouldn't stay anywhere else."
"1474",2,"The price of the room says it all. It is a cheap hotel room. Clean and OK to stay for a single night when you want a cheap hotel to come in late and stay overnight and get up early and leave. However, the only real big problem with the place is the smell of cigarette smoke that permeates the room!!! It is unbelievable. DO NOT turn on the fan in the bathroom and bring an air freshener. With the LOUD air conditioner on, the room becomes air becomes equalized enough to sleep there. You have been warned !"
"1475",4,"Family of 4. First few nights were in 1 bdrm unit. Fold out coach bed was pretty uncomfortable no one wanted to sleep on it. Ended up upgrading ( expensive) but 2 bdrm unit was fantastic.

"1478",5,"The room was clean, the beds very comfortable, and the property well maintained, but it was the friendly, warm-hearted proprietor who made this place special.

The free breakfast was good with sufficient choices including fresh fruit salad, eggs, bacon, bagels and pastries and more. It was a great location for our purpose:... More"
"1481",4,"The hotel was nice for the price the hot breakfast could have been better the food tasted like it was all made in the microwave. Which ot probably was it is just that scrambled eggs made in the microwave do not taste very good."
"1482",4,"We stayed for the weekend and made trips back and forth to the beach. It's about a 20 minute drive to the beach but we didn't run into any traffic. The continental breakfast was great! The hotel staff was great! Definitely would stay again!"
"1483",4,"Bad: Breakfast was not included and in my opinion too expensive, especially for guests of your hotel. They told us it was a buffet and 15 per person. We didn't even check it out at that point. Good: Location was within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile. Price was reasonable for the location."
"1484",5,"This is NOT your typical hotel that allows pets. It is exactly what you'd expect from the Hilton/Hampton brand. Clean, lovely dcor and bedding. I highly recommend this motel and wish there were more like it so we could travel with our pet without lowering our expectations."
"1485",4,"This was a very pleasant hotel. Our suite had a dishwasher, a full sized Fridge, a sink and kitchen cupboards in it. It also had a kitchen table, a private bedroom and a living room area. The room did have a couple of dirty spots, which I didn't notice right away- but other than that, it was a great room,... More"
"1486",4,"I stayed here for a couple of comp'd nights and had heard that the rooms were remodeled, so I was looking forward to it and had somewhat lofty expectations. I was admittedly impressed. The room was larger than expected, tastefully decorated, and had a great view of the golf course next door and the mountains beyond. It had a good-sized desk in the corner nearest the floor-to-ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair. The internet speed was decent, although I had to call support for connectivity assistance. Cox support got me online quickly. The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks, a large tub/shower, and roomy toilet area. The whole room was just great! The housekeeping staff was fantastic, getting me whatever I asked for quickly. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful, polite, and helpful! As for the casino, the sports book area was large and not overly busy. There was a limited amount of table games, but the common, basic ones were all there. The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh! If you're looking for a golf getaway place to stay, or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and don't want to spend a fortune,THIS IS IT! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games. Otherwise, it's 5+ stars all the way!"
"1487",5,"No Hassles, No problems. Perfect Quality Hotel. Room was in great condition. Every Staff member was amazing and caring. From the breakfast staff to the front desk concierge. It is in a perfect location too. And Breakfast was of good quality."
"1488",4,"Bad: Breakfast, though a big step up from the basic continental breakfast, was a little disappointing. The hot option was a choice of three different flatbreads that you can toast yourself. Also, it's only served from 6AM-9AM, fine for business travelers but a bit early for our weekend visit. Good: The hotel seems to cater to long-stay visitors, so the room was set up like a small apartment with couch, TV, desk, and well-equipped kitchen area with a full-sized fridge, plates and silverware, microwave, and dishwasher. Furniture and decor were modern and well thought-out."
"1489",5,"My stay was very short with actually only being a night sleep and catch an early flight however the room was clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and helpful."
"1490",5,"Staff was excellent and very helpful and accommodating. Stay in Cabin3.....absolutely loved loved loved it. Very clean and stocked with everyday essentials for cooking out and dining. Would recommend highly and I already have my week booked for July. Can't wait. Thanks to the staff that made our stay outstanding."
"1491",3,"homey. nice terraces. Lovely living room. unpretentious. not your standard-issue motel."
"1492",5,"Bad: Parking is probably the only downside. You have to park in a parking garage which is fine, but expensive. But I guess thats what you get for staying in the city. It was all worth it though because the location was amazing. Good: The location is amazing. We were able to walk to everything. The room was clean and comfortable for my family of 4. The free breakfast was also great. We had an issue with internet that was taken care of really quickly. We had a great time and look forward to staying again"
"1493",4,"Bad: Bed is too small for two people and the blanket is too thin. The staff are just ok not very friendly though. Good: Location and the New England style building and the room is cute."
"1494",2,"Confusing and less than desirable internet, front desk was no help. Room was so so. my particular room had an a/c that smelled like a dirty foot but perhaps it's just that room. Granite by rest room was weirdly stained, I'm not sure how that happens"
"1495",5,"Cleanliness of the hotel was spot on. The staff at check in was very helpful. The room was very large and could accommodate my family with comfort and ease. A great stay and a great value."
"1496",4,"great value for the money! always friendly staff with years of experience. Great hot breakfast as well as traditional continental menu. As the name implies, jokingly, it is next door to Denny's. close to the expressway is a big plus."

So my one negative will be fixed!!. Good: The staff was amazingly friendly! Breakfast was on each guest room floor and got to have breakfast in bed!! Free food and drink in the lounge every night. It was so easy to get around the city. Most of it was within walking distance, but I took the L to Wrigley Field. Super Easy! Free Wifi as well."

"1523",3,"Although clean, this hotel is in great need of renovation. Breakfast is the usual selections. Front desk was most helpful when we inquired about a local church and their times of services. Tha hotel was very close to several restaurants within walking distance, and the Interstate and, most importantly, the Ice Arena."
"1524",5,"Nothing Great bed and shower. All you need. Great help yourself continental breakfast and liked the drink and snacks in the evening. Fabtastic location"
"1525",5,"Bad: air conditioner was a quite noisy when it came on."
"1526",5,"We were thoroughly satisfied with our stay at Holiday Inn Express.  For a budget hotel, the surroundings were clean, freshly painted, and we commented that the bedding was the most comfortable of any we'd slept in.  We would definitely recommend this hotel."
"1527",4,"I was pleasently surprised with the quality of the room and it's location. It was quite literally 3 minutes drive time from the Washington Monument and 10 minutes walk time from the metro. The staff was very helpful and the room large. It had a mini kitchen complete with stove, fridge microwave and sink. If I needed an inexpensive place to stay in DC for the week and didn't want to have to eat out every night this would be the place. It's age was showing, carpet stains, peeling wallpaper etc, but the staff was excellent and the rooms very comfortable. No one's home is perfect and this hotel isn't either, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay and can handle it not being absolutely perfect you'll be very happy with Virginian Suites."

However, at National Harbor 11 is not bad especially when Gaylord charges double of it per day."
"1552",5,"The room was comfortable, quiet and clean. The desk staff was super helpful. They even lent me a wall charger for my phone for the night (and offered to let me keep it when I went to return it the next morning). I was given directions to a great neighborhood to run through. Wonderful stay!"
"1553",5,"nothing the location and the front desk girls were excellent."
"1554",4,"The room was a lot nicer than I expected. The hotel staff at the front desk was amazing. Very helpful. Clean good smelling rooms. Pretty pool. Breakfast had hardly anything very cramp and not worth it. We left and went to McDonalds. The wifi was terrible. They gave me a wifi password at the front desk and when I went... More"
"1555",4,"Bad: I didnt like being charged 35.00 a night for parking when everything I needed was within walking distance. I will choose a different place next time."
"1556",4,"I was there for business and it served my needs very well. The room was a good size and the bed was comfortable. The staff is especially friendly and accommodating."
"1557",5,"Good: Perfection - beautiful rooms, comfortable beds, great style. Centrally located for all the fun things in downtown Boston."
"1558",3,"What I needed for a working trip"
"1559",4,"It's a great place to stay and leave a car if you are flying out. The courtesy shuttle takes 10 minutes to get to O'Hare."
"1560",3,"Basic needs met late arrival OK. Great price!"
"1561",4,"Bad: There is no longer a casino, and the pool is seasonal despite it easily being warm enough to be used. The sauna was also out of action. With the lack of these attractions it becomes a very plain hotel. Good: Staff throughout the hotel are excellent, especially at the bar on the late night shift and on reception. Very friendly people. Hotel well presented, clean and comfortable. Location is great, a short walk to bellagio, Paris etc for those who want to be near the strip but not on it all the time!"
"1562",1,"Nothing thing was nice worst hotel I had ever in my life"
"1563",4,"Overall the staff, hotel cleanliness and the amenities like breakfast was up to my satisfaction. Even though the Hotel had signs apologizing for renovations I am so happy that we didn't hear or had any complaints concerning the renovations. We didn't even notice the people or rooms being renovated. My stay was enjoyable with piece and quiet all around just like I love my stays. The only complaint which wasn't a big issue for me was the slow internet service provided. Although it was complimentary free wifi, I think I would of paid a few dollars for quicker faster internet wifi services on my stay. No biggie if you don't need it. The bed was more comfortable than I had expected I give you guys 5stars on comfort and cleanliness! I will be coming back here on my next stay!"
"1564",4,"Bad: Shaving Stuble in the sink and I tried to book a King and got a Double. Good: Location"

"1566",5,"Really nice hotel, clean, big room and less the 8 min from the airport"
"1567",5,"The staff welcomed us and took care of our every need. We are both handicapped and they did our best to meet our every need. We were very pleased with the Garden Inn and the staff. The room was very clean and all amenities were in place."
"1568",4,"This hotel was a really good selection for our late night flight arrival before a transatlantic cruise beginning the next day. Warm welcome, room was perfect, and rapid confirmation onto the separate cruise port shuttle the next day. Although extremely crowded, the staff was wonderful and handled the large volume of guests expertly. Morning free breakfast was quite good and... More"
"1569",3,"Great location, a few steps from the beach which was lovely and all the restaurants and bars. The room had been renovated but very cheaply and the room smelt very musty. The bed was comfortable and the staff friendly. Parking space was available as requested."
"1570",5,"This may be the best motel I have ever stayed in. My wife still wants to go back so we can sleep in the bed again. Very nice!"
"1571",4,"Good: Good location if you're keen on exploring Little Tokyo and eating ramen. Some great ramen across the road :) Little gritty on the streets since it's on edge of downtown."
"1572",5,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel, it was a beautiful hotel without being too nice for our family with 4 small children. My husband and I love nice boutique hotels, but with small kids that's not going to happen. This was a great hotel for a combination of beauty and practicality. Also, we had a great view of... More"
"1573",2,"Although the hotel is in a convenient location and was inexpensive, the housekeeping is not acceptable. Sheets were not changed. Towels were not replaced. Sink was not clean. In addition, there were sketchy people in the lobby and hanging around the premises. Did not feel safe or comfortable. Would not stay here again."
"1574",4,"We needed an overnight stop for our travels from Minnesota to Illinois. This hotel worked out great. Very clean and comfortable. Slept well. Breakfast vouchers for attached Perkins restaurant were great!"
"1575",1,"I have stayed in some hotels in my time, but this was bad. If you want to experience an awful nights sleep, nasty ignorant staff, then this is for you. Southern hospitality it is not. I was not impressed with the layout of the room and the noise next door was horrendous.Thank you for taking time out of your day to share your comments about your recent stay with me. Please accept my sincere apologies for the difficulties and situations you encountered during your visit, I would like to find out a little bit more about the interaction with the staff so i can address approporately.

Would you be willing to visit us again Please contact me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com to discuss."
"1576",5,"Our trip was for business. We found the staff to be very helpful. We would stay there again."
"1577",3,"Red Roof Inn is 100, smoke free, but that doesn't prevent people from smoking right outside their doors and therefore talking every hour in a half outside your door too and the smell of smoke that surrounds you every time you walk out or in. The room is what you pay for, location is right off the highway so convenient, it is 10 to 15 minutes away from everything."
"1578",2,"We requested 2 beds. We got only one. There was a recliner positioned in a strange place in the room. The room was for handicapped people so the shower had a seat in it and a hand held shower head. Not tall enough to stand under."
"1579",4,"Friendly desk clerk gave me clear directions to my room and how to use the wifi. The clean room with fridge and microwave was a pleasure, the price a bargain. I enjoyed opening my door to the courtyard trees. The hotel is just off the main drag surrounded by trees and a touch of nature. I only wish more or the exercise room equipment worked."

"1592",1,"The place is a dump. Room was filthy and looks like it wasn't cleaned. I stood at the front desk for 5 minutes before she even acknowledged me. The room was musty and was almost afraid to lie down on the sheets because of bedbugs. Stay anywhere else but here. This place should be condemned."

The location was great, near the park and Peace Center. Many restaurants near by. We ate at the Nose Dive, under the hotel. Had burgers and beer. The room was disappointing because it was so damp from the humidity. The AC was cool enough, just too damp."

"1606",5,"Bad: It's not a negative per se but, breakfast could be more widely selective. But what was there was absolutely fantastic. Good: We were super-well accommodated, the staff was super-friendly and helpful. Location is great, and even on a loud street you couldn't here a thing."

"1620",5,"Carneros Inn offers the perfect balance of privacy, Excellent service, great food and luxurious accommodations. And the location is perfectly situated in Carneros, which is cooler and close to both Napa and Sonoma."
"1621",5,"The hotel staff was wonderful. The room was comfortable and spacious. Good value."
"1622",4,"Bad: The area around the hotel is a bit rough with the tenderloin being so close the streets around the hotel are not the nicest. You really have to get an uber or use public transport to get somewhere for a nice walk in the evening. The one positive on the location is that you are near to a transport hub so easy to get away from the area. Good: Hotel facilities were great. Breakfast at the restaurant was good and the bar served nice cocktails. Lots of games are bonus when waiting for people or something to do before bed. The hotel rooms are comfortable and spacious."

"1629",5,"I cannot say enough good things about the comfort level and cleanliness of this hotel. Great breakfast items, vast majority of goodies. They even have fresh berries for your cereal toppings. Great coffee too. Very comfortable bed and lots of plush pillows. Clean workout room with good machines."
"1630",4,"Bad: Even tough considered an exlusive hotel it is quite expensive for what you get and the hotel parking is way too expensive. The TV location in the room is a bit forced and not so comfortable from all angles. Good: Fantastic location, great personal attention from the staff. Very clean."

"1635",5,"Great getaway"
"1636",2,"We rarely were able to park near our room, and the one time we did another guest slammed their car door into our motorcycle. There was no real enforcement of any of the rules or common courtesies. The pool was only open until 1000 each night even though it is in a resort town were most activities run well into the evening. We were only able to use the pool once our entire stay. We used the laundry our last day there before our trip home and some of our clothes were stolen from the dryer. There was supposedly cameras there but we were told they could not access the video from them. Out of the entire 5 nights we were there the maid only serviced our room twice, but they were sure to leave a tip card in the room. If the service was exemplary we would have tipped them on our own. The balconies were covered with spiders. We told the front desk twice about it and their reply was to have the maid sweep it off. They then turned the lights off for the rest of our stay. Now we could not see the spiders on the chairs, the railings, and the doorways. Needless to say, no one used the balconies. Refridgerator in the room was not turned on, and when we did turn it on it was noisy and ineffective. The hotel itself looks like it needs updated badly. The beds were lumpy and the pillows uncomfortable. The walkway around the hotel along the water was dirty and in poor repair as well."
"1637",2,"Staff was pleasant. Breakfast was a little better than average. They had waffles, eggs,sausage, fruit and the usual pastries. Our room was old, smelled of cigarette smoke. Water damage, loose fixtures in the bathroom. Was supposed to stay 4 nights but found better accommodations after 2."

"1641",3,"I had asked for a handicap room but did not get one. I guess I would rate the hotel as a 3. The road leading to the hotel was very rough....out of control of the hotel. The hotel offered a very small breakfast area....enough for maybe 6 people. Not what was pictured. Limited parking due to the bar and many Christmas parties."
"1642",4,"Hotel is very nice, but I waited an hour at the metro station for the hotel shuttle bus. I called the hotel twice to ascertain the shuttle's whereabouts, but the shuttle's location remained a mystery. Perhaps it was someone's dinner break I would have walked, it isn't that far, but this was shortly after the big snow storm."
"1643",2,"We were the only people staying that night. Across the road the hotel had many guests for that night...tells you something, does it not. Also our room had a noisy fan and the heat was hard to control"
"1644",4,"Everyone was very friendly and our room was nice and clean. My room had yellow sinks and toilet and a phone in the bathroom just like the 70's and 80's Vegas. Would definitelygo back. The only drawback was the breakfast buffet. Although it was given to us free for the first night the food was lousy. Du Pars was a much better choice.Thank you for your review! We appreciate it. If you have any advice on how we can earn that last star, then please let us know, because our goal is to provide you with five-star service."

There is a shuttle bus until 10 pm to the metro stop, which is the last stop on the line. It takes 30-45 minutes to get to the center of Washington. The shuttle can fill up, and can take a while to pick you up. We did find parking at the metro stop lot, but that can fill up."

"1655",5,"Place was awesome, clean rooms, pool, breakfast was good, coffee ready all the time, helpful staff, bed was great, had no problems with anything during my stay, i would stay at this hotel again was for work"
"1656",4,"If you're looking for a motel to spend a night at cheap it is a fairly good deal. The room was clean, but it had a slight order. Tthe bed covering had some burn holes and tears. The eating area is somewhat small and breakfast selection was very basic. The bottom line: If this is a stop off on the way from point A to point B and you want to save some money for your vacation you might give it a try. If you are real particular about where you stay, then you might want to try another motel. considering the money I saved and service I received, I would stay there again"

"1659",5,"Have stayed at quite a few of the Hyatt House/Place brand hotels. EAch has a nice sized room, divided up, make it very convenient if sleeping schedules are the same. Nice TV, everything was in the room as needed. A great stay!"
"1660",5,"Bad: The lack of free parking. Good: The staff were very friendly and helpful. They were responsive very quickly to my concerns"
"1661",5,"Building is 4 story, approximately 4 years old. The staff is very efficient and quite friendly (Just what you expect when in Mississippi). Good breakfast. The hotel is near the I-22 corridor and quite close to Natchez Trace Parkway. Rooms for my two separate visits were clean and spacious. Definitely a choice in the future."
"1662",5,"Wonderful suite hotel in Flagstaff. Convenient, although not in town. This I see as a positive. Everything was clean and efficiently run. Room was simple but very adequate for our needs which were just two nights and would be fine for long-term stays, as well. Really, we were delighted with this hotel."

"1668",4,"For being located in the city of D. C. the price was reasonable. My biggest complaint was that I booked ahead of time through Expedia and paid using my credit card. When I arrived I noticed that they gave AAA members a discount and asked if I can get the discount being that I am a member. Of course, they said sorry but you already paid for the room and there is nothing we can do about it. Gotta love it when computers tie the hands of people from being able to do what's right. I should have been able to receive this discount but, the computers would not allow it. This is wrong. In the past before modern technology they would have done this. While all this was happening there was a gentlemen next to me that complained about a price variance due to not receiving a AAA discount and the staff did an over-ride for him because he did not pay yet. I'm not sure I can use services such as Expedia again if this is the result. I hate feeling ripped off and I definitely was in this case so no more Expedia for me unless I get my discount back."
"1669",5,"The staff went above and beyond to make our stay the best it could be!"
"1670",4,"Valet service takes too long. You can try to call before, but with me they never picked up the phone. Advice is to get down 30 min before you need your car. Staff was very kind when you managed to get hold of them. Good property overall, specially for the price."
"1671",5,"Clean and modern hotel.5 minutes to walk to the french quarter.friendly stuff.the only negative thing is the expensive valet parking service for about 45 dollars a day.we parked in a parking 2 roads away for 20 dollars per day (perdido street).So glad you enjoyed your time here with us, we hope you return again on your next trip. Valet is an expense here in downtown NOLA but our guys do a great job ensuring our guests are well taken care of. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"1672",5,"I very much enjoyed my stay. The room was excellent and the location perfect for my business trip. It turned out to be very near many tourist attractions as well. I give special kudos to the staff - I left a shirt in the room as I was trying to make a hasty exit to get to a meeting and the staff was wonderful about getting the shirt and shipping it back to me. All in all, a wonderful stay!"
"1673",5,"Bad: No casino."
"1674",4,"Bad: The valet parking was the worst at one time waited 45 min then 30 min for my vehicle to arrive. Twice the excuse given was the ticket inside vehicle was wrong."
"1675",4,"We looked for a place around the Plaza but most of them were booked or way over priced. Stayed here for less than 100 a night and was very happy.

"1677",4,"I so loved this hotel. The breakfast was great, although it was the same thing daily. I love the separate bedroom with a door. Every minor problem we had, someone was there to correct immediately. We stayed here to attend a convention in DC."
"1678",3,"Every Year myself and some friends go to the dells to hit up the bars. This hotel is right downtown, so you are walking distance to all the bars. The owners were very nice. Now the rooms are just pretty much two beds and a TV. There is nothing special in the rooms. They are clean and do not smell.... More"
"1679",5,"Just have to give this hotel a thumbs up for making a great visit to the French Quarters even better.

The room was clean, everything was... More"

Continental breakfast ok. All night, as we checked in late, people,guests outside smoking and littering their cigarette butts all over. Don't recomend!"
"1682",5,"Great place to stay. Our daughters softball team participated in the OKC challenge we attended the women's college World Series. Hotel was not centrally located but we didn't mind driving around. Hotel was clean, AC worked well beds were soft. Very good quality for what we paid."

"1685",3,"i made this choice because it was close to the airport and we were not arriving until late. did not want to have to drive around trying to find a hotel."
"1686",4,"Bad: We felt that the hotel was overpriced for the amount we paid. Neither my wife nor I felt that it was worth 265 a night. We make it a point to stay at Hilton properties whenever possible, and this was our first visit to a Hilton Garden Inn it will probably be our last. While the property was nice, it was not what I expected for the price. We get a better value from Hampton Inns. Good: Our room was well appointed and comfortable. As I have come to expect from Hilton properties overall, the hotel was nice."
"1687",5,"Hampton Inns are always my first choice when I travel. They are always clean, the staff extremely friendly, the rooms clean and nice, the breakfast delicious. They are an amazing value for the price. There is always a gym and a pool and everything is always well maintained."

"1692",1,"unhappyr We camped there last year. This year we considered going back but the river has flooded the area and our campsite is still muddy and it is July 18th. The owner still wants the full summers rate for camping which, by the way, she raised the prices this year. The owner is constantly sitting at her picnic table and scowls at the campers. She doesn't smile. When she told us that the rates couldn't be discounted we told her that we wouldn't be camping there this year. She said fo...view morer us to get our stuff out of there in one week or she would call the authorites. She said we couldn't camp there ever again. Her son is wonderful and helps his mom run the campground but he has to listen to his controlling mother. She also charges 2 dollars a head for visitors. She's all about the almightly dollar. She called us unfaithful. She even doesn't like our 2 little daschunds. They need to be tied up. Save yourself some money and heartache. DON'T STAY HERE!r r rview less"

"1696",5,"Aria is excelent on al counts for a Las Vegas stay. It has excellent facilities and service is great in all areas of the hotel. Considering its size, it does provide high quality in all respects. I have had excellent experiences at this hotel and our last stay was no exception."

The Beacon Inn enhances this experience by providing clean updated lodging with extras available if desired. The staff is happy and around. There's a great computer if one doesn't want to set up...

"1698",4,"Bad: the hotel was just ok the employees were friendly and helpful but the area is a little rough, had to walk 4 or 5 blocks before you found anything going on other than other hotels. The area outside of the hotel is dirty up and down the streets."
"1699",5,"We began staying here when it first opened. We also enjoy the military discount. You can always count on it to be very clean and has all the amenities and more for needs of any family. Also, location is great!"
"1700",1,"Do not stay here. Filthy. Sleep in your car if you need an alternative. The board of health should close this hotel down. The manager was rude, the rooms were filthy, smelled like smoke. Would not even sleep under covers."

When they changed our rooms, it was a little better, but no refrigerator (I have four children, no refrigerator is... More"
"1702",5,"Bad: The bar is a little on the expensive side. Drinks are very small for the price. The bartender we had was very slow and not very friendly. We waited about 10 minutes before we were served. It wasn't busy either. Good: Staff was very nice and helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient."
"1703",4,"Clean, big, motel room... Old but very clean, extra comfortable bed. Free fast wi-fi. Breakfast- basic: muffin, bagel, jam, butter, cooked egg and yogurts. Negative: reception staffs are not friendly and the price is relatively high for a motel in Pullman."
"1704",5,"Very clean and quiet. Seemed like a newly built or renovated property. Good breakfast. Nice location. Convenient to Glocester and Mathews. No complaints at all. I would definitely recommend this location.Thank you so much for your recent review of the Hampton Inn in Gloucester!

"1706",5,"Hotel was easy to locate and very clean. Bed was not comfortable."
"1707",4,"Spent one night here after travelling from Orlando through the Everglades and the Keys. Excellent first impression, clean, bright lobby, quick check in and a fantastic concierge who provided us with maps and advised on local attractions, etc. The room was a good size with TV, fridge, adequate storage space and complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. I was travelling with a friend and had booked a King room prior to arrival (there had been no other options on the website), however, reception offered us double queen room at no extra cost on check in. Breakfast consisted of hot and cold items sausage patties, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, orange juice, tea/coffee. Good quality and plenty available. Available in the lobby and included in the room rate.The only thing that lets this hotel down slightly is the location. The main Street in Key West is Duval street, which is a good hours walk from the hotel. A taxi costs upwards of 20 dollars. We had a rental car and ended up driving a lot of the street parking is permit only and the car parks are expensive but we managed to park for free on a residential street. Perhaps a shuttle to and from the hotel would be a nice extra touch.A good hotel, would stay again if travelling back to Key West.Thank you for your comments and feedback. So glad you enjoyed your visit to our property and had an excellent first impression. The team does an amazing job maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, and getting our guest checked in quickly so they can enjoy the Island. Thanks for staying with us. Hope to see you back soon."

"1711",5,"Nice hotel with a lovely pool. Near to Newport Beach. It is on a busy intersection and is hard to get in and out of. Otherwise the rooms are quiet and clean. The restaurant is pleasant but the service was slow even though they were not busy. Easy access to John Wayne Airport."
"1712",4,"We booked this room last minute. The room was clean and bed comfortable. The staff were great. I asked for an extra pillow and the gave it to me, no questions asked. Next time we go to the area, we will book a room from them."
"1713",3,"I BOOKED THE HOTEL THRU HOTELS.COM. I ASKED FOR A ROOM WITH A BALCONY BUT NOT ON THE GROUND FLOOR. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. THE MANAGER CALLED THE ROOM AND SAID THEY WOULD CHANGE US TO A 2ND FLOOR ROOM THE NEXT DAY. I ALSO NOTED THAT WE WERE IN TOWN FOR A FUNERAL, SO WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO CHANGE IN AND OUT OF ROOMS. WE WERE THERE FOR 2 NIGHTS. ON THE NEXT DAY OUR ROOM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CLEANED THERE WAS A NOTE LEFT FROM HOUSE KEEPING STATING THAT THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE BED BECAUSE WE LEFT LUGGAGE ON THE BED(THAT WAS NEW FOR ME. WE HAVE STAYED AT RESIDENCE INN AND THAT WAS NEVER AN ISSUE). THE WORSE PART WAS THAT THE HOUSEKEEPING STAFF LEFT THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPEN. WHEN WE ARRIVED BACK FROM THE FUNERAL LATE THAT EVENING THE DOOR WAS OPEN. WE DIDN'T KNOW IF SOMEONE WAS IN THE ROOM CLEANING OR IF IT WAS AN INTRUDER. MY HUSBAND JUST PUSHED IT OPEN AND THERE WAS NO ONE THERE, THE DOOR WAS JUST LEFT OPEN. NOT VERY RESPONSIBLE ON THEIR PART. I HAD SOME JEWELRY AND A LAPTOP IN THE ROOM."
"1714",5,"Loved the breakfast!!"
"1715",1,"I didn't stay. I checked in for about an hour and was totally disgusted from what I saw and smelled..Room was dirty, the sliding glass door was broken and it had no screen to cover the door if u opened it. Furniture was broken, the refrigerator was dirty, the curtains had cigarette burns and dirt marks all over them. I would not recommend this hotel at all."

"1718",4,"Located centrally, Westin Poinsett makes a good choice for a peaceful stay in SC. You can walk up to multiple small shops , cafes, restaurants and even a supermarket and wine shop. Rooms are comfortable though breakfast could have been better spread-out."
"1719",2,"I want to emphasize that the problems I describe here were dealt with by the overworked night staff (desk manager and shuttle bus driver/handyman who went out of their way to solve the problem of our room. I have stayed in this hotel over the years but this was worst experience and perhaps the last time. It looks as if management has cut staffing to the bone. At hotel desk I waited for nearly 20 minutes. The clerk was with a guest of the hotel who had a problem. The guest explained the problem at least five times the clerk kept forgetting details -- because he never wrote anything down -- instead repunching the same mistakes into the computer over and over again. No one else came out to help and he kept repeating mistakes. The guest, a businessman, was very patient and stepped aside to let me check-in. The clerk finally got to me. We loaded up a baggage cart and went up to the sixth floor. We found a nice room at well over 100 degrees. It is seemed as if policy is to completely turn off air conditioning between guests. Downstairs lobby was cool and pleasant. Upper level lobbies and room were very hot. Room faced afternoon sun directly unshaded. We set the AC on cool hoped for the best. I went downstairs to use the business center which is a computer in an open area with children playing on it. A child got up but no obvious reset function for privacy and screen faced a group of children hanging out. Hotel also needs to reduce loitering in parking lot."
"1720",5,"We stayed at the Aira hotel in September 2016 great room great hotel very clean one warning dont buy the in room water 12.00 for 700ml walk outside to supermarket 3.00 for 1 Litre same brand maybe the Yorkshire Yorkshire man in me."
"1721",5,"Got off to a rocky start, but after I was able to make the staff aware of my concerns my stay was FANTASTIC. I will Definitely make this my location of choice when I am in the DC area. I would also like to state there is no one staff member that I can commend over anther. I have been in the service industry for 25 years and it takes a lot to impress me I am impressed!"
"1722",4,"We had a very good stay at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. I had been worried about the breakfast because I had seen some reviews that hated the warm up eggs and breakfast sandwiches but I thought they were just fine and there were a few other good options. The only thing that sucks about the warm up sandwiches is the waste it makes. Itd be nice if the wrappings were recyclable.The only negative thing I would say is that the rooms are showing a need for a deep clean. There is dirt accumulating in the corners and soap scum on the shower shelves. The room in general was clean but definitely showed signs of cleanliness neglect if that makes sense. Location is excellent for two reasons. 1) central to all of the attractions which makes everything super walkable and 2) right across the street from Reading Terminal which was awesome!"
"1723",4,"Room was smelly but everything else was nice, especially the hot breakfast."
"1724",5,"This was a great place to stay it was clean plenty of clean towels and I was able to wash our beach clothes. It was only 10-15 min away from Destin and the great selection of breakfast was great my kids loved the waffle maker. Very spacious rooms and affordable"

"1727",2,"Well first off, I paid for a King with a sofa bed Non-smoking. When I arrived and checked in, once in the room I discovered I had been given a full size bed. I immediately called down to the front-desk and the manager said she was all out of Non-smoking King rooms and that she didn't know why Hotels.com booked me and charged me for that room. I told her I had paid for it already and was told that I would have to take it up with Hotels.com. I was extremely upset and she offered me a Smoking King room. I wasn't comfortable with that but because my two small boys wanted to stay in the hotel (just for the pool) I agreed to the king room smoking. We all have allergies so I was a bit uncomfortable staying there but did it to please my boys."
"1728",3,"Bad: Difficult to reach reservation staff (no tollfree number, nobody answering phone during business hours, long waits on hold), inflexibility in changing a reservation a week in advance, not enough towels, toilet too low and tub too high. A bit pricey... Good: Location, quality of free toiletries"
"1729",3,"Good for the price. The handle on sink popped off when we first arrived, but they fixed it promptly. Staff all had smiles and were very helpful."

I couldn't have asked for a better stay, and I will definitely stay at this wonderful hotel again! FIVE STARS."
"1733",3,"It is hard for me to review an oceanfront hotel. I go for the ocean and not necessarily the hotel.

Our room was very clean and modern... More"
"1734",3,"We were there to just stop for a night on our way to the outer banks... although I will admit that our drive down was horrible, so we may have been more sensitive than normal, but this place had zero options for food or drinks.

Will sleep in car next time and save 200"
"1735",5,"Friendliest staff of any hotel I've ever stayed in."
"1736",2,"Imagine our disgust when we woke the following morning and found that the bed sheets had stains all over them.  If the hotels do nothing else, they should make absolutely certain their housekeeping staff is top notch and that they actually clean a room and change the bedding.  There were also dead insects on the floor of the bathroom.  I now know why this hotel had rooms available while everyone else was sold out."
"1737",5,"We stayed here in early January and I'm already itching to come back when the weather is warmer. This is a beautiful property with a truly lovely rooftop pool and restaurant.

"1740",2,"We were not impressed with this hotel. When we reached our floor, it smelled like mold. The rooms were outdated and the bed was extremely uncomfortable. You could hear EVERYTHING coming from the hallway, so it was extremely loud. On the good side, it was a bonus that the beach was not crowded and that the rooms were very big."
"1741",4,"This hotel reminded us of a 1960's motel. We parked outside our room. Looks like they have finished remodeling and we were very comfortable.

"1752",5,"This hotel was perfect for a girls trip over labor day! For years we'd gone to Ocean City but this year we did not want to get overrun with labor day crowds and we happened to find Chincoteague. It was the perfect choice, even on labor day the traffic was minimal, it was quiet and the beach was not very crowded at all. The hotel is a short 10 minute drive from the beautiful beach so we could go any time. The room was very clean, updated, comfortable and spacious with a gorgeous view of the bay. Swimming in the outdoor pool overlooking the water makes you feel like you are on a tropical island. The staff is incredibly nice, helping us with directions and anything else we needed. It made a huge difference that we could pay a little extra and extend our checkout time to 7pm! We were able to have a whole extra day at the beach before having to pack up and go home, it was great! We are looking forward to our next vacation at the Comfort Suites!"

"1757",4,"The bathtub had scratches on it that shows black rust. The breakfast ends too early (9:00 a.m.), so if you are coming from a wedding party at 2:30 a.m. you can't sleep enough because you have to rush to have b-fast, and if you have kids you are for sure to miss it! Yet, rooms are spacious, TV is new, internet connection is good, and so is the location. Except from B-fast time and tub condition, I liked it."
"1758",5,"If you have traveled down long straight roads for hours and hours and are in need of some rest and comfort with a touch of elegance this is the place for you.

The maids did not clean the room very well. Trash cans were not emptied. Heard they discharged part of the hotel staff. The lobby and breakfast were good.  An older hotel. I think, after this, I will bypass Holiday Inn Express hotels for a while."

"1761",2,"I paid over 190. The pictures looked nice but they were deceptive. The outside looks like a Motel 6. The rooms were nice on the inside with modern decor but the staff was extremely rude. I travel a lot, domestically and internationally. This was a very unique experience in the way I was treated upon arrival. I would not recommend this hotel. I should have either stayed at a bargain hotel or went for it and spent the 400 to stay at a nice place downtown.Melissa R - Please let me start by apologizing to you for your disappointing stay. Our practice is to make sure all our guests feel warm welcome. I would very much like to speak with you, so that I may get more details regarding your experience.

"1762",5,"We were delayed one day due to bad weather and the staff understood completely. This hotel is top quality in every way. The room and breakfast are both terrific. The breakfast included fresh fruit as well as usual favorites."
"1763",2,"The lobby is nicer than a Motel 6 but everything else is Motel 6, well, except the price... Motel 6 costs about 1/4th of the price of the Courtyard Marriott. This Courtyard even has the standard motel polyester comforters (white but still polyester). The staff were nice. I enjoyed my stay at the Courtyard but was expecting more than the... More"

"1768",5,"Bad: Parking. Good: The staff was great did every thing they could to make our stay excellent. The room was very nice."
"1769",5,"Joy! She was there whenever we needed anything and she was so flexible and understanding. She made great suggestions and understood what we needed before we did. That is kind of how the whole hotel worked. Everything was stocked, clean and worked well. You could ask any staff member for something and they made it happen. Breakfast was stocked and the staff members there were quick to clean and help out. I was really blown away by everyone's attitude. No one seemed to be tired of dealing with guests like you see at other hotels. Carlos checked us out and he showed us the same amount of flexibility and the didn't overcharge for things they could have. Also, it's a great location, close to anything you'd need.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

"1770",4,"The hotel was lovely and the staff was great...very helpful with directons around the city. My husband, our adult daughter stayed here for the weekend. The only complaint is that the bed needs to be replaced and the sleep sofa was very short even when fully opened. The bed was very soft which caused us to roll toward the middle. The rooom was very clean and nicely appointed with a good sized flat screen TV. The AC worked well. The best part of this hotel is that if you plan to stay more than a few days, the room comes with a small kitchen that has the basics...dishes, pots, pans,etc. and a dishwasher."
"1771",3,"This place needs a serious reno to stay alive. I booked with Expedia, specifically asked for 3 people in one room. The hotel still charged me 5 bucks extra for that, when we arrived. I think the admin costs of doing that was more than what that 5 bucks covered. Not very smart. We arrived late, around 3:30 AM, and... More"

However my non smoking room reaked of smoke and we found a container of chewing tobacco in the bedside table. My three-year-old also pulled out two 2 x 4 is from underneath the bed. The bathroom was clean."
"1778",5,"This wonderful little motel is a fabulous place to stay. The rooms are cozy and very clean. If you can stand trains, you might want to find another town to stay in. Best not a chain motel I've ever seen."
"1779",5,"I find that Candlewood Suites offers an excellent stay for the price. It is better much than a lot of more expensive hotels. The hotel is always very clean. It offers the best in creature comforts and each room is very well organized for business travel."
"1780",2,"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas."

"1785",5,"The resort and staff are wonderful. The hotel is very nice and the groups are beautiful. The location is secluded so you need a rental car or to book the house car in advance. The concierge staff has not been to most of the spots so use trip advisor to help find the right places."

"1790",4,"Bad: Noise in the morning, the roof top was very small with no music. Good: Very comfortable bed."
"1791",5,"Bad: UnSweetened iced tea would be good. Good: I like the waffles"
"1792",5,"This hotel was a great pic. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and seem to love their jobs. Even the maids had big smiles on their faces. The hotel itself is elegant and cozy, with a great bar and restaurant, nice outdoor courtyard, great pool and outdoor patio area, and small but nice rooms. Comfortable beds. The bathrooms could use more counter space and towel racks, but are clean and updated. Hotel location is great and is within walking distance to everything. The valet parking is expensive (~$29 a day) which is a pet peeve of mine - I think the parking should always be included. However the valet staff is also very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel."
"1793",4,"Great hotel all around. Friendly service, very clean and quiet with a convenient location. Highly recommend!"
"1794",5,"Clean, comfortable and quiet room, convenient shuttle to airport, AND they let me leave my car in their lot while I traveled. Good price, too. Perfect."

"1796",4,"My 18 year old nephew and I recently spent 3 nights at Courtyard-Lake Union. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was especially helpful and friendly. They accommodated a connecting room request (even with a late arrival), helped schedule a whale watching tour and overall very friendly. The rooms were very nice, clean, and well maintained. The surrounding area has a lot of construction currently but other than that the location is great. It is within walking distance of the Space Needle. I would definitely choose this hotel again."
"1797",1,"Never ever again. The rate for this rooms are to high. Dirty old room,smells like an ex smoking room. Keep the doors closed ,Highway behind the Window and Moskitos. Personal is not friendly. Badest Best Western i ever had."
"1798",5,"Good: Sheet came off and I saw coffee stain on mattress cover. Otherwise, great!"
"1799",4,"Bad: Breakfast consisted of too much carbs (i.e. mainly bread, pastries and cakes), with no non-dairy options. Also the inability to use the stairs between floors without getting locked out!. Good: Location was great for the business conference and also shopping. The staff were friendly and always willing to help."
"1800",4,"After a night of fun with work mates. It was nice just to go up to my room and not have to drive. But there was airplane noise in the morning since we are close to airport. But it wasn't too bad."
"1801",5,"The hotel staff was incredibly friendly. They had coffee and tea available in the lobby throughout the day and the night. The included breakfast was different each day and it was quite tasty for a hotel breakfast. I loved the fresh fruit that was in the lobby at all times and the cookies in the evening. Our room was very clean. The only thing I would recommend is that they scrub the hot tub. Although the hotel is not in Newport, it is a straight drive right into the town."
"1802",1,"A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel."

"1807",3,"I've been staying here for many years when I take in the Des Moines Operas at Simpson College in Indianola. This is very convenient to the campus and town in general. Reasonably priced. I usually stay 3 nights. Very convenient to Des Moines also."
"1808",3,"Every night when we came back to the hotel, numerous spots were open. We were delighted. Until we figured out why. It appears that someone designing the spaces are attempting to put as many as possible there, so the spots are very narrow. Even in a midsize car, you cannot park in many of the spots, because someone has parked over the lines, because the spaces are too small. It's like a domino effect. So you can't park unless you want someone dinging your car door. Because of this, we had to find parking very far away from our room. The hotel is very convenient and away from down town. The Old Town Shuttle is a good idea, but it runs only once and hour. It's always packed because of this and the fact that it services four hotels. It was a waste of 20. The rooms were clean, the pool was hot as a sauna, and the breakfast was okay. We would stay again.Dear Phillip H,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Unfortunately Parking on this Island is a hot commodity, but I must agree that some of the spaces do seem narrow. We are also continuing to work on how we can make our shuttle better. I will be share you comments to our team so that we can try to make the correct adjustments. Please feel free to contact my Directly if there is anything that I can do in the future.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manger"
"1809",1,"I've heard such great things about the Chelsea, but their Annex is a dump. It really is. My bathroom was filthy. Neither my bathroom light nor my entryway light worked- we just had to use lamps. The room smelled like smoke or a gross cleaning agent, I couldn't tell. The walls are paper thin- I could hear a casual conversation in the room adjacent to ours. Even the elevator had 3 holes in its walls! Great location to Tropicana, but we won't stay there again."
"1810",4,"Bad: Room was small. Good: Free apples and fruit Infused Water in the lobby. Free bikes."
"1811",4,"Great price for the area. Dated room, but clean. Great wifi, ice machine very full. The continental breakfast consisted of donuts and toast with tang and coffee, but at least it's something. Located about 5 minutes from downtown. Friendly staff. I'd stay again!"

"1813",4,"All was fine, but there was an unpleasant odor in the comforters and new sheets which permeated the room."
"1814",5,"Beautiful hotel! The corner suite is very tech savy and modern! I like the separate living space and bedroom. I also love how everything in the room can be controlled by one device! The monorail also stops here which is a plus! Overall, it can be pricey, but it's worth it!"
"1815",3,"I chose this Microtel because I had stayed here before about eight years ago and it was very nice. At the time it typified a Microtel - clean, efficient, comfortable, modern. This particular Microtel has gone downhill. The wall above the closet was damaged, the tub was worn, and the plumbing under the sink was disgustingly filthy. There are a number of lodging options within a block the next time I need to stay in this area I will use one of them."

Our ocean view room was wonderful and we are looking forward to staying again once the renovation is completed!The rooms were clean, but need some upgrading--But we were only in the room to sleep so it really didn't bother us...The mini fridge came in handy as well as the ABC Market a few steps away.

McDonald's Burger King within 3 minutes walking...Check out the Pacific Hotel for some awesome cuisine and a huge aquarium!Thanks for making our 4th of July fun....Hey, everyone, don't forget to pick up the Entertainment Book for Hawaii...We saved a lot on Parasailing, Hiking, Snorkeling, Restaurants, Pearl Harbor, etc...Great two for one offers! I got mine on Ebay!"
"1822",5,"Bad: Wish there was a hot tub after walking around town all day. The breakfast was a too expensive. Good: Great location! Room was nice and clean, very modern. There was 6 of us and we got the two double beds and pull out couch. We all slept comfortably."
"1823",4,"I really enjoyed my stay the bed was comfortable and All the staff was courteous. The pool area although small was just the right temperture and a really clean area. I felt safe and comfortable during my short stay."

"1825",4,"Great Hotel! The front desk staff was very nice. Just stayed one night while travelling. Couldn't be happier!!"
"1826",4,"The shuttle service was very convenient for concert goers, although the late return must have irritated to driver. He ran red lights, speedings, a little reckless. The hotel could use a coffee shop in the afternoons there only the bar open. It was a good location, Crown Center a block away. The Sheraton needs to get their name on the directories at the Crown Center to find the walkway."
"1827",4,"Except for highway noise, our room was fine. The followup customer service w was exceptional I'd left my purse behind and was 6 hours away when I discovered it missing. Mr Patel went out of his way to get it to me the next day. THANK YOU!"

"1831",2,"Had to change rooms multiple times due to the condition of the rooms, most likely this is a where the not so decent people come to score"
"1832",5,"My stay here was excellent!! Clean rooms great staff. The best part of my stay was Cynthia. She is such a go get her. She will help you with anything you need. Made me feel right at home. That's the kind of service I expect when I stay at any hotel. Thanks again."

"1841",4,"My daughter and I stayed here in February 2016 while we were visiting Duquesne University. It was right off campus and so conveniently located. I would highly recommend this location for a campus visit."
"1842",5,"Neighborhood is quite dicey and not close to anything. The front desk clerk acted like I was bothering him when I checked-in and did not invite us to the complimentary afternoon happy hour or explain breakfast availablilty. The cleaning staff did a very good job when they bothered to show up. The room was beautiful and included full-size fridge, dishwasher, microwave and all the utensils and dishware that we could have needed. Washer and dryer for guest use on 1st floor. DOG friendly!"
"1843",4,"This hotel's people are friendly and helpful, patient with questions, and easy to deal with. The public areas are well-kept and clean. There was nice selection in the complimentary breakfast. The fitness center, while not large, was well-equipped vs. similar size hotels. I will stay there again the next time I am in the area."
"1844",3,"The hotel was alright. The service wasn't bad. The cast restaurant served good food. Kyle at the valet was horrible. I felt ignored by him as I stuck my ticket out for literally 3 minutes, his eyes were glued to his cellphone. Never valet here."
"1845",5,"Front desk very helpful,clean and good breakfast very easy to find just off I 95 Walking distance to restaurant and civic center Room was just what we needed after a long day of driving down I95 Very nice area in SC"
"1846",4,"I expected much less for what I paid, but this place was great. Staff was excellent, good breakfast, able to get my laundry done cheaply, great rom and a great place. This will be first choice next time I'm in this area again."
"1847",5,"Bad: Lots of chlorine in the pool area. Good: I really enjoyed my stay there"
"1848",3,"This is a solid 3 star hotel, the rooms are old and smell like mildew. The air conditioning is loud and drips. If you get a room on the ocean they have good views and a good balcony. The staff was nice at check in. It's not great but not terrible. It's a typical Miami 3 star hotel."
"1849",5,"This hotel was so roomy and spacious. Real espresso available at the cute little breaky bar in the foyer. We felt safest catching a cab to and from town after dark (8) but super easy by day to just catch the monorail. Very close to our favourite museum in the US - music museum"

"1852",5,"Very comfortable and relaxing.... But, most of all the quietness and friendliness of the employees."
"1853",5,"Our stay was nice. The hotel is located not too far away from Mayland live and the Mills mall. If you don't have transportation of your own (as we did not since we were visiting from out of state)the hotel does offer transportation within a 5 mile radius which includes the casino and the airport. The airport is priority for the hotel so if there is an airport trip or pick up, the airport will take priority over the casino or the mall. The casino and airport are not walkable even though you can see the casino from the hotel window as there are no sidewalks all the way. The breakfast is complimentary and is better then we have seen in most hotels. We do advise you to go before 7:30 for the breakfast as it gets crowded down there. The walls are very thin and you can hear the people on the other side of the wall if they are loud. The people on the other side of us were loud until close to 6AM when they finally went to sleep. Since I keep the same hours when I travel as to when I don't, this part was disturbing to me."

"1866",5,"Located directly next to the Space Needle and with all kinds of food options nearby, the Maxwell served as an excellent base for discovering Seatlle. Our room was very spacious, modern and clean and the free parking made for a pleasant surprise.

It also can be challenging due to traffic,... More"
"1872",4,"I was really pleased with the choice I made to stay at this Best Western. I needed a place close to the Pentagon and this hotel was not more than 10 minutes from the Springfield-Arcadia metro stop and right off of route 95 so it was the perfect location! There were plenty of restaurants nearby and the staff at the front desk were extremely nice. The only problem was that our room was right next to the elevator and we were awakened more than once during the nice by some loud guests. Other than that, I was satisfied with everything else including the price."
"1873",5,"The hotel was recently renovated and still has minor renovations going on. Rooms were clean, breakfast was tasty, and the staff members were very friendly. Used the shuttle service to downtown which was very convenient. Will stay again!!"
"1874",5,"Lovely hotel with an amazing rooftop bar. The rooftop bar is on the 17th floor looks out over the city with couches and sitting areas besides a big bar to sit at. Rooms were decorated nicely with a touch of orange as the signature color. Bellmen and concierge were very helpful with good advice for where to go. It's in walking distance of Bourbon St but wear comfortable shoes There is lots of walking and sidewalks are uneven most everywhere you go. Of course, taxis and Uber are available. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. Happy Birthday!!!

Cerca de centros comerciales y frente al hotel la parada del autobus y te lleva hasta el downtown de Baltimore. Y a la estacion del tren. Lo recomiendo, muy buenos precios."
"1881",3,"I had high hopes for this hotel. Yes, it is a 2 star but others give it a good rating. So I thoght this would be a good place to stay. When we first arrived at around 330 pm, the outside of the hotel was well kept so things looked promising. The lobby was clean and smelled nice. When I went to check in there was first a delay because the customer in front of me room was not ready. Then I found out my room wasn't ready. I was asked to leave my so they could call me when it was. They suggested I go drive around until then with gas prices so high. We came back at 5 pm and the room still wasn't ready. We sat in the hot car for another hour before they finally just offered us two single rooms instead of the queen double we prepaid for, stating they sold out of those rooms. We lost a whole day of our vacation simply b/c we weren't able to check-in until nearly 4 hours after the stated time. We didnt get to the beach until late so my kids only got tospend about an hour in the water. Check-out was no better. It was supposed to be at noon, but a male housekeeper came into my room at 1130 without knocking ready to turn the room over. Luckily I wasn't indisposed or anything. Then, the front desk tried to charge me a second time for the room. The room was nice, however. I would have considered staying thre again if those things didn't happen."
"1882",4,"This hotel is very nice. I loved their breakfast. Our room was big and clean. Didn't have any problem."
"1883",5,"Good: Delightfully smoke free! No casino, so much quieter than regular Las Vegas hotels. Just behind The Flamingo, so short walk to monorail, Paris or the strip. The concierge, Spencer, was very helpful in getting back to the motel quickly after our show."

"1889",4,"Bad: Hot tub was very dirty, needed a good wash down and no in house restraunt. The station 10 grill associated with property was good but not located within hotel. Good: We liked the location of the hotel to the activities going on for the week we traveled and it's easy access to beach and boardwalk, breakfast was really good, but gotta get up early to avoid long lines."
"1890",2,"This hotel was awful. It was so noisy you could hear EVERYTHING. Lots and lots and lots of kids running and screaming the entire night. Guess it might be good for a family but unless you have wild children it is not worth it. I heard every car outside. One of our pillows had dirt on it. We booked a king bed and got two queens. It smelled weird. It was dated. An elevator was out so it always took forever to go up or down. The parking was cramped and limited. Save your money and don't waste it on this place.I have stayed at nicer Motel 6's."
"1891",2,"2 things are mandatory for a good hotel stay. 1. that the place is clean, and this was. 2. that the bed be comfortable and this WAS NOT!! It was a struggle to not roll into the divot that was in the center of the mattress. Both my husband and I had a terrible nights sleep."

The issue was that she was all by herself and so many people were checking in.Rooms: excellent,clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable. Amenities were excellent as well.

Saw 1 person from housekeeping in the hall way. I asked for towels, she pointed to her cart down the hall and told me to get my own. Very rude. Also only 1 bench in front for you to be able to go have a cigarette. Could never sit and relax."

"1911",3,"Would rate 3.5 rather than 3.0 stars. Location boosts value. Convenient to Arlington National Cemetery. Shuttle available to Metro Station. Grocery store and restaurants nearby.

Breakfast area on third floor has nice view, but included breakfast average. King suite a little smaller than expectations. Full kitchen nice, but did not use this trip. Additional daily charge for self parking. Overall, a little pricey for condition of property. Might stay again, but will run through all the available options and prices first."

I am employed in the housekeeping field so my standards in cleanliness and neatness go way beyond and my room was neat clean and very nice. I enjoyed the breakfast the hotel offered in the morning. The staff coming in the front door was very welcoming and pleasant. If I could I would stay at this hotel 3-4 days a month. I really didnt want to leave. Thank you for a great stay."
"1919",2,"Rooms were fine, breakfast was fair and reservation were a disaster. Poorly trained reservationist, said room would cost one thing and said he'd call me back after specking with management for rate. He didn't. I called back the next day he quoted me higher rate...said rate had been approved. After fighting for it, an adjustment was made."

"1927",5,"Bad: There was nothing I did not like. Good: Art Deco, location, price, and bed...."
"1928",2,"There was an old, musty smell in the room and the internet did not work. we could only pick up wifi in the hallway. These two components alone are enough to put this hotel at the bottom of my list, but what tops it off is the poor service. The front desk staff does the bare minimum to accommodate guests. It is apparent that they do not care about whether or not we have an enjoyable stay. At check in, we had a question about why our room did not have a microfridge and wanted to know what it would take to get one. The clerk that we initially spoke to was rude and gave us information that the supervisor later informed us was incorrect. The following day we went for breakfast after a morning meeting-- we got there at 930 and it ends at 930, but everything was still set up and the man at the desk was preparing waffles for himself. We went to make waffles as well and he informed us that there was no more mix and because it was 930 they would not restock. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with that policy, but having just watched him fix himself a big plate literally 30seconds earlier, it felt incredibly inconsiderate and cold. Ultimately, if you need to stay here because it is the best option for your paycheck, it may work for you, but do not expect too much in regards to customer service. On the other hand, if you can afford the extra 10-15 dollars it may cost to stay somewhere else, do yourself a favor an stay elsewhere. I am will not return to this hotel."

Good: Location was perfect for our leisure trip. Free valet parking is always amazing (of course we tipped every time we picked up and dropped off our car!) The amount of things to do on the Fremont Experience is endless! What an awesome experience. Truly the 9th island for Hawaiians like us! We love it!"

"1933",3,"Bad and slow WiFi connection"
"1934",4,"Bad: We had a deluxe double room which can accommodate up to 4 persons. We had three adults. The bed was a bit small for 2 persons and we couldn't add one more bed because of fire restriction. Good: I like the clean and simple design of the room. Beds are comfortable and the room is rather spacious. I also like the amenities. The location is also good - Bart station is round the corner and the shopping area is just next door."

I was warmly welcomed by a wonderful front desk clerk named Jennifer who demonstrated exemplary customer service. The hotel was absolutely gorgeous and smelled wonderful - seriously. I stayed in a Jr. Suite and found the room to be comfortable, super clean, and well appointed. My only complaint, and it is relatively small, is that the breakfast buffet wasn't that great especially given the price. When I mentioned this upon check-out I was promptly given a Barnes Noble gift card in an effort to make up for my less than satisfactory restaurant experience. Was I impressed You bet!!!! I have never received such wonderful customer service during any hotel stay as I did at the Hilton Garden Inn.

"1966",5,"Bad: The shower sometimes turned cold and the ironing board was a little too small. Good: The room was very clean and tidy. The location is minutes from south beach and the staff was very friendly even though I only talked to two of them."

"1974",4,"Bad: When I booked my room it said that that parking was included in the price I paid. But when we got there that wasn't the case!."
"1975",5,"I needed an affordable hotel close to Fort Story. The Hampton Inn was perfect. The bed was very comfortable. The toiletries in the bathroom were of high quality, Neutrogena. anytime we needed anything (extra towels, paper plates for the pizza we had delivered, etc.) the staff was quick to help us. And having a hot breakfast with lots of options was great, too. There is an outdoor pool, but I did not use it. There is also a small workout room with a treadmill, an elliptical trainer, and a stationary bike, as well as weights. The neighborhood is very quiet, with a 7-11, Ruby Tuesday's, and a Rite Aid within walking distance. Freeway access was also very easy from there."

"1978",4,"Bad: A lot of the staff had a don't ask me its not my job attitude. At the check in desk personal phone calls had guest waiting 3 to 4 minutes before even responded to.

"1981",4,"For the price this is a well located hotel with spacious rooms with free coffee and breakfast.

"1990",4,"The rooms are comfortable and affordable, but for some reason my account is always screwed up after a stay. I had four charges on my card for some reason. Other than that our stay is always enjoyable."
"1991",5,"This is a nice family owned hotel. It is well appointed but not luxury. The service was exceptional. They could teach a course in hotel service. The staff introduced themselves and remembered our name."
"1992",3,"The room wasn't all that I was led to believe it was. According to Ali, it was the best room in the hotel and it was big and spacious enough to accommodate myself and my 4 friends. I was celebrating my birthday. The location in proximity to the boardwalk was good but the neighborhood was kind of shady. The room itself was pretty big but the beds were small (they were full-sized beds), what hotel still has those It's usually queen or king. With that being said, we were kind of uncomfortable sleeping two to a bed. The room itself didn't get that cool as the air only circulated in the area where the air conditioning was and didn't seem to distribute throughout the entire room.On a positive note, the night clerk, I believe his name was Mahadi was extremely accommodating and attentive and we as a group appreciated that."
"1993",5,"Spent a few nights in Bend and this place was fantastic. The location is right near the Old Mill district on the river which is a great spot.

"1996",5,"This property was delightful in every way -- the perfect place to celebrate my birthday! The decor was unique and our rooms were very comfortable, functional and stylish,. The pool view afforded us a surprisingly quiet stay, particularly given the proximity to Duval Street. Paul and Tripp at the bar were both amazing, each in his own way. They are artists behind the bar, brewing (literally sometimes) concoctions that are different from anything I've ever tasted, but each was really special. And what can I say about Andrew in the kitchen He cooked our tuna and snapper catch in 3 courses, and they were nothing short of magnificent. Again, like nothing I've ever had before. I LOVE this place, and will undoubtedly be back again, hopefully before too long!Thank you so much for your review, we are so delighted your birthday was a success. It tickles me to hear all the great evaluations you have for our staff. I must mention Andrew has this unequivocal desire to please, he lives to see peoples expressions after their first bite. Its good to know we've made a new friend, hope to see you again soon."

"2014",1,"Had a terrible stay. I've stayed in many extended stays across the country and this one has shamed the brand. This hotel smelled, it was unclean, dark and cramped. The rooms were dated,my mattress didn't even have a fitted sheet I saw how nasty and disgusting the conditions of the mattresses. We didn't have any toilet paper in our room upon arrival.the room was less than mediocre. Towels were dingy and worn out. Fire detector was hanging on by a wire literally about to fall off the ceiling. hotel was in bad condition, was more like a motel. Will never stay here again. next time I'll pay more money to stay in a better hotel."
"2015",1,"Everything went well till about 130 am when we were woke from a peaceful sleep of someone trying to enter our room. I went to the door to find another couple who told me we were in their room. Apparently the front desk booked our room twice. We never were able to get back to sleep which was a major problem as I was there for surgery the next morning at John Hopkins. My wife was given a free breakfast ( I was unable to eat due to the surgery) and we were told we would receive a free voucher for a free night in the the future in the mail. As of the writing of this we still have not received anything that was promised. This hotel was the BWI Hilton."

"2021",2,"Hotel is old, in need of updating - especially the carpet, heavily stained. The per night price was too much in comparison to the condition and service for the hotel."
"2022",2,"The hotel is decent but lacks pizazz. Its kind of stuck in the 70's. However its still clean, functional, and a budget friendly place to lay your head for a night or two. Dont expect a lot for what your paying. Your not going to pay much so your not going to get much."
"2023",1,"This thing doesnt have to be called a hotel, this is the worst place ever!!!!!!!!Hygiene is something the hotel doesnt know exsists, you can see food, cigarettes, used condoms and much more just a feet outside your door.Nasty parties during night!! We even had to call the police one night!!!!Just dont go to that place ever!"
"2024",5,"The staff was helpful and friendly. Perfect location, so close to everything!! I would go back in a heart beat! The room I got was off a gated private alley so there was no street noise. In the lobby they have booklets of all the fun things to do in the area."

"2026",3,"I found a large bug in the bathroom, someone else's old coffee filter bag in the coffeemaker, shower curtain bar broken, and on a near freezing night (35 deg low), the heat didn't work, it only made a dangerous sounding electrical noise."
"2027",3,"The location is great, about 10 minutes' walk from Rosslyn Metro. Environment good too. The only thing I dislike is the check in time. Their standard check-in time is 3:00pm, but we actually cannot check-in until 3:40pm. Hotel staff kept telling us it would be 20 or 10 more minutes, but we waited from 1:00pm until 3:40pm. Not a good experience. The room and corridor had cigarette smell, even though we selected Smoke Free room. The blank has a big cut on it. House cleaning lady sometimes left a piece of paper on the floor even though we left 2 dollars as tip. Guess she might not be satified with us. Overall, the place is not a bad selection. I vote for the location and price."
"2028",3,"Hotel was very close to the highway with noise and air conditioning not the greatest in the world."
"2029",5,"The staff makes you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. They are all friendly, efficient and caring. Complimentary breakfast stays open until 10:30. I loved the variety of food and especially the fresh strawberries and raspberries. The 6:00 fresh baked cookies every day are yummy!"

"2033",5,"I recently stayed the night at this motel and I must say this place was better than I expected. The rooms were very clean and very nice. The owner who is a 3rd generation owner treat me very polite. I felt like I was staying with family! He cares about his legacy and does his best to make sure you are safe and comfortable. Thank you."
"2034",5,"The room was very clean and neat and the continental breakfast was good. Our 1Am shuttle driver was very helpful, courteous and loved the music and chat. Could change the courtesy desk height-way to tall."
"2035",5,"I have stayed here several times before. Breakfast is above average with a large area. Employees were very nice. The only complaint I had this time around was the extra soft bed. I felt like I couldn't even sit or lay on the end or sides of the bed without feeling like I was falling off, but that's just my opinion. Still a great place to stay."
"2036",3,"This is a clean hotel.but the smell is not so good, the breakfast is ok."

"2044",5,"We have now visited Bricktown Hotel on several occasions. The service has always been friendly, the shuttle is prompt and service oriented. As a family, we have enjoyed the pool. As a group of friends, we have taken full advantage of the Bricktown nightlife without having to drive. As a businessman, I have used the Hotel as an incentive to employees and as a TE for clients. I have referred many friends who consider this self to be a Gold Mine."
"2045",3,"The sweeper hadnt been ran in our room when we got there. We had to turn AC down to 63 to get it cool in our room. And you had to duck to get under shower head. The mattresses were awful. The sheets were clean.I'm sorry your stay wasn't up to standard. I will work hard to resolve these issues. Thank you for your honest feedback."

"2047",5,"The Hampton Inn exceeded all our expectations. We were traveling to visit family with our daughter and her family. Traveling with little ones can be stressful, but the staff here were very pleasant and accommodating to our needs. I will definitely stay here for our next visit."
"2048",4,"Palo Alto is an expensive area so finding someplace to stay that was reasonable was challenging. Comfort Inn offers a market-competitive value and a consistent stay. I liked that the staff gave me a bottle of water and trail mix upon check-in (easy nice perk), room was clean and comfy. It's off a busy street though so there is... More"
"2049",5,"The Comfort Suite in chincoteague, VA had a sumptuous breakfast, with hot and cold choices, even fresh waffles daily. The room was large and comfortable, the housekeeping staff very on top of their work, and the front desk accomodating and available. The location is perfect - near enough to walk to the shops, near enough to Assateague for a quick beach drive. Lovely for children."
"2050",5,"Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the city. Had other obligations that put us on a short time schedule. Hope to visit again in the future. The location of the hotel was perfect. We were there for a 86 year old Aunt's birthday."

"2054",5,"This Hampton Inn is new and well-appointed, and seems to be a popular choice for people touring wineries, as our group was. There was a little street noise in my room, but tolerable.The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from front desk to housekeeping.Breakfast is of the standard you would expect for this type of hotel, with some reasonable choices and slight changes from day to day.It is not located in the center of Napa, so to go to most restaurants, you need a car."
"2055",3,"A room with a queen-size bed is only 36 including tax. The motel is old, but they do keep it up and the room was clean. Had good WiFi in the room and a ref Microwave. Large well-lit parking area and it is quiet. I will stay here again."

"2058",5,"I stay at a lot of different Marriott properties and this Courtyard was one of the nicest of the Courtyard brand i've stayed at. It has a big lobby with plenty of seating and a dining area for the Bistro that is very nice. The front desk staff was as usual very friendly and accommodating. They had a room ready for me at 10am when I checked in. Starbucks coffee is served at the Bistro and they have a nice food menu as well. The room was immaculate and the bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was nice and cold. The view of the lake was excellent. I happen to be in Seattle on some beautiful weather days. Clear skies and no humidity. If your doing business downtown and need to see Amazon this hotel is a 6 Uber ride. You could walk to some nice restaurants on the lake or take a short taxi ride for 5. I would suggest Uber from the airport as opposed to a taxi. Uber was a 39 ride and the taxi was a 50 ride.Hi Thomas,Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union.

"2067",4,"Bad: The room needs to be updated. The bathroom fixtures needs to be renovated. The layout of the room was a little a awkward, there needs to be better lighting and a vanity under the large mirror. The property itself could use use an update as well, it needs to be modernized. Good: It was close to all the activities on Fremont Street. I enjoyed being in the center of Downtown, everything was within walking distance."

Easy access from the I15 freeway and best is across the street is the LV monorail system. Ample parking. Rooms are large and comfortable. No fee breakfast. In house dining but nothing special so look into... More"
"2071",2,"Bad value for the price. Room was dirty, carpet stained and curtains torn. Breakfast was adequate, well-prepared. Had to report noisy tenants on the floor above, they finally went to sleep or passed out...not certain staff did anything about the problem. Exterior was littered and needed cleaning up."
"2072",5,"Very clean, excellent location in the heart of downtown Lincoln. Have stayed here several times for activities in downtown Lincoln and have always been very pleased. Not huge rooms as Embassy Suites but excellent for a date night. We would highly reccomend especially for Pinnacle Bank concerts."
"2073",5,"Fantastic buy for the money. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised. Breakfast was OK with waffles, sausage, scrambled eggs, etc. The place has been remodeled and updated, but we found the imperfections to be few and small. The travel service to the Metro station was quick, which was very important since we stayed there for 4 days."
"2074",1,"My brother was in the hospital, and I needed to be there for him. Did not want anything problems until this hotel was not very satisfying. The first night, the hotel only took the trash out in my room. So I made a comment to the front desk, is this unusually just to take the trash out. So she made a note to the cleaning dept. The next night my room was not cleaned at all, so you can imagine how upset I was. One night not cleaned, but two nights. When I complaint again, the front desk just told me it's not there problem. It's the cleaning employees so this upset me even more. They did give me some clean towels for that night so I can shower. Also, I felt the breakfast area was not kept up with the cleaning. Very messy. I would not recommend to stay here. But I did have a king size bed, and it was very comfortable."
"2075",5,"My stay at the Red Roof Inn started out with great customer service from John Wehringer. He was very helpful and made sure all my needs were being met. He also took the time to make sure I knew of bad weather coming in that night and the following day to ensure I was prepared for it. The room itself... More"
"2076",4,"Comfortable beds, clean rooms and friendly staff. We missed the continental breakfast but grabbed some fruit and coffee before we left. The pool area is nice for kids with a mini water park. We went down to the hot tub after 10 pm and had the place to ourselves."
"2077",4,"Excellent service. Had a late arrival and checked-in okay. Hotel did a great job with shuttle service for KC Chiefs fan to playoff game in Houston."
"2078",5,"Good: The staff was very accommodating and the beds were very comfortable."
"2079",1,"I stayed at the hotel three nights. I was very disappointed by the level of noise at night. The doors were EXTREMLY loud. I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night. I was on the 25th floor. In addition to the noise, the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved. It wasn't easy. I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again."
"2080",3,"Bad: The breakfast was minimal. The rooms were tiny. There wasn't a workout room. Good: The room location was at the back of the hotel and quiet."
"2081",5,"Went for Thunder Over Louisville 2015. VERY polite and friendly staff and desk crew. Ice makers were broken on 2nd and 3rd floors, but there were personnel on site actively working the problem, so it wasn't so bad. Perfect location in the heart of Downtown Louisville. Would certainly stay again next year!"
"2082",5,"Spent the night after hiking McAfee Knob. The hotel was clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a step above the usual continental breakfast. The location was excellent if you are there for the Blue Ridge Mountains and want easy access to the highway in the morning."
"2083",5,"We stayed here for a friends wedding and fell in Love. The hotel is right on one of the main pedestrian roads and within minutes of all the glory that Vail has to offer. The room was cute, super fluffy and comfortable bed. Tiny windows which made the room a bit dark, but not a big deal. The bathroom was... More"
"2084",1,"I was charged 244 for a one night stay in a very average room, I expected far better for the price sadly this is a similar standard of a holiday inn or days inn who are far cheaper. Staff were friendly enough, reception appeared to be under construction, I shall not be using this Marriott againThank you for your recent comments regarding the hotel. I understand the importance of receiving a value of staying in a downtown hotel, and Im sorry you didnt feel you received that value while staying in the hotel. At this time, the hotel is undergoing a major re-imaging of the lobby space and exterior with additional plans to begin the rooms and fitness area. Once this is completed, I hope you will give us another opportunity so you may see the value of the location and to gain your loyalty. Thank you again for your feedback."
"2085",4,"Good value for money. An unplanned extension of our stay was possible at the same cost."
"2086",3,"I recently stayed at the Suncoast for three nights while working on a project in Las Vegas. The good points about this property are that it has plenty of parking (due to the casino), large rooms, great views from the back of the building, and good housekeeping service. The beds were fairly comfortable (but firm) but the pillows were very hard. Walking into the property however, is like a journey back in time. The decor is dated (brass fixtures everywhere) and the casino, registration, and dining areas are like standing in a chimney. There are so many people smoking in the casino, with so little ventilation, that the smell permeates almost the entire property. After a few minutes, my eyes were burning. Fortunately, the smell did not extend to the rooms (but it did to the hallways). Other negative aspects of the property are the very poor selection of TV channels and the poor set ups for working in the rooms. There is wireless internet but there are no power outlets near the desk or bedside tables. It is obvious that this property survives based on its clientele of older casino patrons. I would stay away unless I had a specific reason to be in this area."
"2087",5,"They should change a carpet in the room plus painting"
"2088",1,"worst hotel ever. do not stay here."
"2089",5,"Staff were exceptionally friendly throughout the resort and the room was beautiful and very comfortable - felt like I was in a 5 star resort. Pools were gorgeous but found the restaurants were a little overpriced for me."
"2090",4,"This is San Francisco in Silicon Valley, so when a hotel charges over 15 per night for internet access you expect a decent connection. Not that I needed to watch movies or do anything particularly heavy - but for work purposes the internet connection was often simply unacceptable. Despite that, the staff were extremely friendly, the room and hotel in... More"
"2091",5,"Bad: No help with area restaurants, attractions or directions."
"2092",3,"Stayed from Monday thru Friday and the last couple days were not very pleasant. Staff is very friendly and I always felt welcomed! Thursday house keeping was awful. I asked for clean bathroom towels everyday and they gave me dirty bathroom towels! They also gave me a dirty pillow case! Had to call the front desk two times. Was told I had to wait to get new clean bathroom towels and pillow cases because they were in the washer. This was at 5pm in the afternoon. Thankfully, Alex who works at the front desk was very nice and brought up new towels and pillow cases. He was also very apologetic. Friday my beds were not fixed and house keeping just dropped the towels off without doing anything in the hotel room."
"2093",5,"Bad: Expensive breakfast. Good: Clean room, comfortable bed, good location (near but not in the Strip) and calm"
"2094",5,"This was an excellent place to stay when I was visiting my son and his family that lives close by.

"2096",4,"This is a great place to stay to sleep. Thats what I was looking for. Staff is friendly. Rooms are clean. Older hotel but updated. Can be loud as this is a motel. I felt very safe. Parking is easy. Good value for the money."
"2097",4,"This hotel is a great stay if you're looking to go into DC. Me and my friend went down at the end of Aug 2010. Although we had to change rooms two times, overall, the experience was good. The first room had the smell of urine so we asked to change. The second room had a roach in it so again we asked to change. We weren't taking any chances because if there is one roach there may be more. Finally, the third room was great. The hotel was conveniently located near the train station, mall, and diner. The hotel shuttle was great also. There were many options during breakfast. We received small gifts from the hotel during our stay such as goody bags and treats. It was really nice to come back after being away from the hotel and find something special left in the room. That was nice. The outside of the hotel was really beautiful. I really enjoyed my experience and think that I would stay there again."
"2098",3,"Stayed here for business for one night. Hotel is clean, bed was comfortable and staff was friendly. Hotel was quiet and quick access to the freeway. There are plenty of fast food places to grab a quick bite. I would stay again for work."

They have four servers for wireless internet but none work in the room we had. We made two calls but they could not resolve it. We stayed in winter. At 7 degrees the cold water... More"
"2100",5,"Excellent location and very comfortable accommodations. Trader Joes was only a couple of blocks away, so it was easy to pick up a few staples for breakfast. This unit had a very efficient use of space for a family of four (two young adults). Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. Definitely recommend this place, but we never answered the phone because we read the warnings about time share pestering."
"2101",3,"This hotel is not up to the Hampton standards. The hotel is clean, but very dated. The furniture, carpet, doors, and woodwork all need updating. The room was clean and the bed a good bed. I typically stay at Hilton properties and was disappointed."
"2102",4,"Bad: The remote in our room did not work for the Television so we had to manually get up and change the channels. There were not as many facilities as we had in previous hotels Oceanfront and the cost was much more expensive then those hotels. The stay was much more convenient at the previous hotels than this one. Swimming pool is to small. . Good: It was very close to the beach within walking distance. Room had balcony so we were able to catch the breeze from the Ocean. Room was clean. Free guest parking. Complimentary Breakfast was great. Whirlpool was place to relax/enjoy as a spa you could say."
"2103",5,"Bad: Was a little too far to walk to the strip. Good: Bartender was awesome got complimentary drinks at bar. Very clean."
"2104",5,"This is such a great hotel! The staff are exceptional and go out of their way to be helpful! A great place to put your feet up to relax. Rooms are clean and spacious! It is close to shopping, restaurants and the airport. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO IS COMING TO FORT MYERS!"
"2105",1,"This place is horrible. Dirty inside and out. Don't stay here, you will regret. The best part was that they refunded me! The photos are of 2 separate rooms.

"2106",2,"Bad: 1st - PARKING LOT **BAD,BAD,BAD** This is 2017, nobody need driver to parking car, unless you're 85 yrs old (should not even drive). But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER. Good: Location, access to shopping, and cleanning"
"2107",4,"the hotel was the lovely. My sister was returning home from deployment in Norfolk via the Naval base. This was in close enough proxmity and was certainly the right price! The staff was very pleasant and helpful. my only complaint is that the hot tub was luke warm at best. other than that, the fitness center was clean, the coffee bar was a nice touch in the lobby, and we even got free cookies (which were delicious!)."
"2108",4,"we had a unknown visitor come into our room at 4:30am. it was strange. how she got in is unknown but when she tryed to get in bed with us my wife escorted her out of our room. very weird experience indeed."
"2109",5,"We were taken aback by the staff, especially Jalan who since we walked in took care of us. We felt like royalty! They secured a bottled of champagne and treats for our 22nd wedding anniversary ... so very kind! The hotel is lovely, a boutique stay with a Hilton flair. Its modern but not over the top. Very clean and very comfortable with a great rooftop bar. It is not in the French Quarter so beware we actually liked that as we know NOLA well. Surely a destination to be considered. Thank you for taking the time to write this wonderful review of your anniversary celebration at our hotel. We love to hear back when we not only meet but exceed expectations. Jalan is certainly a rising star on our staff and has been commended for his efforts in taking great care of you. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and hope to have you back for another visit very soon.Sincerely,"
"2110",5,"Good: It was a very comfortable hotel,everything was was great"
"2111",4,"Hotel is ok. Rooms could be cleaner and smell better. If you are looking for a cool hipster venue...this is it!"
"2112",4,"We chose the place partly part of the bad reviews, we suspected that peoples' complaints might be a little silly and we were right. The room is comfortable, clean, fresh and new. The staff is friendly. Breakfast is nothing to write home about, but it's not important as there's a Denny's right next door."
"2113",5,"New hotel, the rooms the lobby you notice that this is a new building. It was very clean, we enjoyed our room and the lobby.Staff was all friendly and the breakfast was good (usual Hampton Inn breakfast).Dear bens9,Thank you for your raving review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. Great to hear you enjoyed our Hampton breakfast as well as our friendly staff. We hope to see you again on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar."
"2114",4,"Our room was very clean, but the bagel for breakfast was very dry. We went there for new years eve and new years day it was real close to Cincinnati we had a blast would definitely go back to this hotel."
"2115",5,"Bad: The breakfast was good but there could've been more variety to it. Good: The location was amazing! I also liked the fact that the hotel was very cosy."
"2116",5,"Freddy, Jake, Ozzy, and Ally were very good at keeping my friends and I satisfied while we enjoyed the gorgeous view here at the beach. They were ready to work and very enthusiastic during service! I definitely will be coming back and it was an amazing day at the beach!"
"2117",4,"I normally stay at hotels with 3 star and below ratings and every once in a while I stay at hotels with excellent ratings when I want to be in a downtown area. To be honest, I didn't like the room. Coffee maker, drawers, and the closet was dirty. Front desk staff is average. Location is great for food and entertainment."
"2118",4,"Broken AC in room 222 was not repaired for the second day."
"2119",5,"Very nice hotel that was close to everything we needed. Did not have to rent a car but still had a great time, lots to do within walking distance or short bus ride. Rooms were clean and well taken care of during our visit."
"2120",4,"Comfortable room, great rate. I always stay at Hampton Inns. This one had exceptional friendly front desk staff. The location is very convenient from the highway, easy off, easy on. The room was very comfortable. The particular Hampton Inn was showing it's age a bit. The carpets in the hall could use replacing. I wasn't there for the hall though,... More"
"2121",1,"I checked in and this room was literally disgusting. We checked in, and checked back out in 10 minutes. I could never sleep at a place like this. The room smelled of mildew and cigarette smoke. The bedding was stained and not fresh. Please go to another hotel, this one is not worth the hassle."
"2122",5,"Nice hotel and perfect location with easy access to ATL domestic and international terminal. Great staff and facilities. Rooms are spacious and good wifi. Amenities are great for a very reasonable price."
"2123",1,"Filthy outside grounds with construction debris, cat litter, plastic bags, and garbage. Inside lobby was under construction breakfast was in a storage room with no place to eat. Hotel staff was overheard telling others to Shut your mouth. Reception was not manned had to wait 15 minutes for check-in and longer for check-out before staff arrived.."
"2124",1,"Our one night at this roach motel was awful. While the manager on duty was very pleasant, our room was less than satisfactory. There was no remote for the TV. The water in the bathroom ran lukewarm in the shower and sink. Two of our towels were a gross grey color. We asked for a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in our room quite recently. Worst of all, the people on either side of us decide... view mored to stand outside and talk very loudly until midnight. They screamed, yelled, slammed doors, and stomped back and forth for two hours. When we went to check out, there was no one available. We had to leave without being properly checked out. This roach motel is not worth the money."
"2125",5,"Good: Didnt smell like smoke, and no gambling"
"2126",3,"A good basic if not a bit dated hotel for a one night business trip no complaints and a good value for the price."
"2127",5,"Good: Great stay for short stay."
"2128",1,"We stayed in a King Suite for 4 nights over the July 4th weekend. I can hardly express how good and positive our stay was. Breakfast was very good.

"2129",5,"I was only staying one night stay, but have been here for work before, and this place is consistent, good every time. Only thing that could have been better was the heating / air conditioning was a bit loud.... I travel with Ear plugs."
"2130",2,"Check in was quick. Room was clean. About 11pm we called to the front desk for a blanket. 15 minutes later, still not there. We called back to the front desk, to inquire as to the blankets location. We were then told they did not have available staff to bring it up. I went to the front desk to retrieve it. Surprise, 2 people at the desk. The next morning I called for some towels. 20 minutes later, called again. Another 20 minutes, we were sharing towels. They never showed. One of the adults in our party found bed bugs! I went down to the front desk and asked for a manager. He did not want to come out of his room, stating he didn't get back to his room until very late. After some insistance, he showed up. His answer was to give me a 10 gift card to Target. I like most of the Garden Inns we have stayed at. This one will never see me again."
"2131",1,"I was always happy with Hyatt Place customer service, except for the one time I stay at the Lithonia location. My first bad experience came from the front desk staff.

They truly do not know how to run a business and should be... More"
"2136",5,"Bad: Hotel restaurant was good but a bit pricey. Good: Very good value, located across from the beach but several blocks south of the chaos and noise. If arriving by auto, be aware that parking in MB is a problem. Private lots charge 30-40/day. I suggest parking in municipal garages within walking distance for half the cost."

"2149",2,"I was quite disappointed with this hotel. The front desk clerk was rude and put my family in a dirty room (beds were not made, one of the pictures was pulled off of the wall and food still in the room).

I should be getting a refund, but Booking has never replied to my emails. I guess this was my first time and last time using Booking.com. Worst stay ever."

"2166",3,"Clearly this is a popular hotel. One look at the lobby area, the common areas, and your room will tell you this hotel gets lots and lots of use. It looks like it needs some TLC and a face lift. Nothing is dirty, just shabby. Nothing is worn to a fray, just run down. The staff is friendly and efficient but not especially helpful. The furnishings in the room were probably highly functional when installed but now really show their age and overuse. The sofa in my room was stained in many places. The linens were gray from cleaning too many times, the bed a little lumpy from too many nights use without replacement.Not a bad hotel, just not a great hotel either.Dear GoldenBearHusker,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott. We appreciate your candid review of the amenities and services offered at our hotel and we hope to turn your average experience into a superb visit the next time you are in the Orange County area. We apologize for not meetig your expectations on this last stay, but rest assured that we take all of your comments into consideration when looking for ways to improve on the quality and features offered at our hotel.

"2167",5,"Bad: More restaurants. Good: Very friendly staff."
"2168",5,"Everything was excellent and the staff were warm and friendly"
"2169",5,"Nice place to stay. Very quiet. Even with outside temps around 40's the pool area was in the 70's and water was relaxing. and of course those late evening cookies are a nice touch as well. Breakfast was always ready at 6:00 and also has those Breakfasts To-Go-Bags if youre in a hurry."
"2170",5,"The room was very clean and the staff were helpful and super sweet. The manager saw me struggling to fix my sandal and he came to my rescue with super glue and weights to keep my shoe clamped together. Made me feel like Cinderella! Thanks for going above in beyond!"
"2171",3,"For the most part we enjoyed our stay. We thought our room was much bigger as thats how it seemed advertised online and we also thought the lobby area would be bigger. We got stuck on the elevator had to pull the doors open ourselves to exit the elevator on the morning after our first nights stay. The staff was not very communicative about the elevator issues and did not really provide any real direction about updates /or ways to return to our rooms using another means other than the elevator."
"2172",5,"The stay was great. very pleased with the hotel and its accomodations. The pool area and the dual level hot tub...very relaxing. This hotel had everything around it, especially if you have kids to entertain..bowling ally and ice rink in the back, resteraunt next door with very good breakfast and a ice cream shop with a up stairs popular resteraunt within feet from the hotel. Oh, the Lake, just across the street, very, very NICE!!!"
"2173",5,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at XV Beacon. All of the staff was friendly and attentive. The location is perfect for exploring Boston and for anywhere a little further, a driving service is offered. The driver, Mark, was very friendly and made sure to point out notable sites along the drive. The rate is expensive, but we enjoyed the high-level of service with multiple tidy services offered each day. The room was very comfortable for us."
"2174",5,"I visited my old neighborhood for a few days. The clerk recognized me from a previous stay when I checked in. Hotel personnel called a cab twice, with a rapid response. The computer in the business center wasn't working, so they printed my boarding pass at the front desk."
"2175",5,"A little over a week prior I was in SF for another business trip, this time I booked at the IC. I am so glad I did. Service was impeccable, room was clean, spacious and bathroom was perfect! I often eat room service and theirs did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in SF at...

"2176",5,"My hotel stay met my expectations. Just a good night's rest and quite place to stay. Service was good and room was clean. The breakfast meal was well done and food was hot and selections were many. the to go bag was handy for the early departure."
"2177",5,"Everything I needed was provided in a nice comfortable room."
"2178",5,"Bad: The pillows were very flat and uncomfortable, and there was no real blanket on the bed!. Good: Location, staff, aesthetics, price."
"2179",5,"Bad: We liked everything. Good: The beds were comfortable the rooms were clean"
"2180",5,"It was very easy to reach the airport with free transportation and a on site restaurant to get a quick meal early in the am.i"
"2181",5,"Stayed in this hotel last week. The manager and staff were very nice and friendly. The room was clean (even behind stuff), the bed was comfortable, and it was quiet. The hotel offered lots of extras for free such as free hot breakfast, drinks in the evening, hot dinner, and long distance calls. While the food was bland and tastelss, it was there for anyone that did not want to go out for decent tasting food. The bartender poured good drinks and it was a good opportunity to meet some of the other hotel guests and the hotel staff. The manager made it a point to stop at tables and talk to guests and get to know them. All-in-all it was an excellent stay and very good value! The only item that could be considered a complaint was that even with the heat off my room was hot. I had to turn the AC on to get a comfortable temp."
"2182",1,"Spoke with someone in the group reservations department about blocking rooms for a wedding was told I'd get a call back with answers to my questions by the end of the day! Up until that point, the person I spoke with was great.. Then thats where the greatness stopped... We're now 2+ weeks later with no call back, I've... More"
"2183",5,"The rooms are very nice. Large flatscreen TV, kitchen...more like a small apartment than a hotel room. Only bad thing was that it's not super close to restaurants or bars. Other than that though, it's a great deal for the price, and very close to the metro."
"2184",5,"Courteous and helpful staff. Very impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel. It was a little pricey, but comparable to most hotels in the area. The gym was very clean and all of the equipment was very well kept."
"2185",5,"Everything was amazing! The staff was very helpful and professional at all times! It was a very welcoming atmosphere. It is located in a great area where everything(mall, restaurants, aquarium,museum etc) is in walking distance."
"2186",5,"Birthday's, Anniversaries, Guys weekends and family visits all have been celebrated at the Chart House. It all started with my girlfriend and I first visiting there in the mid- nineties and now we take our children and our dog with us. The views are some of the best, balconies are huge and definitely used. We just loved all the boats... More"
"2187",5,"We chose this Best Western because it offered up to 3 weeks free parking with Park-sleep-fly. No other park-sleep-fly option comes close to the hospitality and comfort of this hotel. It is outstanding. The front desk manager was incredibly helpful and courteous and upgraded us to a suite. Upon the recommendation of the front desk staff, we enjoyed an excellent... More"
"2188",3,"Bad: Front desk guy was grumpy at check in. Breakfast was very confusing, half buffet half waited on. Good: Clean convenient location"
"2189",5,"The hotel was very clean, great employees, room perfect size, and pool and hot tub well kept. The location was perfect for shopping and getting around the city. My teenagers love the breakfast bar. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
"2190",2,"Location is great for Metro boarding to DC. No one at the front desk at check-in or check-out. Hallways/stairwells do not smell good at all. Exercise room has no sweat towels or sanitizer towels which we have never seen before. Room was slightly dirty upon arrival. No room service during the stay. Had to ask for extra towels and toilet...

"2191",3,"The facility was very clean and comfortable, but if you're traveling with a pet this might not be the place for you. There is a non refundable 30.00 pet fee and they don't even give you an old bathmat for a dog to sleep on. Lots of pet friendly facilities give you treats or even bowls for the animal to... More"
"2192",2,"Very outdated, terrible water pressure, not enough towels in the room for a couple and the AC was very old and loud. Owner was nice but a 125 a night was way too much. If it was like 75 for the night the rating may have been better. The only reason I did not give this place one star is... More"
"2193",4,"This hotel had great staff. They promptly got us checked in, helped us with information on Napa Valley wineries. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. Bed was very comfortable. Free internet met our needs. Hotel breakfast was vouchers for the Denny's on hotel property. That was nice to have a full breakfast. Property was clean. Our room was quiet (202) with minimal noise from hallway or street. We were able to get good nights rests. Love the microwave and empty frig in the room. Room rate was high due to us being there during an event that this hotel was associated with. So the limited supply and high demand rates were in effect.Katrina,We are glad you enjoyed your stay and it is always good to hear that my staff gave exceptional service. Hope to see you again on your next visit to Napa."
"2194",1,"It was awful We went for one night as we were grieving and needed to get away First of all the 35 parking fee was ridiculous and your parking attendant sneered at us and said This IS La Jolla. Wow. When I asked the front desk what was the deal with the parking it was just uh yeah sorry. The room 808 was just OK. Altjough we were kept awake by some shenanigans going on in The room above us ALL NIGHT We will not be returning and regret we booked this room in our grief. It did nothing to help."
"2195",5,"Our stay was perfect - from the moment we checked in. The staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the happy hour - great selection of wine and snacks. The room was nice - NYC small but had everything we needed. The bathroom had everything - including bubble bath and toothpaste! Who does that We liked the neighborhood - haven't stayed in Chelsea before, but it was a great location. We cabbed it to Broadway for dinner and a show, but also did lots of walking - including up to the Natural History Museum. It was a short stay, but we can't wait to go back to the Maritime Hotel!"
"2196",5,"My wife and I spent three days at the Cub while we hiked in the park. It is off the beaten path and away from the crazy traffic and prices of Gatlinburg. It's like staying at Moms house.

"2199",4,"Nice and close to everything. The staff are very nice, helpful and friendly. We had a room that looked out to the ocean at a distance. Nice heated pool. The only thing I can say wrong about the place is rooms do not have microwave or coffee pots, but they do have small items in the office. Nice and clean... More"
"2200",5,"This is, by far, one of the most beautiful, well-appointed clean places I've ever stayed. The staff was exceptional, polite, helpful and friendly. Brian took extra efforts to ensure our stay was perfect. He even took us on a tour of the other side of the hotel. One side (where I stayed) was very modern while the other side was... More"
"2201",3,"Renovation in progress: strong chlorine smell during stay. My eyes watered throughout this stay."
"2202",2,"The hotel was old but fairly well maintained. I would not call it a 4 star hotel. Our problem had to do with the shuttle pick up after a day of being at Summerfest. We were told that the shuttle would be at the designated pickup area every half hour, so we were there a little before midnight. I decided... More"
"2203",5,"Our son and daughter in law had a great wedding. Venue was excellent. The food was very good. One of the best weddings I've ever attended. The staff was professional and courteous. The wedding planners anticipated every need and made it a pleasant experience."
"2204",4,"Good hotel in the Prince Frederick MD area. The hotel was very well maintained and our room was spotless and comfortable (although the mattresses are on the firmer side). Reasonably priced as well. Having the free breakfast buffet was a plus and a time saver."
"2205",4,"Its well worth what you pay. The pool is the hugest I have seen at a hotel! The staff is polite and friendly. Some kinda shortage of housekeepers and waited two hours on checking into a reserved room. Once there it was good we booked a double with a kitchenette. Spacious and convienient. Will be returning."
"2206",5,"Enjoyed every minute of our stay. Everything is convenient, the food, shopping, and sight seeing activities, I.e.,museums."
"2207",5,"This is a great location for turning in your rental car."
"2208",2,"This facility need to be renovated badly. Its has a lot of problems with the rooms, and management doesn't seem to do anything when told."
"2209",3,"The staff were very friendly and helpful, but the hotel itself is a hit or miss. Upon arrival, the room was very small, crowded, outdated uncomfortable.

"2210",3,"We stayed at the Best Western Dunkirk for a family function. Our rooms was quiet, comfortable and clean. The room was at the end (219) of the building and had an L shape which seemed a little strange. The bed, desk and TV were at the end of the long end of the L. A lounge chair was in the... More"
"2211",4,"It was great. I was just a little disappointed that the local channels would not come through on the tv. I was told a maintenance technician would be up to assist and no one ever showed."
"2212",4,"The location of this hotel is great. It's in a lovely spot on St. Charles and it's very easy to get around with the streetcar stop right outside. It's an older hotel and so you do find some of the issues you would expect...doors that stick, very thin walls, etc. It is very clean, even though you will find some... More"
"2213",5,"We chose this accommodation due to its proximity to several sites. Museum of modern art is 1 minute walk, Space needle 1 minute walk and the monorail is a 1 minute walk.There is also a collection of restaurants and shops an easy 2 minute walk from the HotelWe checked in late, about midnight with friendly and efficient staff.The room has a queen bed with separate kitchen, bathroom and lounge room and is very comfortable.The Hotel has free tea and coffee in the foyer and a happy hour between 4.00pm and 7.00pm every night with US3.00 pints.Breakfast is sufficient with both hot and cold selections buffet style.The free shuttle to a radius of a kilometre was enough to get to Pikes market which was good. When you are ready to return just call and they will collect you from one of the designated pickup pointsI would return to this Hotel if ever back in Seattle"

Smoke is miserable..checking out as I type. Police were in parking lot as I was pulling in. People walking through parking lot heading back to houses in back of hotel..Avoid... More"
"2215",3,"The point of us staying at this hotel was to have safe parking and use their shuttle service to get us to light rail and into the city. The shuttle only was available every half hour, and was full most of the time. We still ended up having to drive into the inner harbor and pay for parking. Not to mention that the hotel booked 4 wedding on one day. All of the wedding guests parked in the parking lot of the Hilton as well as the adjacent hotel, and we circled for hours trying to find parking to no avail. We had to park down the street and hope we didn't get towed. I had gone to the front desk to alert them of the issue. They couldn't be bothered with my issue. However, other guests stated that they were offered free valet, but then had to tip for the service. Definitely not worth the price considering it's no better than a Hampton Inn or something similar in a lower price range. Some of the desk personnel were lovely to deal with, but one in particular was irritated if you spoke to her."
"2216",4,"Good motel, comfortable, enjoyed the hot tub. Friendly staff. Clean. No breakfast. It was a close drive to Mesa Verde National Park. Quiet. It was next door to a good restaurant. It was a close drive to Durango."
"2217",4,"Love the atmosphere at this location. Got a workout in wish the Dumbbells went a little higher in weight stopped at 50lbs. Bar staff was awesome Gretchen was the best. The front desk did great when the shuttle got busy and provided us with a small token when the shuttle could not get to us for dinner."
"2218",5,"Wonderful place right on the Hollywood Beach Broadwalk (spelling is correct). The place has some of the most friendly and helpful hotel staff I've ever encountered, especially the front desk manager, Yolanda. This applies as well to the operations manager, Galina and to the rest of the staff including Elena, Flavia,Nikki,Nikita,Lana and Victor. Harold Miller"
"2219",5,"We had a great stay at the hotel. Very friendly staff and beautiful location just a few blocks back from the main street of shops. Would highly recommend to anyone travelling to Waikiki. I would say that the friendly staff were what made our stay here most enjoyable."
"2220",2,"The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent valueOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future."
"2221",3,"This hotel has a very strange layout and my room and the hallway smelled mildewy. But it seemed very clean otherwise and the staff was very nice. The breakfast buffet was pretty good. The free shuttle to the Metro turned out to cost 10 not sure if the driver and the hotel have that understanding or not."
"2222",5,"Good: Everything with this place is sensational!! alhensadro the waiter has the best guest service we have ever experienced, rooms are clean tidy and beds are very comfortable"
"2223",5,"Great hotel with great proximity to Cambridge and Harvard. Restaurants, services and gym are fantastic. Pricey but generally worth it. Connected to large independent fitness club so no fears of arriving in the morning and finding all the equipment taken. Henrietta's Table restaurant is great for breakfast - either business breakfast or with family."
"2224",5,"Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines. I'll leave that for the next time............................but will be staying at the Kinzie."
"2225",2,"Dear Sir/Madam I arrived closer to 23h00 the first night. I was first assigned Room 421 which after spending some time there realised that the main lights were not working and the toilet appeared to be clogged - also found a sweetener paper wrap in the toilet. I was then assigned Room 418 - none of the lights in main area and then finally got Room 426 well past midnight. The lights kept having to be reset during the course of my stay. The general cleanliness of the rooms was not great."
"2226",2,"My daughter and I stayed for one night. I checked in around 8:00 PM and no one was at the desk and there was no bell or any other way to notify staff we were waiting. After a short wait someone came in from a side office area and checked us in, but made no acknowledgement that we were waiting. Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing. I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on, thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries. I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work. I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power. After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged. The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV. Later that night I saw what looked like a roach crawling on the wall in the bathroom. The bathroom was the size of a small closet where the door had just enough clearance to open before hitting bathtub. There was maybe 3X4 floor space in the bathroom itself. The bed was extremely soft."
"2227",2,"Bad: none."
"2228",4,"Bad: Why didn't I know about Kinzie West That is what you show in your ads, but I got only the highest floor of the Unwest Kinzie. I was expecting a better view of the city."
"2229",5,"I love this hotel. I took a chance on it about two years ago and haven't stopped coming. The hosts are the best. I would recommend this hotel too every one. The restaurants have a good variety of fresh meat and seafood."
"2230",4,"Stayed at Aria for 3 nights in a King Bedroom. Room decor was modern and comfortable. Bed was very nice and comfy. Automated switches and controls for everything.

"2234",4,"Our stay at the Holiday Inn Express was fine. The room was clean and neat, the staff friendly and helpful. I did find the hotel a bit too far from the downtown, although it is on the free shuttle line. When we rented a car we could park it for free at the hotel, which I am told is not always so. There is nothing happening right around the hotel, but it is near a marina."
"2235",3,"When I checked in , I told the front desk manager that we needed a late check out and to please not disturb us in the morning, because my daughter was sick and had to cheer the night before and compete he next day!

"2239",5,"No problems whatsoever. Very nice, clean and comfortable. We visit family in Knoxville from time to time. We will stay here again."
"2240",2,"Stayed hare for a night as all else was full. Staff was friendly and easy check in. Breakfast was very disappointing. Little choice and not fresh. The room to the front was noisy and not clean. Bath room was part of room which made the room damp! Wifi and access to highway easy. Parking ok."
"2241",5,"We got a free upgrade to a room with a jacuzi. It was right in the middle of the bed room... too funny! The beds where fine, the staff was great but the view from the top deck during breakfast....breathtaking!!!! I would go back in a heartbeat!"
"2242",2,"We had difficulty finding this motel. It is closer to Knott's Berry Farm over Disneyland. The check in lobby smelled of urine. The hotel does not have a lift of any sort for the second floor, therefore consider this if climbing stairs is an issue....More"
"2243",4,"Stayed overnight on 4/23/16 with my sister at the hotel and was very pleasantly surprised! The hotel's location was great and the interiors were very stylish. My sister and I stayed in a room with a wonderful view of Trump Tower, Marina City, the Chicago's river and bridges. The room itself, although small, was clean and nicely decorated. Our room had twin beds that were firm but comfortable to sleep on. The hotel was perfect for our needs! We wanted a place to stay near the loop where we could make the most of our weekend downtown. Also, the staff was friendly and the customer service manager that assisted us, Pedro, was very helpful. We plan on coming again in the fall for another weekend downtown and will be staying there again.Dear 216jvs,Thank you for your detailed review of the River Hotel. I am so glad you found the room and staff services to your liking and you were able to enjoy your weekend from our ideal location in the heart of the city.

"2249",3,"We decided to book this hotel for a weekend stay-cation. We are from the Dayton area and knew the miller lane area had plenty of restaurants for our getaway. We have stayed in the south location by the Dayton mall and always enjoy our service, and the room... However, this location seems less organized and not as up kept. The employees parked wherever they wanted, maintenance trucks taking up half the parking lot (not even in spaces) and making it difficult since it was a one way driveway. Also, the bed was VERY hard and uncomfortable, I almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress. Our mirror was cracked, which wouldn't have been a big deal if we didn't have a toddler trying to touch it... And the tub was clogging when we showered. Also, the stove kept randomly turning on.. Yes seriously.. Just clicked on. Our sink faucet had a steady drip as well as the bathroom cold knob did not turn (but the hot water also never got hot)."
"2250",4,"Bad: Very noisy at night (24h party directly below the rooms in the other building, traffic). We didn't stay in the main building, we weren't informed before. So please check before, otherwise there's not much sleep possible. Good: Next to Ocean Drive, so the beach is over the street. Room was huge and clean. Valet parking was very fast (39/d), staff was friendly. Also the roomservice was fast and delicious."

"2257",5,"Enjoyed our stay there. The staff was very friendly. Love taking our 2 dogs with us when we travel"
"2258",3,"Hotel was very clean and room was ready upon arrival."
"2259",5,"I was a little worried upon driving up to the hotel, as the outside looked a bit rundown. Upon entering however, it was like stepping back in time. Absolutely beautiful lobby area! Staff were very attentive and helpful. Room was very nice as well. Restaurant (Envoy) had the best brunch I've ever had -- they do small plates instead of... More"
"2260",3,"Bad: Beds are creaky, thin walls you can hear everything from the room next door and hallway. Housekeeping isnt consistent. Laundry delivery to the wrong room. Good: Location"
"2261",5,"Good: Great location and nice facilities. Large clean rooms and the staff were very helpful. Would have no problem staying here again."
"2262",5,"Right off I-95, Newly renovated, very clean rooms- you can smell the fresh paint. The Staff are helpful and friendly, they allow pets, which is hard to find. Continental breakfast including waffles!!!! The new coffee machine they have is spectacular and makes a nice robust coffee, unlike all other watery hotel coffees. Ruby Tuesdays right next door to make it... More"
"2263",5,"Certainly not a 5 star, but a GREAT value for the Price. Friendly Staff and Comfortable room. No extras but the Bed is comfortable and the Room is Clean. Great Weekly Rate and Pet Friendly. Not a Single Complaint."
"2264",5,"Hotel and staff were exceptional. Check in and check out were a breeze. The bedding was comfortable after a long day of travel. The breakfast was hot and delicious and included choice of eggs, bacon, oatmeal, waffle, choice of pastries and beverages. The room and bathroom were tidy. I will definitely return."
"2265",1,"I requested a non smoking room. When I opened my door I could smell heavy scent is stale cigarettes and alcohol. Every thing in the room seemed dingy. So much so I had to go to the local grocery store and buy sanitation wipes.and come back clean my room. The AC did not work well at all. The next morning I go down to the breakfast and there is the front desk in the dining area yelling at a couple because they were eating there. And then he goes and gets another female employee and she goes over and starts yelling at them. Granted the couple were not guests of the hotel. But everyone knows you should put on a professional face at all times. The could have asked them quietly to follow them out. Then after work I returned to my room to find that the maids and come in but didn't even replace the towels. This is the worst experience at a hotel I have ever had. I will not be returning, and I do travel to DC about every other month for business. And this hotel will permanently be marked off my list. Needs a total face lift and brand new well trained staff. I would wipe it clean and start with a brand new clean slate... With everything."
"2266",5,"Good: The receptionist Sean was excellent and informative. Housekeeping are good."
"2267",5,"We stayed only 1 night having a very late flight. The staff was extremely helpful. Our room was very nice and comfortable. Breakfast was really good. Lots of free parking. Great location. Would stay again."
"2268",4,"The lodge has the basic amenities. TV, Bathroom. Bed and small coffee pot. It was sufficient for the most part. My husband and I would of liked a small fridge or somewhere we could store some ice. The grounds of the lodge, were beautiful!

"2269",5,"Bad: Used my credit card to hold reservation but was going to pay cash. When I checked out they said they already processed my credit card and would not refund it and l could not pay cash. I am from Canada and have a US bank account so when the Can and US dollars were at par I put my travel money into it. By paying with my credit card, I ended up paying an extra 150 in exchange rate and user fees. They also charged my credit card the day I booked- which I didn't know until my statement came in. Good: beds were very comfortable. breakfast in hallway every morning very convenient. location was good-very close to river and a couple of blocks from metro stations. Staff very friendly."
"2270",5,"Me and my wife stayed here while on a weekend trip. Our main reason for coming to the area was to visit Charlotte Motor Speedway for the Bank of America 500. This is the best place we have ever stayed at while vacationing. Thank you for a great experience!"
"2271",5,"This Hotel was amazing. My husband and I came here for one night to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. The staff was very accommodating and let us check in early. Andrew the front desk guy was awesome and sent us a bottle of champagne after I told him why we were here. The room was nice and spacious and the shower is on another level. There are lots of restaurants near by and places to walk to. The light rail is right next to the hotel so it was super easy to get to the restaurants and bars further downtown. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Andrew for making our stay amazing!Hello Amanda D, We thought you were pretty amazing too! I'll definitely share your accolades with the rest of the team. We hope you can try our restaurant, MATCH Restaurant and Lounge next time you stay. We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!"

"2274",5,"The Saint Hotel in Key West is by far the very best boutique hotel on the island. The staff is beyond amazing - gracious and accommodating in every manner. Thank you for making every day a great day!The hotel and grounds are spotless, the pool area is an amazing place to totally unwind and relax. The music is perfect, and the sounds of the waterfall really set you up for a great day in the sun of Key West!My room was beautifully appointed with marble floors, modern furnishings, and a large marble bath. House keeping and turn down service was exceptional as well.I would compare The Saint to a 1,000 a night boutique hotel in South Beach - the vibe is cool, and you will not find it anywhere else in Key West!After staying here for a week, I HIGHLY recommend The Saint and can tell you this is the ONLY hotel in Key West that I will be staying at in the future - it can't be beat!Thank you for choosing The Saint Hotel and for the amazing review. Being a new hotel we depend on our reviews and we appreciate the wonderful words. We'll see you next time you're in Key West."

"2294",4,"We stayed at this hotel for the St Patrick's Day Dash in Seattle due to its location. It is a nice hotel, right across the Space Needle. We stayed in a suite... it actually had a full kitchen! Including dishwasher, microwave, garbage disposal, etc... Perfect for a family staying for a few days. Our room was facing other rooms, so when you open your blinds, you will see all the other rooms... kinda creppy, so beware and request a room facing out to the street.The hotel server a hot breakfast and it was actually pretty good. Supervised me how good it was, I even went back for seconds. Hotel has parking... but spaces are very limited and very small.... so leave the Ford350 at home.All in all... excellent hotel and an excellent location.FMH60878,Thank you for taking the time to submit such pleasant comments about us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

"2302",3,"Facility was in good shape and clean. A little awkward to get to. NO ELEVATOR! The room was spacious. Having said that some of that space should have been invested in the bathroom.

"2310",3,"I stayed at this hotel in mid October. It has changes names since apparently. It is now known as a Motel 6. Online, when I booked through a company, it said that breakfast was included. It is not included anymore, that was a bummer. The location is good. The room itself is basic, but wasn't too bad. Especially for the... More"
"2311",5,"Driving through and location was perfect. Hotel was very clean, bed was comfortable, rooms were quiet, breakfast was fresh and well maintained. Fitness room was the best I have been in yet at a hotel. Would totally stay here again."
"2312",3,"One of our rooms was above a restaurant/bar/lounge which was playing very loud music for several hours after midnight. The noise from the bar kept me awake for hours. As you can imagine, this made for a most undesirable stay. In addition, the temperature in the rooms was very cold and the beds had only a thin blanket on them. There were no extra blankets in the rooms and there was not a thermostat in the rooms that would have allowed us to control the temperature."
"2313",4,"What a cool property. If you like Route 66, you will love this place. Classic basic terrazzo floors in the lobby that you'll find after you locate the dark street entrance to the back parking lot off of Eads. I circled twice thinking there must be a service road to the front entrance. The framed picture in the lobby confirms... More"
"2314",5,"It was a very lovely stay. The room was so beautiful! Beds so comfy!! Pool was so refreshing!! We will stay again! The thing that was troubling, was check-in with one person, part of information was not correct, when I mentioned this, she stated, well you are staying only one night, Let that go, she did mention it several times. Then was telling us, where the room was, kept pointing behind us and saying right back there, repeating it. We didn't look behind us, so she kept pointing, I said do you want us to look behind us to see where you are pointing Eye roll from her! Breakfast ends at 9 and don't take any food out of that area! Let it go. The best part was she informed us of check out, which was 10, not one minute after, repeated it and do we understand! My patience now about gone, about to ask for a manager and tell her a piece of my mind! My very calm my daughter, who is more patience then I just said thank you and took the keys from her. Walked away, went to our room, went to eat and a dip in the pool, let it that go! The night gentlemen, at your front desk was fabulous, the mini fridge started making noise, and sent someone up. We went to eat the pool, it was looked at it. To bad, that the noise had stop, so we both thought it was fixed. When I said something to the front desk (not same lady) that next morning, she said so very sorry and took the resort fee off. The stay was so very nice, had a beautiful garden area!!! Will stay again!!"
"2315",2,"The only good thing about this hotel is the proximity to Kings Dominion. I will be driving to the park next time. The hotel is right next to the highway, which for me is a security concern. The staff was not overly friendly. The room is a bed and shower, not overly nice, or clean. If you are looking for a place to sleep and shower only (not your most comfortable stay) OR cannot afford a nicer hotel this is the place for you. Although the attached Denny's is convenient, it is dirty and we were served cold food. Hope this helps make your decision."
"2316",4,"This Hotel was much better than expected after reading some of the negative reviews here. I was incredibly pleased with the room, the staff, and the location. The room was fairly modern with 2 perfect double beds. The bathroom and shower were perfect. The Hotel is a 5 minute drive to downtown Napa and about 10-15 minutes to the Silverado Trail. The hotel provided breakfast coupons to Denny's which is directly next door and was perfect for us - I had a healthy egg-white and fruit breakfast while my travel companions gorged themselves on Denny's Grand Slam. I would definitely return here for its cleanliness, staff, and proximity to everywhere I wanted to be.I am glad we surpassed your expectations. We pride ourselves on our clean well appointed rooms and our customer service. Thanks for the review and we will see you on your next visit."
"2317",4,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Best Western Twin Islands. The room was comfortable and at a great location within Gatlinburg. I would have enjoyed more breakfast options like bagels or made already made oatmeal with additional add-ins."
"2318",4,"We stayed overnight before catching a flight out. The hotel was much nicer than we expected, the staff was friendly and our room had a living area and small kitchenette. The rooms were well insulated from noise. They had a nice happy hour (free drinks for guests from 5-7) and a MADE TO ORDER complimentary breakfast that were both great. I would not recommend the steakhouse located in the building. The food was decent, but overpriced and lacking in quality. The hotel also has a shuttle leaving for the airport every half hour. It made for a really nice stay for two weary travelers."
"2319",4,"Comfortable, clean and attractive as expected. Very comfortable bed. Had ALL conveniences we look for...exterior corridors with parking at our room, wash basin outside toilet/shower area, micro and fridge and table with 2 chairs to eat at while watching news on tv."
"2320",3,"We do Portland weekends several times a year and we've had great experiences in all the hotels that we've stayed in. A friend recommended the Benson, so we decided to give it a try. Gorgeous lobby, very friendly and efficient front desk staff, good-sized room (Junior King Suite), and a comfortable bed. The room was very beige, which isn't a... More"
"2321",4,"This was a business trip and I found the hotel occupied by business people as well as families. Staff was very friendly and accommodating, on all shifts. Bed was comfortable. My room was taken care of nicely except for one day when the bed was not made (I didn't mention it to the desk clerk). Breakfast was set up late every day (after 7 a.m. although the sign says 7:00 and I was told it is actually 6 to 6:30 and all the hot items required microwaving, so early birds can't really eat and run. It was impossible to control the heat, cool and humidity in the room but I understand a renovation is scheduled so I imagine that will correct that situation. Price was right. Overall, I would stay in this property again."
"2322",4,"We made plans last minute so we were worried if this place would be nice. We were very happy with our experience! We were 1 hour early for check-in but the staff said it was okay. Check in was quick and fast. We parked across the street at the garage. Rooms were clean, we had requested top floor which they accommodated! View was PERFECT! Exactly what we wanted! Rooms are a bit dated like the carpet and the bathroom but very clean and plenty of towels. Room had a flat screen TV which we never even turned on because there was so much to do! Free hot breakfast was great the next morning. The staff is EXCEPTIONAL! Very friendly, they always smile. Very efficient! Every time we needed something, they went out of their way to meet our needs. I will definitely visit again just because of the family friendly atmosphere and the super attentive staff!"
"2323",5,"Bad: We had the bad luck of staying in a room next to a suite. Our neighbors partied until 5 am. Good: Room and common areas were very nice."
"2324",5,"First time staying at a My Place hotel..room was wonderful, large and clean. Beds were very comfortable. Loved the kitchenette with the full sized fridge. Check in was quick and the staff were very friendly. Will definately stay here again.."
"2325",4,"Bad: Provided breakfast is just bagels and doughnuts + tea/coffee. I'm not sure how that qualifies as continental! Beds are very small but OK for a relatively small couple - would be uncomfortable if you are much over 6 feet. Rooms are small but that's the only way you are getting a room at this price in this location. Good: Location is excellent (we walked everywhere including from Boston Back Bay station to the hotel with our bags - it's a 10min walk), staff were friendly, rooms are small but reasonably well appointed, hotel and rooms were very clean."
"2326",5,"The suite was very spacious and the amenities were good. The living room has comfortable chairs, a roomy couch/convertible bed, and an adequate dining area. The bedroom made sleeping easy and pleasurable. Although the hotel's fitness room is sparse the pool and spa are delightful with its glass ceiling and walls providing great views of the surrounding foliage. I also enjoyed the complementary full breakfast with eggs made to order. I will definitely return to this hotel."
"2327",1,"No desk or desk chair. No Internet except for rooms close to office. Air conditioner very loud. Uncomfortable bed."
"2328",5,"Good: reasonable choice of breakfast items."
"2329",5,"Have not stopped at a Drury Inn in quite a while. The last time we did was not a good experience. But because of the reviews decided to give Drury another chance. Glad we did. Do not hesitate to stop at this hotel."
"2330",4,"Bad: The neighbourhood is a little seedy, but understand that is part of the city's charm!. Good: Enjoyed our stay at Zetta."
"2331",4,"Staff was very friendly, but fan in the bathroom didn't work and the beds were very firm. Perkin's breakfast vouchers were a nice added bonus!"
"2332",2,"There was much to be desired. Air cond. didn't work well. No cups in bathroom. The housekeeping employees woke us up. we were not ready to get up before 8 A.M."
"2333",1,"Bad: Rude staff. Cleaniness. Bed. Had to change rooms three times. I will never stay there again!. Good: Nothing"
"2334",4,"We had a great stay at this hotel! Our room had everything that we needed including coffee pot, microwave and fridge. It was a very clean room and the hotel had a pleasant staff. This hotel is only about 5 minutes from the mall and numerous other stores and restaurants, so very accommodating! I would definitely stay here again!!"
"2335",5,"My husband and I stayed one night here for our 40th anniversary. Lovely hotel and amenities! The lady that checked us in was so friendly and welcoming. I think her name was Cherry Lyn Our room was a large suite with a super comfy king sized bed. Their breakfast room was big and amazing with a great selection! Starbucks was... More"
"2336",3,"For the price, the hotel was satisfactory. However, we had an extremely long wait at night for the shuttle van a the nearby Metro rail station despite giving more than 15 minutes (the requested amount of time) notice and making repeated followup calls. Also, the lone elevator was out of order throughout our 3-evening stay - making checking in and checking out more difficult."
"2337",4,"Nice clean hotel, undergoing some renovations. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast was good , many choices such as waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage and gravy as well as yogurt and hot food was hot. They had great recommendations for local restaurants, Our favorite was the Monkey Town Brewery."
"2338",2,"I called the Ramada the morning I was checking in to verify the check in time as well as verify that the room type I requested would be available, I was assured it would be. When I arrived a few hours later, the room type was unavailable. They also had a sign posted indicating the water would be off until 3:30pm. I should have received some sort of notification or gotten some sort of compensation for this considering the water was not back on until 5:45 or so. When I turned the faucet on the water was brown and disgusting - I certainly was not going to get ice or regular water from this establishment.Wi-Fi was incredibly spotty. No password, less than ZERO security. Disappointed."
"2339",5,"The hotel was very clean and the staff was great! My friends and I booked this hotel for my birthday trip and we would definitely stay again. It's near the heart of the city, The French Quarters, and neatly hidden at the same time.Thank you for sharing and Happy Birthday! No better place to spend it then the Big Easy and we appreciate you allowing us to be part of it. Thank you again! Wayne General Manager"
"2340",4,"This Four Points proved a good choice for my quick, two night stay in Columbus. Staff was friendly, room was clean, and the price was reasonable. The building appears to be relatively new.

"2349",4,"If you're familiar with Key West, you'll recognize the location as the old Day's Inn. But the changes are more than just the signage. I figured it would be a new sign and fresh paint. Not so. A number of years back, numerous hotels on the entry end of the island were taken out of the inventory for revitalization, including the Days Inn. They gutted it, and the changes are significant.The room was large, as was the bath. Just a shower, no tub in room 148, which was fine. Bed was comfy, a/c worked great. In fact, I had no complaints at all about this property. The complimentary breakfast included pork sausage, turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets, make your own waffles, plus pastries and fresh fruit. Not your typical complimentary breakfast.Pool is large enough, and plenty of lounges, as well as canopies. There's a Tiki Bar and music playing. Now for what may be a concern for some.The hotel is at the entry to the island. All traffic on or off the island passes through the intersection out front. Since the hospital is on Stock Island (just next to Key West) ambulances going there, pass right by. Sirens don't bother me, but if you get upset over them....well, since the island is 2 miles by 4 miles, maybe this isn't the place for you. There were numerous sirens from law enforcement, fire, and ambulances each day, but I didn't notice them at night.I had no complaints about this place. The only shortfalls, were that there was only one wastebasket in the room, which was next to the computer desk. Another in the bath would have been nice. Also, the parking spaces were a bit narrow, but nothing I couldn't deal with.Front desk and all staff were great. Property gets a recommended!Please note: There are two Fairfield Inns on the island. One at 2400 N. Roosevelt, and this one at 3800.Thank you for the very detailed review. We truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with our readers. Glad to hear you had time to enjoy our breakfast and enjoy some sun poolside. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Keys Collection!"
"2350",1,"Woke up to many red, itchy bites all over my body. I'm so disgusted. Front counter guy was very rude noisy children laughing talking in the middle of the night. Stayed in room 223 in the bed closest to the window, so If you have to stay here-- make sure it's not in that room."
"2351",4,"We always have a positive experience at Saratoga Springs. The Congress Park section of the resort is within easy walking distance of Disney Springs (formerly Downtown Disney) and even closer now with a new pedestrian bridge. Additionally, there is a little used entrance off Buena Vista drive that makes for easy in/out near hotel row."
"2352",4,"Clean room. Great price at 162 a night. Two beds offset so our son was out of the way while sleeping. Clean rooms and refurbished. Close to Disneyland. And my son said he caught a Charmander in Pokemon so he's happy. Great hotel for the price and proximity to Disneyland."
"2353",1,"Coffee Pot Leaks and does not make HOT coffee. Had to request Toilet Paper TWICE. NOT the Worst we've stayed but FAR FROM THE BEST for that price."
"2354",5,"My stay here was awesome. Stayed here to break up my journey and got a good night's rest. Really friendly staff."
"2355",3,"The room was not bad, but the couch was so worn we practically sat on the floor. It was also pretty stained. The bedspread was also very worn and starting to get holes in it. The beds were kinda hard. It did have 2 full bathrooms and a full kitchen including dish washer!!! I felt safe and the room was easy to find. Map quest did put us at the back of the hotel though, and it was kind of confusing to get up to the front office. Overall it wasn't bad. It was clean. It just needs a few furniture updates."
"2356",4,"It seems like the hotel is still undergoing renovations and that everything is not quite finished yet. However, I think it will be nice once finished. They do have more modern furnishings in the room like plasma tv, and computer hookups."
"2357",5,"Friendly and helpful staff. GM was training and teaching staff when I arrived. Check in by Samantha was quick and painless. The room was new and comfortable. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Cheers!"
"2358",3,"Front desk weren't well informed about payment - I usually pay when I check out but they wanted the cash up front before I was even finished checking in."
"2359",5,"The hotel offers nice spacious rooms. If you have a room on a higher floor you will have great views around the city. The staff is very friendly and efficient. The internet works well and is fast. The wellness area consists of a very well equipped gym, a large pool and a jacuzzi. You also have a terrace with sunbeds... More"

"2370",5,"We loved our room at Wyndham Canterbury! It included a small kitchenette with a dining table, a sitting area, and a separate bedroom.

"2373",5,"the staff very helpful and accommodating throughout the entire stay, breakfast was excellent and rooms were clean. pool was nice and clean and environment as a whole was very comfortable in feeling. location was close to much activities to participate in"
"2374",4,"The hotel was very conviently located and close to several restaurants. It was also close to the highway and an historical village. The staff was very nice and helpful and called our room to verify our comfort."
"2375",5,"The hotel is fully functional. I like the fact there are no hallways, as you enter the rooms from the outside. Parking is plentiful. The pool wasn't filled and that was a bummer. The lady at the desk upon check in was pretty snippy. The gal working the desk the next morning was awesome. The restaurant, Bailey's, was worth the stay alone. The food was amazing. The room wasn't perfect. But there were plenty of channels to watch, and the soft water was nice. The bed was big and comfy. There were a couple parts of the room that weren't the cleanest and the exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work. All in all I stand behind this place being a good choice if you're looking to stay in Norfolk. Don't give the Hampton all your money. Stay here instead."
"2376",5,"Love this clean new modern hotel ! The front desk crew is simply awesome professional and very caring ! They go out of their way to make sure I had a fresh made salad for a late bite. These gentleman are just simple the best across the country hands down !"

"2379",1,"very lousy front desk"
"2380",5,"The staff were so helpful, the breakfast was delicious, and the beds were very comfortable!"
"2381",3,"I was really disappointed that they didn't clean my room (includes making my bed and providing fresh towels) one of the days. Everything else was great. The bed was very comfortable and the rooms are very nice. Need to improve the service a bit."
"2382",1,"Front desk attendant wasn't available on arrival. Had to call her to open the door to let me into the hotel itself- that was a first for me. Then she proceed to be rude through out the check in process. AC was loud as a lawn mover. Kept me up all night. Worst one night stay ever. Big nope."
"2383",4,"The hotel was beautiful and although it has only been there 8 months I was very pleased with my stay. I felt the hotel was understaffed the weekend I was there which caused check in to be delayed and my room was not ready when I arrived."

Shower needs a grab bar to help older and/or mobility challenged guests in and out. A!so, the discounted rate was clearly reflected in our room location. Less than pleasant view, near hotel HVAC equipment which burped and gurgled 24/7, and door to room 5 steps from ice and vending machines."
"2387",3,"Bad: We parked our car in the hotel parking and the second day we realized that somebody had broken in. Somehow we didn't find Las Vegas a safe place to travel. Solely for leisure, I will not return to US again. Not value for money. Good: It was one of the cheapest places we found in Las Vegas during those days."

"2391",1,"terrible terrible..... a guard was rude and nasty. Worst hotel stay of my life, and on my daughter's wedding."
"2392",4,"I did like this hotel but found the room quite small it was listed as Suites but was smaller than most regular Inns. They had the most helpful people of our whole trip every one was friendly and helpful. We visited the DDay Memorial while here it was a very moving sight."
"2393",4,"The Embassy Suites Crystal City is a nice hotel, the closest one to the Pentagon. They will drive you to the Pentagon in their shuttle but you have to walk across the whole parking lot to get to the entrance. If it is raining or snowing that might be a uncomfortable walk. The walk to the Metro is the longest in Crystal City but still not too bad, about 5 blocks. Their shuttle is great, they will drop you off to restaurants or the metro, but you might have to wait a bit to get a ride. My only issue are they do not have enough smoking rooms - they always say they are full and they have plenty of rooms and floors to add smoking rooms and it is pricy - but that is to be expected in DC."
"2394",5,"We stayed here 3 nights in March while on a week long trip of Hawaii. It was wonderful in every way. When you enter the lobby, the backdrop is an open air view of the Ocean. It is magnificent. Breakfast is delicious and the service beyond terrific. We sat over looking the Ocean and saw whales on two mornings. Nothing... More"
"2395",4,"We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff the shuttle service was fantastic! Only a couple of minutes away from a Metro Station the hotel provides regular service to/from every 30 minutes or on demand. Very nice buffet breakfast. Hotel room was clean very comfortable. We will definitely be back."
"2396",4,"You can't beat this hotel because it is right on the beach. It is mid beach so away from the hectic and trashy south beach vibe. If you want to escape the incessant pounding music and Kardashian wannabes of the SOuth Beach hotels and neighboring Eden Roc of Fountainbleau then this is a great option. But also don't expect the service of any of these adjacent properties. THe service here is minimal at best. You wait forever at breakfast if you order off the menu. The doormen are non existent as is a concierge. THere is no room service and the food is mediocre. Terrible service out by the pool with a limited menu. No beach chairs - you have to pay an outside vendor. The bathroom was so tiny we could open the door less than halfway because it hit the toilet. Two people trying to use it was like a circus maneuver. It can't possibly be code. There are plastic cups for drinking - no glass but the bed was comfy and the flat screen TV was great. THe staff is not that helpful and the balcony's seem old and in need of paint. We had a gorgeous view but the balconies are interconnected with a rail between them. Our neighbor chain smoked on his balcony which made sitting out extremely unpleasant. That said if you get a good price is really worth it because it is on the beach and that is why I went to Miami Beach in the first place."
"2397",4,"I would definitely return to this hotel. Friendly staff. Clean rooms. The check in service was great. Comfortable beds. Free happy hour with snacks. Affordable. Nice restaurant within short walking distance."

"2403",3,"The room was fine, with two exceptions: I was placed in a room adjacent to the elevator shafts, and the wall air conditioning unit was excessively noisy. Consequently, even with ear plugs, it was not easy to get a good night's sleep for me. The A/C unit was easy to turn off, but it would have been difficult to prevent guests from using the elevators!"
"2404",5,"We enjoyed staying at The London. Service was excellent. Our room was large and beautiful with a sweet balcony that was actually usable. The buffer breakfast was very nice. We thought it exceeded the cost in every way. We will definitely return."

The rooms (or caboose, if you will), were clean and very comfortable.... More"
"2406",5,"The only reason I rated the condition a little low is because there was a loose screw in the bathroom threshold that could hurt someones bare foot."
"2407",5,"First time in New Orleans, planned to stay here for 3 nights but ended up staying for 5. Mainly because he owners, Lauren and Daniel are such excellent hosts. Great advice on where to go and what to do, nothing better than a local to give you advice. The hotel was quiet when we were there so Lauren and Daniel sat with us a breakfast and helped us plan our day. Rooms spotlessly clean. All of their suggestions were spot on. Good little pool with sun deck, unusual for a BB. We visited the WW11 museum which is outstanding but allow at least 4 hours for your visit. Burboun St was a disappointment, but go to Frenchman St for great music and food. Try 30/90o bar for music. Highly recommended and within walking distance, is the Lounge (best ribs ever). Another reviewer spoke of the area, we drove down from Houston and arrived about 6pm, we were slightly concerned as the area has some building with a lot of graffiti on them, however they are being developed and the owners said the area has changed a great deal over the last few years, and is becoming one of NO sought after places to live. Its abut a 5/10 minute trip by uber/taxi into the French quarter. Altogether a great place to stay and would highly recommend."

"2409",5,"Bad: I understand it is a japanese hotel but the American breakfast was terrible. I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant."
"2410",4,"I like this place, even though it is a 30-minute commute to my work location, but the shuttle to Metro is convenient. This time one of the elevators was out of service with a note that it would be fixed the Monday of my arrival, but it was still out of commission when I left. The only drawback is the breakfast. One day, they added some sausage patties to the steamer table and it was actually cold--not even room temperature. It should have been heated first, because it appeared to be leftover from another day (and not just 1 day ago because the day before they had links, not patties). The last day, there wasn't even really meat. They had eggs, potatoes and grits along with corned beef hash, which is more of a potato entree--not a meat entree. For someone like myself, who doesn't eat potatoes, there was essentially no meat. Hopefully in the future, there will be plain meat--either bacon or sausage. I would not hesitate to come back here in the future."

"2412",5,"Get away to enjoy family yet relax with the sights and sound of surf."
"2413",1,"We stayed July 11, 2005. Room 627. Room was in terrible shape: cigarette burns in the carpet, upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty. We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach. Sixth floor, no less. Called front desk: We're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room. Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party. I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer. I replied that I thought I was a customer too, only to be told: Have a nice night. Last time for us at a Drury."
"2414",4,"Nice menu of american cuisine. Steaks, pasta, salads, chicken. Rueben and sweet potato fries were very good. Onion rings a little greasy. Chile very good. Nice crowd with families. Recommended. We will probably stop again."

We dined there for dinner... More"
"2416",5,"I have to say this hotel more than fit the bill for my five night stay in Phoenix. The valets were always very helpful and prompt (one of them was a hoot). The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Two of the ladies (one in the morning and one in the evening) always asked about my day and were impressed with everything I had been to see. My room was spacious and the bathroom was a bit strange in its layout (sink extends from outside into the shower area), but it grew on me. They gave me plenty of pillows and the bed was comfy My only issue is that the walls are a little thin (or it could have been the connecting doors), cause I could hear my neighbors very clearly a few times. The hotel is located right near US-10 and is in walking distance of the Phoenix Art Museum and the northern part of downtown. Sad to leave but overall a great stay.Hi jehenson81!Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I'll definitely share you accolades with the rest of the team. I know they'll be thrilled to hear your kind words. I'll also share your feedback about the rooms with connecting doors with our design team.

"2420",5,"We stayed here end of July 2015. We picked the room here because it was central to some places we were going on vacation. I don't know why this was rated at a 2!! If you want a 5 star hotel then book a five star hotel! Hotel was very clean and updated. Free breakfast was excellent. Pool was nice. Room was great. Only downside was beds weren't the greatest. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Can't beat the price and get all that anywhere else. Was a small hotel which was fine for us. Made it that much more homey.

"2441",3,"The reviews on this Best Western are all over the range of scores, but we all stayed at the same motel. Go figure! This is a basic services motel in an upscale county (Napa). Don't come here expecting frills and fancy decor. And what's wrong with eating breakfast at Dennys We used the coupons and our breakfast cost about 2 plus tip. If you are here to tour the wine country there are probably better places to stay. If you are just looking for a place in Napa to spend a night or two please give this place your consideration. We arrived here on our way to Sonoma County and needed a place to stay for 1 night. The Best Western suited our needs. Our room was clean and the furniture was in good shape. I can't speak to the ammenities since we just used the Best Western as a place to sleep, clean up and hit the road."

"2447",4,"We arrived by chance at the St.Regis after the Waldorf failed to provide us with an updated room. The St. Regis was very beautifully appointed and the front desk staff was very accommodating as well. We needed a larger room as we were having guests joins us for dessert and drinks and although there was an additional charge 1,000 more for the room, it was just what we needed and really pretty. The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark. If you book a room at the St. Regis, make sure to ask for a high floor or you will be in darkness, despite the wonderful dcor and amenities.Dear Dirwpgops, Thank you for taking the time to detail your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your larger room but are dissapointed that you were not pleased with the view. Should you ever encounter this again, kindly contact our Front Desk team to see if we have alternative options for you. Thank you again and we hope to see you again soon.With warm regards,Pedro RodriguezDirector of Front Office"

We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

"2455",5,"This was a last minute booking. You walk into clean hotel that doesn't smell like smoke. Staff was great and checked us in along with explaining the times for breakfast buffet, wifi access and other necessities. Room was big and clean.

"2461",5,"As I mentioned previously we enjoyed our stay at Hotel Red. This has probably been our 10th time we have selected Hotel Red for our Madison lodging. Hotel Red offers a unique boutique hotel experience versus the mundane chain hotels."
"2462",4,"Overall this is a very nice hotel with well appointed suites. We were in town for a couple of family functions so we didn't use most of what was available in either the room or the other facilities that were offered by the hotel. A couple of comments an not really complaints are that the fitted sheet on the bed was put on the bed inside out and was not fitted very well to the mattress (it just looked kind of sloppy) and there were spatter marks on the wall next to the bed that looked like they could have easily been wiped away. The rest of the room appeared to be very clean. They were even steam cleaning the carpets in the hallways while we were there. All of the staff was very friendly. Each of the housekeepers we met in the hall always gave us a friendly greeting. The breakfast offered a good variety and everything seemed fresh. A buffet meal is offered Monday through Thursday but we were not there on those days to be able to comment other than to say what was on the monthly menu posted in the room looked pretty good. The hotel is close to the airport , about 10 minutes to Virginia Beach Town Center, and only a 15 minute drive to Virginia Beach. It is located in an industrial park and is conveniently located near numerous dining and shopping facilities."

"2476",5,"Free parking ! Very clean room and hotel. Friendly staff. We will definitely stay here again."
"2477",5,"Having a full kitchen is a great feature and breakfast included is a nice way to start the day. Our room was close to the office and that worked out well for us.

The hotel shuttle was very reliable, running in the morning afternoon Mon-Fri to from the Metro station once a day to the supermarket. The suites were large, with a pull-out sofa in every room. It wasn't the most comfortable, but it was great to have a separate bedroom area full kitchen. The only thing I was suprised at was the fact that we had to lift our heavy luggage up about 5 steps to get to the elevators. There were no ramps. From the parking lot, it's a straight shot through the front doors of the main entrance. I saw some people arrive by bus, which dropped them off on a side street. They were dragging their luggage up about 30 stairs to get to the parking lot! Instead, they could've just walked around along the street in front of the hotel to get to the lot. Going up all those stairs with luggage did not look fun!"

"2494",5,"We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu."

"2505",4,"Room 116 was a nice sized room with a couch and a king bed. The only downside was that it was basement level. Our window looked out to the knees of passer-by's which meant that we had to keep the blinds closed or people would look down into our room. Zero privacy. Otherwise the hotel was nice and the staff did a good job. No complaints."

"2510",5,"This was a convenient place to stay and then ride the Metro (only 1 mile walk) into DC to see the sights. The quality and value of the hotel were outstanding. I loved having a suite, it made us feel at home. The housekeeping staff was awesome. I called and requested extra towels and coffee and they brought them within 5 minutes."

Considering it was very warm outside. All was clean in the room and bathroom. The stay was overall comfortable pleasant...at a great convenient and affordable rate per night. I have no complaints."
"2512",5,"Bad: Timing seemed to be off. Had to wait a very long time for breakfast, longer than people who had come in after us. Had to wait a very long time for the valet to bring our car, seemed to be some kind of communication issue. They were nice about it, and so were we, but it seemed to be a theme, which was a bit of a disappointment. Good: Nicely appointed room, great location."

"2516",3,"Well, on a whole the room was clean and the bed was comfortable but the fitted top sheet kept coming off on both sides of our bed. The TV was very good, it had a frig and microwave which we always appreciate. The room was 122 and I could hear the traffic (hubby sleeps with ear plugs), I had to keep the fan on the air conditioner on to drown out the noise. WiFi was great. Breakfast, we grabbed a couple bananas, coffee and left as it was really sparse."

I had my confirmation email in hand but the hotel clerk would only tell me she didn't have anything and said I needed to contact the Hotels.com. I think that I would have rated this hotel higher if perhaps she had offered to call them for my seeing as how I had my confirmation email in my hand and it would have just been that extra customer service effort. I did contact Hotels.com and they resent my reservation and the hotel upgraded me to suite for the inconvenience. There was no apology from the hotel which I thought would have been appropriate. My hotel key kept getting deactivated because my cell phone would get too close to it so that was a hassle, having to take it to the front desk to get activated. My room had a slight odor in it but after a day or so I didn't notice it. Overall my room was clean and it was quiet. It suited my needs but wasn't anything extraordinary or spectacular."
"2528",5,"I stayed at this Motel 6, 311 Courtland St NE, Atlanta, GA, in August last year for a conference my job would not fund. I was totally on my own dime and so needed to economize. What a great deal this place was! The conference hotel was the Hilton literally next door, and those poor schmucks over there were paying over three times what I paid! For the same location! My room at the Motel 6 was clean, the bed was comfortable, the parking was FREE, AND I had a small balcony off my room on the 2nd floor! The staff was nice - what I saw of them. Granted, the staff at Motel 6 is small - there is no room service, no restaurant, and no bar at Motel 6. But they have all that at the Hilton next door and all over downtown Atlanta so Motel 6 doesn't need it!!! I will stay at this Motel 6 every time I have to go to Atlanta from now on. The location is perfect. I felt as safe as anywhere else I have stayed in Atlanta. What a sweet deal!"

Everyone is very friendly. Rooms are modern and comfortable. Nice shower. The bed was a tiny bit too soft for my liking, but it didn't tarnish my experience in the least.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us as we appreciate hearing how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. Sounds like our rooms and staff exceeded expectations which is our ultimate goal and know that our team will be commended for their efforts. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and we look forward to having you stay with us again.Best regards,"

"2535",4,"Bad: The hotel bathroom should be remodeled as the bathtub looks quite old. The drain gets clogged easily, and the basin tap handle looks like it is about to fall apart. No free WiFi. No fridge. And even no coffee-maker/kettle. Good: Good location with a few minutes walk to the Mob museum. The hotel is located in the heart of Fremont Experience. Both northbound and southbound bus stops are just beside the hotel building. Besides, the staffs are quite friendly. The buffet was satisfactory, and the price is cheap due to the 10 off for guests every meal."
"2536",5,"NYLO was such a fun experience. The entire place feels like you are in NYC. The rooms are clean, modern, and resemble a loft. NYLO is tucked quietly away within a short distance from the shops at legacy and tons of restaurants. When I'm in the area again I will be staying here. Super friendly staff as well."
"2537",2,"Upon check in our room was not ready. It was a non-smoking room, yet guests prior to us had been smoking inside the room. There was a cigarette butt in the corner of the room that house keeping missed. There was an inch between the outside door and the wall allowing bugs inside of the room. There were not enough wash cloths inside of the room for guests. The next morning my daughter fell in the bathroom in the lobby and hit her chin and hurt her wrist. The day of check out my daughter had hit her toe on the concrete car stop, causing us to go into the ER. The hotel overall was loud and dirty. Upkeep was poor. Poor lighting. We could have paid the same price for a hotel room at a Disney property!"
"2538",4,"In the event you are trying to beat Atlanta traffic for one night, staying at a Hampton Inn by Hilton is the perfect choice. It gave me the opportunity to get to doing a important personal task without worries about think about my normal long commute."
"2539",4,"Bad: Shower didn't drain propery, was puddle in shower when we checked in. Someone else's shower water left over, very gross. Good: Very friendly staff."
"2540",5,"This hotel is in a great location and very roomy. Many of the rooms have a patio where you can enjoy coffee in the morning or a cocktail in the afternoon. There is a nice bar and restaurant on site and walking RANDALL Statium is a cross the street."
"2541",5,"We stayed here when going to Pittsburgh for an event at Duquesne University. We love this hotel because of its proximity to Duquesne and downtown. The rooms are clean, large, and have wonderful views. The staff are always welcoming and friendly. We will continue to stay here whenever we visit Pittsburgh!"
"2542",5,"This resort is worth every one of its five diamonds! Stunning service with kindness, support and upgrades when any question came up. Ex. When I called the operator to find out the opening time of Jean Phillipe, she said, they opened 30 minutes ago, Mr. G---, they are waiting for you...--absolute magic."
"2543",5,"My husband and I had a relaxing time. Our room was overlooking the ocean. The room was spotless and the staff is very cordial and accommodating. The hotel is close to downtown so you have access to shops and restaurants. We will definitely return to SeaCrest!"

The hallways had a heavy smoke smell, and then my room had a heavy perfume smell. What were they trying to cover up To top it off, the walls are paper thin. Not... More"
"2549",5,"stayed here the weekend of the Rock and Roll New Orleans marathon. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was gorgeous, comfortable rooms and huge bathrooms. My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. :)We appreciate that you took a moment to share your experience. I'm very excited to hear you were so impressed during your trip to the Big Easy! We always strive to exceed the expectations of our guests and I'm proud to be working with such a great team. Thank you for recognizing all their efforts. We look forward to seeing you again for next years marathon if not sooner, the Crescent City is coming up soon!Thank youWayne General Manager"
"2550",3,"This place needs updating. The room had a foul odor. Sink wasn't working properly. While we were away during the second day, the staff emptied out the refrigerator. Don't know why they did this as our stay was for 3 days. Completely unacceptable. Will not stay there again."

"2563",4,"Great location in Crystal City - near the Airport and Metro. No car necessary to see DC. Hotel is comfortable for families and quite affordable compared to others, especially if you need more than one room with kids. Breakfast buffet is convenient and nightly reception is nice as well. The pool is small but adequate. Staff was very friendly and accommodating."
"2564",5,"Short walk to conference at Minute Made Park, hotel being renovated and I was in a new room that was small but perfect for my needs with a Queen bed, desk and swivel chair, comfortable arm chair, good size shower in adequate size bathroom.

"2568",5,"A few miles west of I-75. Near restaurants and mall. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean. Hotel appeared to be fairly new. We had a king bedded room with sofa bed. For this area a car is needed."
"2569",3,"The housekeepers were so loud that when taking a nap with my do not disturb sign out, they were yelling outside often door so loudly that I heard them over the hum of the heater and tv on low that I had on to ironically drown out noise. When I called to complain that the housekeepers were yelling Down the hall at each other, the staff just laughed and said sorry. Also- upon check out- there were there cop cars at the hotel and one cop at the front desk discussing an incident. Didn't make me feel safe."
"2570",4,"The hotel has seen better days, but certainly a step up from the low-end chains. Didn't try pool, but fitness equip was fairly rickety. Good restaurants nearby, and good value for the area. Overall pleased."

See you again soon, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"2579",5,"Staff was very friendly and helpful. I couldn't ask for better service. The 24hr coffee/tea stations was wonderful (used it a lot)!

"2588",3,"The room was adequate but not anything else. I stayed here because it was the only room I could get because of a Jazz Fest at the Hampton Coliseum. The rate was about 2.5 times the regular room rate definitely not worth the price, but I had no choice."

"2597",4,"For the price, definitely worth it. And, other than the Petit Jean lodge and cabins (which probably have to be booked WAY in advance), it's the only place convenient to the park, so for that reason alone, I would stay there again, for sure."
"2598",5,"We stayed in the 3 bedroom suite and it was gorgeous. We were on the second floor in the first tower overlooking the pools and the ocean. It was beyond my expectations.

"2606",2,"the rooms ac was leaking causing the floor to be wet around the window and ac. the hair dryer and phone didnt work. the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night. the sheets had crumbs and sparkles on them. Maintenance fixed the problems but its ridiculous they dont inspect their products."
"2607",4,"We stayed here because we needed a room that would sleep 6 people at a decent price. Upon arrival, the front desk staff were friendly...even though they tried to charge my card twice. They were always willing to help whenever the need arose though. The housekeeping staff were quite the contrary. If you needed anything outside the ordinary, they seemed bothered or afraid they were going to get in trouble from management. The room was dated but was comfortable. All ammenities worked as advertised and the room was similar to the pictures. The restaurant (Tradewinds) provided above average food at an affordable price. The pool was large enough for a large number of people but wasn't cleaned during our stay. (4 Days) It was open 24 hours though, which was nice as we arrived late the first night and did activities during the day/evening. Being off of the boardwalk provided a quiet experience which was nice. Also, there is a Food Lion directly across the street which we used to stock our cabinets and refrigerator. The beach was clean and also had a lit volleyball court after dark. My overall experience is as title states."
"2608",5,"Nice location in a newer area (Eastside of Naples, just off I-75) that was quiet and surprisingly clean and comfortable. I felt the 3 star rating was below the value we received. Cordial staff, very clean and complimentary breakfast was real food! Nice."

"2617",4,"On a two day layover to see my grandkids I stayed here in one of the King suites. I had originally booked a different cheaper hotel (Country Inn) but when I walked in to check on the rooms I decided to look for something else that also had an indoor pool since the CI suites had no window in the Living area. The space there was also very small. I am so glad that I then found the Drury Inn!! The atmosphere in the hotel was perfect for us. Friendly staff!! Yes the rooms were older but they are well equipped, very large and very comfortable. They are not at all nasty in any way so I do not understand the complaints from others. For the price you just cannot beat this hotel!! Lots of food - breakfast with lots of choices, snack in the afternoon (popcorn and free soda) and a food bar in the evening including FREE drinks. Simple foods but VERY acceptable! WE ALL HAD A FUN TIME HERE. The tween grandids really enjoyed the HEATED POOL. This was also a convenient enough location to make a midday trip to the fabulous Aquarium too. We did have a problem with our neighbor smoking in their room although this is clearly stated on signes throughout the hotel that this is a NON SMOKING HOTEL . Since the vents are connected in the rooms we were smelling the smoke. Both the grandkids are allergic to smoke and it really hurts my sinuses too. The staff moved us to our choice of a new room (not sure why the exhaust vents in hotels are now connected but just saw that in a Hilton I stayed in recently too). I will certainly stay here again on a quick layover to Atlanta. + FREE PARKING and FREE WIFI too!"

"2623",4,"I was impressed with this property. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. Location was very convenient to many restaurants and attractions. I would recommend this property to anyone wanting to check out downtown Chattanooga. The only downside was the parking garage, it was a little inconvenient when carrying luggage."

She said she would take care of the problem. Unfortunately, she did not bring the refrigerator or move us to another room. We should have at least had our room charge reduced, but t no avail. I told the hostess when I gave my keys about the problems, all she said was, I'm sorry.. Good: Location, proximity to US 60 and downtown Williamsburg"

I stayed with my son and daughtger in a studio suite and were very comfortable. the hotel is located ina excellent location with easy acess to all surrondings. I would stay they again,"
"2633",5,"Good: The breakfast was good and the bedroom was comfortable.It was within walking distance of the freedom trail.There was also a shuttle bus to the airport within walking distance."
"2634",1,"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution.

The staff was helpful and friendly, housekeeping did a great job and the breakfast staff was great. I couldn't have asked for a better stay!Thank you for your review of the Hampton Inn in Gloucester. We are delighted that your stay was so pleasant. Looking forward to your return!"
"2636",4,"This hotel, though not new, is very well kept up. The bed is very comfortable and the property is clean and well kept. The location is good. I needed to be in Apache Junction early Saturday morning. I was only a 30 minute drive away. I will recommend this hotel to anyone I know. The breakfast was nutrisious and hot.... More"
"2637",1,"Terrible. I spent my last penny reserving my room and i didn't see anything about a deposit under the small print tab, so I thought I was all paid up. Suddenly, after having spent nearly half an hour checking-in with their highly unprofessional staff just before I was given my keys so I could go find my room, the room keys didn't work on my room. So I walked all the way to the lobby, this time with my bags in tow, only to find out that they deactivated my room keys because they weren't able to charge card for incidentals. Which is when I said, of course not...I spent my last penny reserving this place online and there was no mention of a deposit in your 'small print' tab online. Every room I've reserved through Hotels.com, that has charged me a deposit, mentioned a deposit or incidentals charge in their small tab. Well I cancelled my reservation and asked for my money back so I could rent another room elsewhere. The manager cancelled my reservation and stated that he would be refunding my money, but he never did. I was not able to rent another room...I was broke."
"2638",5,"Lovely Motel on the lake - and in the evening we came back to find the fire-pit was a blaze - so we sat and watched the sunset over the lake and drank a few beers - perfect! The room was nice enough. A bit small - but fine for the night. The town of Speculator is a lovely little... More"
"2639",5,"Bad: Not much. Good: For several years, a group of us has met for the SEMA SHOW. We have always come over a day early, and met for fun and dinner at your 777 Microbrewery. This time we were booked at MAIN STREET STATION as well.We'll be back, particularly since you didn't charge resort fees."
"2640",5,"For the rate it was an amazing stay! Would definitely recommend to my friends!"
"2641",5,"6 friends on a very short break completely blown over by The Aria. Everything very efficient from start to finish during our stay.Location perfect. Rooms huge and spotless with fantastic views-only downside was the pillows-too soft for my liking. We asked for rooms near to each other and this request was easily met. The lobby areas very clean, casino not... More"
"2642",5,"sehr gut gelegenes Hotel."
"2643",5,"We stayed for 5 nights, and we were extremely pleased. It's not a new building, but it is well maintained. What we were most pleased about was the breakfast buffet! It was a true buffet (not just pre-wrapped pastries)--Eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, waffles, cereal, fruit, bagels, toast, etc. This saved us a lot of money, because we could start the day with a hearty meal. Additionally, Stacy at the front desk was very helpful with all kinds of information. I highly recommend this hotel! We hope to stay there again in August."
"2644",5,"Super clean and spacious room, comfortable beds. Extremely nice/friendly/helpful owner/managers. Be sure to ask about dining recommendations -- we had the best dinner (Sergio's for Mexican food) and breakfast (Nibbley's Cafe) based upon their suggestions. Also, very reasonable rates!"
"2645",4,"The room was very clean and the staff at the front desk was wonderful/helpful! Nice to have a hot breakfast option too!"
"2646",3,"The front desk staff was very helpful, called a cab and helped with questions. The shuttle to/from the airport was good. The hotel was very cramped in all ways including the rooms. Had to pay for just about everything including printing and even coffee. Walls were thin. Location was pretty ugly, looking out on a yard full of parked buses.... More"
"2647",5,"We found Indigo through searching on Trip Advisor. We were looking for a unique, boutique type hotel with competitive rates. We loved this hotel! It was definitely competitively priced and significantly cheaper than the big flags downtown. But the value is amazing! Big, spacious rooms an enormous, wonderful shower comfortable bedding clean throughout warm and friendly staff great breakfasts (complimentary)... More"
"2648",5,"Bad: Too pricy, very basic for what you pay for. Good: Nice staff, good continental breakfast included. Excellent location."
"2649",1,"Mold in bathroom. Blankets had fur balls (old). Klennex box rusted. AC loud. The property had old decor. Will not be returning to the property. I will not be returning to Red Roof Inn. If this is how they run their inns I will stay somewhere else."
"2650",2,"After finding the comforter was stained my husband asked the front desk for another blanket and they gave us one. It appeared that a lot of people actually live at the hotel."
"2651",5,"Bad: There is handicap parking for checking in but not close after checking in. Good: Everything was convenient and costs of the buffet were not bad. Prices in the restaurant were affordable."
"2652",4,"The Hotel Maya is a fun experience! Not only was the staff very friendly, but the accommodations were excellent, the service was on point and the room was fresh, clean and quiet. And the best part You get a cookie! I highly recommend this place!"
"2653",4,"Decent hotel. Nothing fancy. Just the basics. Even the casino area is quite small and only has basic games and machines. If you need a clean room to just sleep in. This is the place. If you need excitement. Then this is not the place for you."
"2654",3,"We stayed here because the price was right. Location was ok, just a quick walk to Fred Meyers the bus stop. Staff was very friendly. Room was tiny and old but clean, which matters the most. No a/c which might be ok on the other side but we were on the side facing the sun and it was quite... More"
"2655",3,"Agree with previous review, renovation consisted of mostly new paint. No fault of hotel, but be prepared for a night with plenty of noise....street cars passing all night!! Food at restaurants is excellent. Employees are very nice. If you are looking for a really first class hotel at this price point, I would suggest Ritz Carlton, Windsor Court, Roosevelt. One... More"
"2656",4,"The room was a bit expensive for what it was, but the location is convenient if you're going for a Dodgers game, it's clean, and there's plenty of space in the rooms. I would stay again."
"2657",3,"Chose this hotel because we were sharing the 2 bedroom/ 2 bath unit with elderly parents who were to fly in from DFW area. Bad weather cancelled their flight two days in a row. I called the morning after we checked in to explain situation. We wanted to see if we could get smaller room since it was just the two of us instead of four. Stayed on hold for sometime waiting for manager to get on phone. We were unable to change room because we had booked through Hotels.com."
"2658",5,"Great stay but if you don't have a car, your cab around would be 15 to the mall"
"2659",4,"This was a good choice. It was on the edge of the plaza so we were able to walk. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was immaculate and well appointed. Though we only took advantage of the complimentary breakfast one morning, it was very good. We will use this hotel again when we go back this spring."
"2660",3,"Decent hotel. Not dirty. Simple. Good part of strip."
"2661",2,"Bad: Cleanliness of entire place Asked for room with view of harbor and got other side. Not many people there so not sure why. Parking securities. Good: Location People were very pleasant and helpful."
"2662",5,"After reading the reviews I decided to stay here after arriving from a lengthy series of flights and was not disappointed. Comfortable, clean and spacious room. Friendly and helpful front desk staff. Quiet location enabled a good nights sleep which was much needed. Great value."
"2663",4,"This is a great hotel in a quite spot, walking distance to downtown Cedar Rapids. The interior is dated but clean, same with the rooms. Plenty of free parking."
"2664",5,"What a pleasant surprise! The cottages were neat and clean and perfect for our family of 5. We were toasty warm even when the temps dipped to -28 (-43 with the windchill) at night. There is a full sized oven, stove and fridge with plenty of space to fit whatever food and snacks you need to bring. The shower was... More"
"2665",5,"I was a little worried by some of the reviews I read that stated the staff was rude and the hotel was in disrepair but the price was amazing so we went ahead and booked....and I'm SO GLAD WE DID!! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (and I'm from the South, so I know friendly.) The hotel has normal wear and tear, but was very clean and nicely furnished. Some people may not like that the microwave and fridge are extra (would have been nice to have but we wouldn't have used either so it didn't bother us). Beds are very comfortable and rooms are large enough to lounge in the evenings after a long day. The free shuttle service was great. The Metro (subway) is farther away than listed. The site stated 1/4 mi, but it's closer to 3/4 or 1mi. We had no problem walking it during the day. If this is your first visit, be sure to ask specifically where the shuttle will pick up. We were on the wrong side and missed it the first time. If you exit the Metro up the escalators, go out and to the left up the steps to where there are several bus stops. If you exit to the right near the greyhound stop (and a several story parking garage), you're on the wrong side. The shuttle drivers were very nice and happy to give directions and tips. Once you're on the Metro, a 20min ride gets you into the city. Definitely worth it to save hundreds on a hotel room. There are several restaurants right outside the hotel and several more within 1/4-1/2mi walk. There are also some smaller shopping places if you forget any necessities. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return if we're ever back in the DC area."
"2666",4,"I stayed at this hotel in February as part of a business trip. Overall, I found this hotel to be quite good for a Hilton Garden Inn. It's a large-sized hotel, and recently built so the rooms and common areas are in great shape. The hotel staff is very friendly, and while breakfast is an additional cost, I found the... More"
"2667",3,"Had planned a family trip well in advance. Made reservation through hotels.com. Knew hotel would be full - called the evening of reservation to let them know we were about an hour out. Front desk staff was rude, said I did not reserve with charge card and was ready to give my room away - I insisted she check records. she then admitted she was wrong and the room was already paid for. Upon arrival, nobody at the front desk - had to wait. understaffed for such a busy night. once in our room, discovered they gave us a king bed for 3 adults - had to go track down a cot since there was no other room to switch to. staff was short with me and my family. said we should have known to call the front desk when making the reservation, etc. etc - pretty much blaming us for not doing a better job with making reservations. Hotel is in decline with repairs needed (broken door locks, broken gym equipment, broken machine in breakfast area, clogged toilet, broken clock in gym, filter not working in pool adequately, etc.) Housekeeping had rooms clean, but common areas needed more attention. Towels in gym and pool area were low in stock. staff in breakfast area was very attentive and pleasant. Seems more staffing/attention to detail would generally bring things back up to snuff. It is close to traffic - and right next to a fire station. Ask for a room in the back if you can!"
"2668",4,"Have always enjoyed staying here (clean, quiet and good breakfast), but the last few times there has always been a maintenance issue. This time the stool did not work properly and did not have hot water in the morning. Couple of times have had to switch rooms because of leaking water problems. Was great but seems to keep having problems."
"2669",5,"Bar wasn't open very long. Great location. Loved the spread at the bar at happy hour as well as drink tokens."
"2670",5,"My brother and I had the pleasure of staying at this property this past weekend, while in town for a college graduation. The hotel is well maintained and an overall great value for the price. Also the ladies at the front desk were very personable and gave us a warm and friendly welcome. The perks of this hotel include: -Free... More"
"2671",4,"Stayed for a total of eight days. Rooms spacious and updated recently. Everything in working order. A/C a bit noisy, but working fine. Overall, Hotel is showing its age here and there, but it is good value for the price. As stated in previous reviews, they do have the slowest elevator in the world (but it is working). The guest...

"2672",4,"This is our second time to algoma beach. we love it. So clean. Quite. Friendly staff. Great value. Having the lake as our view just amazing. Will come back for sure. Only 45mins from Lambeau field for u packer fans. Only complete beds are hard. Other then that love it"
"2673",4,"We are fans of the Drury chain but did not love this one. We are always disappointed when hotel windows don't open because we can't get fresh air and must have the A/C turning on and off all night, and that was the problem here. In addition, the walls were a bit thin allowing noise from next door to reach... More"
"2674",1,"Took a shower had to clean the drain my self as there was so much hair in it I would of thought I was getting the tub ready for a bath bedding had a lot of cigarette burns in it as well"
"2675",1,"This place was horrible! They are being completely remodeled so there hasn't been any general maintanance for awhile you can tell. Also, none of the staff we encountered should even be working in the hotel/service industry, no clue about their job. No pool, only a couple floors even have rentable rooms, poor selection for breakfast, all starchy items not even any fruit, and no internet in the so called business center! They could at least have put a sign on the door. We were going to do our air check-in one morning and couldn't, if we had known the night before we could have planned something else. Really awful. We had several other family members there as well. Hotels.com shouldn't even have them on their list. The photos do not portray what it is now. Bottom line-DO NOT STAY HERE!"
"2676",5,"Abraham, Maryann and Serge were excellent in their service, went above expectations.Room was clean and quiet, pool is large with soothing waterfall, breakfast and location was exceptional. Will stay at The Saint on future visits.Roger and PatI was really great having you guys, it was like having family with us. I shared your review, Serge and Marianne wanted to say hi and thank you. I hope you have already started thinking about your next trip to Key West, because we are looking forward to your next visit. Thank you for all the kind words."
"2677",5,"Bad: Crazy static electricity in the rooms during winter. Good: Awesome place, and service."
"2678",5,"Stayed two nights with two girlfriends in a room with 2 queen beds. Elkey on the front desk was very friendly on our arrival, and even sent a bottle of cava to our room to celebrate my friends' birthdays! Bellman (Argentinian, as I recall) was very helpful with directions and suggestions. Our room met our needs perfectly! Beds sooo comfy... More"
"2679",5,"Needed a place in the Summerlin area for a visit with relatives. The room was clean and spacious (we were also upgraded to a suite at the last minute). Views of the strip or mountains, or both if you get a suite. Well located for west Vegas activities. Good restaurants at the hotel and nearby. Will definitely stay there again."
"2680",1,"I took my significant other to Springhill Suites for a weekend of relaxation for his birthday and I was very disappointed. When we decided to lay down there was a blood stain on 2 different sheets. We also did not use the shower because it was a grey film covering the bottom of the bathtub. I also think there was a laundry room next to us due to all of the noise and banging early in the morning. Overall, the cleanliness of the room was a problem, but the front desk staff was very friendly!! oh and I could've done without the breakfast!!"
"2681",3,"The main features of this property are its close proximity to the beach and comparatively low price. The rooms are small and a tad cramped, and feel a little damp and musty, even with the (old) AC units running all day. But the beds and facilities were OK, the staff were all very courteous and helpful, and there was a reasonable hot breakfast on the premises. It was good for three nights, but we wouldn't want to have stayed longer."
"2682",3,"Clean, nothing fancy hotel. Only one bed in room. Right on busy highway, so some traffic noise. Great benefit of being across highway from shuttle bus to park. Good value for price compared to other hotels in area."
"2683",5,"We stayed three nights at the Springhill Suites Nov 19-22. I was greeted by very courteous staff at check in, a kind gentleman started the lobby fire for us and the facility was clean and most comfortable. The most impressive person there was DeCalvin Wilson. He served each morning at the delicious and varied deluxe continental breakfast and even came and cleared away our dishes in the expansive dining area. This young man went out of his way to care for the customers - I felt I was at the Ritz Carlton (or at least what it would be like if I could afford it). Give DeCalvin a raise and promotion. No he did not solicit such praise - I was just impressed and wrote his name down. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here."
"2684",3,"We stayed for one night. We went to the Fox theatre. It was hidden just a little bit near the Metro, so you must be aware and looking for it. The employees were very nice and the breakfast buffet was very clean. The doors in the bathroom in our room,the paint was scraped off and the floors were not the... More"
"2685",5,"Best value in Chicago ! Super clean, comfortable, cosy hotel Staff is professional and super friendly. ....and you get complementary WiFi that WORKS.....super on the floor complementary breakfast PLUS a complimentary evening drink with snacks. What more can you ask for !!! Just love it"
"2686",5,"Bad: There really needs to be a large shelf or small table in the bathroom to put stuff on. Good: loved the soaking pool."
"2687",5,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Our hotel was steps away from many city attractions and restaurants. Hotel was clean, staff friendly, and room had a view. They served omelets at breakfast and the burgers in the bar/lounge were better than any on the street and available late at night!"
"2688",5,"My son and I spent the night here and found it to be very clean and the staff to be very courteous."
"2689",4,"Nice to visit one of the old time motels (motor-hotels) which were the only type of lodgings found along the smaller highways of North America during the 50's and 60's before the interstates and bigger hotel chains came in and destroyed the tourist economies of America's small towns. A quiet location despite its proximity to the highway and quaint with... More"
"2690",3,"The bed was comfy staff were very friendly. The Hotel appears to be fairly new, so it's very clean well kept. It's right off a pretty busy street, so there was quite a bit of road noise at night. Ask for a room away from the road if you can."

"2699",5,"The overall ambience at this hotel was outstanding.

From the housekeeping staff to the desk staff the smiles and friendliness were always obvious. Daniel, Nora, David, and Shalya at the desk were so... More"
"2700",5,"Good: The bar on the rooftop"
"2701",3,"A basic, dated motel. On the positive side, it was very welcoming when I arrived and the room was clean and tidy. I can see the (newish) owner have made an effort, but really the property is in need of more upgrading than it's received."
"2702",5,"I really enjoyed the friendly staff and the room were very stylish and my wife feel in love with the bathroom we had the 2 bedroom suite and it was fantastic . We really look forward to spending a nice romantic stay in the next couple of weeks"

"2708",5,"The hotel was new and fresh and loved the fact the old, city, utilities building was repurposed and refreshed. The staff was friendly and everyone helpful.

We already booked this for our trip back in the fall."
"2715",5,"We had an extremely pleasant stay at the Virginian Suites Hotel. Like staying in an apartment it was so spacious.

"2738",4,"This was our first stay in a Drury property. After check in, we requested to switch rooms, as we were on the first floor, which was a bit noisy.

"2740",5,"The hotel was really nice even if rooms were small and the beds were so cozy it was like being in s best!! The pool was nice and clean and we had no problems getting a beach chair their. The beach was amazing !!! It was clean and had nice white sand!!!!"
"2741",3,"Bad: The hotel is very tired - could use an update. Now, I understand why such a deal. Can not figure out higher rating given to it overall. Good: Location was in the middle of the Freemont Experience."
"2742",3,"The Best Western Old Mill has been renovated and looks much nicer than previous years. The rooms were nice and clean, but were very small and crowded with furniture. The pool was just okay and there were no clean towels. The hot tub was lukewarm the entire time we were there and there was THICK ring of mold around the top of the hot tub."
"2743",5,"We were on the road, and booked this right before midnight. Really the only hotel available at that time. Quaint hotel in an adorable town, but we had a truck with 18 foot trailer - no parking! We parked 3 blocks away on the street! No problems! The hotel has a few bars and there was defiantly some parting going on, but you could not hear it from our room! Hotel had elevator, but was not working at that time and we had to climb one big set of steps! Room was clean but 'old' and charming! Think we had a 'spirit' that messed with my night lite, but was 'friendly'! Nice breakfast in the AM - coffee was amazing! Food was nicely prepared and fresh! Desk clerk at midnight was very nice and accommodating (forgot his name!) sorry! Would love to come back to 'explore' this town and would defiantly stay here again!"
"2744",5,"Stay overnight to enjoy time at the Baseball Museum and Stadium. Hotel very convenient to a lot of restaurants. Hotel staff were very informational. Hotel were very precise and peaceful in spite of multiple weddings. Would definitely like to go back. Thanks."
"2745",4,"Service is excellent for a midlevel chain motel. Good location right off Hwy 54. Usually decent rates. Room design and cleanliness are just average, but you can't have everything for a midtier price. Location and typically excellent service more than make up for any shortcomings."
"2746",5,"We were there for 3 nights and used it as a staging area for sightseeing in DC and Baltimore. It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area."
"2747",5,"We did a girls night there and it was our first time staying. The location is easy to find and great parking. Once we entered the hotel it felt like you were in someone's home. The front desk staff was so wonderful and helpful planning our night out. They leave no attention to detail unnoticed. We started our night out... More"
"2748",5,"We really needed this weekend get away to visit our daughter and to get some rest. The hotel staff was pleasant and breakfast was the best meal but they had healthy choices.

"2749",5,"The hotel offers comfortable, somewhat elegant rooms but I suppose I was more impressed with the personnel and the warmth you get interacting with them. But for my phone call bills which seemed a bit high, my stay overall was great."
"2750",4,"My wife booked this hotel for our conference. The room was nice and service was great if we requested anything they were quick to help. We didn't use the pool as it was usually raining when we would have used it. It would be nice to have a restaurant in the hotel although there are several places to eat nearby. The front lobby is kinda cool. Beds were comfortable and we had a good sleep. We wish not all lights were on one switch.Just another reason for you to return nothing better than a rooftop pool on a sunny day!Thanks for staying,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"2751",4,"The price was right and the location can't be beat. The hotel lobby and room were spotless and the staff could not have been more helpful. The gym was also very clean and the equipment was state of the art. Will definitely become a repeat customer at this hotel. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the sink leaked onto the floor creating a very minor nuisance. Highly recommended, though!"
"2752",5,"Got a great room on top floor great service great deal! Close to Tampa Airport and beautiful property/gardens - wish we had more time to explore! Loved the Starbucks in the room spacious foyer/bathroom and comfy beds too"

"2754",5,"Staying at this hotel just made sense for us. My husband had to travel to CA and I had to stay in GA but about 45 mins away from the airport and we were very tired.

"2757",5,"Our guests had a fabulous weekend. Rooms were beautiful. Staff were amazing and so accommodating. Comfortable lobby with pool table and games was a great meeting space. We had a light breakfast for our guests the morning after the wedding in the lobby and it worked out great. Would highly recommend Aloft Downtown as the hotel for your wedding guests!Hi Jeanne, Thanks for the FIVE BUBBLES!! It was a thrill to serve the entire wedding party. It was the first time we used W XYZ for a wedding brunch and we're delighted you enjoyed the space. Sorry about the rain, it would have been really cool for your family and friends to enjoy the Backyard. Hope the bride and groom enjoy the honeymoon! We'd love to have all of you back for the anniversaries! Evan"
"2758",5,"We stayed at the hotel while visiting the USF campus. The double queen executive suite was very spacious and clean.

"2762",5,"I had stopped by here with my family just to stop by. We did not stay, but rather wanted to see this new property. It is near the Napa River. There is also a Century theater and an In-Shape in the same parking lot. The grounds were immaculate. Once I walked in, all I could say was WOW!. It was beautiful, modern and I felt comfortable as I walked in. We purchased some waters from the gift shop as we were driving around through Napa, Calistoga, and St. Helena. Kalah (I believe that was her name- she had curly brown hair), was so warm upon us walking into the lobby. I asked if I could take a look around just to see what the common areas looked like, she said absolutely! It was beautiful. I am looking forward to my future stay(s) here. I will say as I passed a young lady, Danielle. It was like she did not want to be there or she was having an off day. She did not acknowledge me as a guest as she passed by or even at the desk. Overall still 5 Stars. Kalah (hopefully that was her name) was AWESOME! See you Soon!Dear LeMoura G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Your comments especially the Wow are bells to my ears. We truly do have a unique Hampton capturing the Napa Valley throughout the building. It was very satisfying to hear your awesome comments about Kalah. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar."

"2764",4,"Good location. Close to highway. Close to shopping and lots of nice restaurants on 58. Easy drive to zoo, Nauticus, USS Wisconsin, Botanical Gardens, Aquarium. Save money and purchase savings pass that gets you into 4 major attractions. About 60 mins to Williamsburg. Hotel is clean, free breakfast with good selections and changes every couple of days."
"2765",5,"Up to date hotel, consider carrying Starbucks coffee in the rooms, access to the business center was a plus and you had working printers too great amenity. I would stay here again"
"2766",5,"Bad: The pull out couch was extremely uncomfortable. Good: Room was great. Staff was friendly and welcoming."
"2767",5,"Comfortable and clean room and bathroom. Delicious breakfast. Perfect location for our activities along the river with its newly constructed river walk. Renovation of this building in art-deco style is superb -- enjoying the architectural design is part of the experience. Highly recommend this Hampton Inn."

EVERYONE we encountered was incredibly nice and accommodating Everything was clean, our room, the pool area, and bar. The beds were fine, bedding looked fairly new...I only had one issue and that was the continental breakfast. It was awful, but then again aren't they all"
"2772",1,"First I want to say we had amazing customer service! They let us check in our bags early, the maid service was great (we tip them, you should too!) the shuttle was on time to the airport and the driver helped us with our bags (tip him too!)However, the heated indoor pool was not on. This is my main reason for choosing Drury, since I have children who love to swim. We were disappointed. The food, another reason we choose Drury, was not edible. There was popcorn made once a day, around 10 am, and there it sat all day. I will stay at Drury again, but not this one!"
"2773",3,"I have to say I am never happy when I get out of my car and walk into my room.

Donna, at the front desk, said she'd be right up. After waiting 10 minutes, I called back down to see when she anticipated coming... More"
"2780",2,"I have stayed at this location several times and this place has gone downhill. They spent a lot to upgrade it-now they need to invest in good staff and bring back the happy hour! I was put in a handicap accessible room-so if you need those types of rooms they are well equipped!"

"2789",5,"Bad: One person a touch too familiar / jokey at reception when checking in and out, but not really a problem. She certainly wasn't rude. Some might think it adds character. Good: Central location, nice rooms, comfortable bed. We could shop happily in the Westfield Mall right next door and In Market Street / Union Square."

Great room - compl. upgraded was provided to us so we had 2 queen beds and 2 bathrooms so the room was very spaces and was always kept clean. Complimentary water bottles are refill stations on every floor as well as coffee on level 2. Staff is amazing and have great advice on restaurants and places to visit. Only issue with my room was that it looked out towards trump tower - not exactly what you want to wake up to each day.Hello Helen D,Thank you for choosing Chicago River Hotel during your recent travels. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your complimentary upgrade and enjoyed the extra space. We are very lucky to be right in the middle of the city and within walking distance to all major attractions.

"2798",4,"Bad: The hotel has no real public areas, and there's a facilities fee which I didn't realize. The reception staff weren't that helpful. The room wasn't quiet enough for a really good night's sleep due to loud aircon and some other random noise that persisted even with aircon off. Good: The bed was comfortable with a really good sized bathroom. WiFi was good."

"2802",5,"It rocked. Went for a two day concert, so many fellow showmates stayed at the hotel. The pool area was transformed into a pre-game party with food and tunes. The hotel and staff were outstanding. The only drawback was that it would have been nice if the hotel shuttle operated on the weekend."
"2803",4,"This BB was charming and clean, with great furnishings and ambience. We loved staying there. Couldn't get a better location.

"2809",3,"We had a good stay at the Lincoln Plaza Hotel. The hotel decor is a bit outdated, so it was kind of like stepping back into the 1980's. But everything else was just fine about our stay. The check-in process was quick and easy. The staff was friendly. Our room was clean and comfortable. There is a refrigerator in the room for keeping items chilled. There was a coffee maker, as well, with both tea and coffee. The bathroom was small, but everything worked just fine. We needed extra towels and a visit to the front desk to ask for them had the towels delivered to our room in about five minutes. The hotel is located in the middle of Monterey Park, which is a majority Asian populated city. If you have an issue with being served by Asian staff, surrounded by Asian guests, and having people in your hotel speak a different language with each other when they are not speaking with you, then you might have issues staying at this hotel. But if you would like a clean, comfortable, budget-friendly place to stay when in the Los Angeles Area, the Lincoln Plaza Hotel should work nicely for you."
"2810",4,"Arrived at the Hotel from Dulles airport at 15:50 the young man on the reception who introduced himself as B was at once friendly and welcoming and made a good first impression. The hotel although a bit dated is clean and easy to get around, the room I was in was spacious and with the benefit of it's own kitchen a blessing after a long day sight seeing. A shuttle bus runs frequently to and from the hotel to Rosslyn Metro station and the driver helpful and friendly, although if the weather is nice a walk down the hill is to Rosslyn and the Metro is no more than 10 minutes. All in all a good hotel and location with easy access to Washington DC."

"2814",4,"We have stayed at this hotel many times. I think it's great for families. My son loves the small arcade, bowling alley, movie theatre, pool and Friday's restaurant. I love the fact that the rooms are large, very clean and come with a small fridge. It is also great for families to have the shower and toilet area seperate. In addition to Friday's restaurant there are other restaurants including a 24 hour cafe and an ice cream shop that stays open late as well, very convenient. There are also shopping centers near the hotel that include just about every store and restaurant you can think of, Target, PF Changs, Mimi's etc. My parents had an odd numbered room and it overlooked the pool and golf course. My even numbered room overlooked a roof, not so nice. This is really the only negative I can think of. Also, pool area has no lifeguard or supervision of any kind, so some adults got a little unruly, drinking beer in the pool, speaking loudly etc. But, overall this is a nice place to stay off the strip, especially for those traveling to Las Vegas with children."
"2815",4,"The stay in the hotel was very pleasant, everything was clean and quiet even with renovations in the lobby. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpfull. The rooms are very big and bed super comfortable."
"2816",4,"I have 4 teens. So there were 6 of us in a room. That get cramped! This two bedroom suite had 2 (!) bathrooms and a kitchen. NO one slept on the floor. It was awesome! Tons of room to spread out, we weren't tripping over each other."

"2824",5,"We arrived at the hotel a few days after a devastating thunderstorm had knocked out power to a large portion of DC, MD, VA. The hotel had opened up to refugees that had no power so they did not have a room with 2 double beds as we had ordered. They gave us a room with a king bed and a rollaway bed. It was cramped for 4 of us. But the hotel staff was indeed marvelous and went out of their way to make our stay at DC a very good experience. Excellent location with metro and a great shopping mall on site. Lots of fabulous restaurants within a short walk. My kids loved the hotel and their indoor pool. We will stay there again the next time we visit DC."

The room was clean and comfortable although a couple of the towels in the bathroom were dirty, there were enough for all of us to use this stay.

The property is well staffed, well dressed, professional and courteous. And waaaay out of place. The Millennium is a four star, but the star scale appears to have increased to ten or twelve. I took... More"
"2832",5,"The hotel is strategically located near the Coliseum. It is surrounded by lots of food, shopping, post office, banking, etc. It is also very easy to get to Langley AFB, 64, etc. There seemed to be a lot of late night activity on the main drive, but very little of that spilled back to this hotel. It is a great alternative to trying to secure a short term lease, but it is like living on your own. The weekly housekeeping is good, but it is only weekly."
"2833",2,"Hotel was under construction and smelled bad and was very messy. On top of that the staff was bad. We were in a rush and needed a cab to get to an event. We told the man at the desk to call a cab when we checked in. When we came down later he hadn't gotten a cab for us, so we asked him to call the cab again. After sitting in the lobby for 15 minutes waiting, we asked when our cab was coming and he said he didnt know we still wanted a cab and would call. Eventually 25 minutes later a cab dropped someone off at the hotel and we were able to take that cab."

"2837",3,"Neat landscaping, clean older room. Management appears to care about this place. My son is a student at Toccoa Falls college. This is the best hotel we have found in the area. Ours was a pleasant stay."
"2838",4,"This is a long-term stay hotel, so our room came with a kitchenette and small living room with a sofa and coffee table. We only stayed there for three nights, so didn't make use of the extra space, but it was nice to have room to move around. The reception desk was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great, but skip the omelet bar. The line was too long, and it took forever. There were plenty of other options available (cereal, fruit, pastries, potatoes, eggs, oatmeal...). The complimentary shuttle was great for sightseeing. We took it to Pike Place and downtown saved on taxis and uber. Housekeeping could be more attentive, but since our stay was brief and we're not slobs, it was fine. Can't beat the location - literally across the street from the Space Needle and Chihuly.mistybunny,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge"
"2839",3,"Check in took several minutes because the hotel clerk was having trouble with the guest before us. Clerk was not especially welcoming. Room is clean and updated, but sparse. This room was adequate but we would not have stayed there except it is within walking distance to Disneyland."
"2840",2,"Not up to HHonors standards. Beautiful property, nice rooms and bath room nice clean carpets and bedding / bed comfort. But, NO HOT WATER for 25 minutes - each morning. Yes, we were told to wait 20+ minutes for the hot water to get up to the room level. And, the internet didn't connect, so we (my traveling partner - in another room) had to use the 'staff' WiFi with their password.Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we do apologize for not meeting expectations during your recent stay. I will review all aspects of design and address accordingly to ensure our guests enjoy their time as our guests. The boiler at our hotel did experience a mechanical issue that we addressed as quickly as possible but this did however cause our guests to experience no hot water for a period of time. Please know that this was not due to anything other than bad luck and timing. Our boiler is very new and plenty big enough for our hotel, this was an isolated issue that has been corrected moving forward. We are however happy to hear that you felt safe and secure while staying with us and do hope to have you back as our guests the next time you travel to New Orleans. Sincerely,"

"2852",3,"Overall I enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The staff were very courteous and helpful at all times. I had to ask to be moved after my first night - my original room smelled very musty - I thought it was cigarette smoke even though it was a non-smoking hotel. They promptly moved me the following day to a much nicer room on the 10th floor. I must say though, I thought it was a bit inappropriate that, on the morning when I was moved, one male member of staff (at least I thought) was very condescending to another staff member in front of me - insisting several times that she call housekeeping to clean my previous room straight away (he could've waited until I wasn't standing there) as she had her hands full trying to move me to a different room. Aside from that though - all of the other members of staff were first class. The furniture was a bit dated as well, however for a budget(ish) hotel, it was more than adequate. Good water pressure too in the shower."
"2853",3,"Earlier review was for wrong hotel in a diff state but now the hotel stay isnt the best but my issue was getting a busy signal every time i tried to reach my fiance on the room phone so annoying but the hotel can use some new clean mattresses. Anyways the phone issue was my biggest problem."

The hotel is not outside the gates of anything as the description stated also. Good: Breakfast was excellent"

"2872",5,"Our room was spacious enough for 4. Even with our very late arrival, the front desk person was friendly and gave us a good room. The breakfast was the best so far on the trip, with cold and hot options, like scrambled eggs and sausage. A nice find along the way."

I asked her to call the front desk to tell them but she didn't want to. We also had to stop by the office to get a bath mat. I know I didn't pay a lot, but I would rather pay for peace of mind than to experience yuck."

We were able to walk to the Casino, Bourbon Street, Canal Street, etc- it is really a great little hotel in a perfect location. Oh yeah, the roof- we thoroughly enjoyed. Nice mingle spot! Good drinks and food! Don't slip- I heard about and purchased thru Hotwire as not known until I paid for it- great choice-but will book direct next time.

"2883",3,"Barely a 4-star. Bathroom looked like something out of a Holiday Inn. The actual room itself had a very conveniently mounted TV so high marks for that, but beyond that there was nothing indicative of the price point. The sheets, pillows, and bed were mediocre at best. Also the room had the same, if not cheaper, in-room AC unit as a Townplace Inn I stayed at as well. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, but that doesn't justify the price. Also, they provided 0 benefits as a Expedia VIP member. Definitely would not stay here again. I'd either price down and stay somewhere else, or go a little bit higher to a 5-star."

However they did take care of the barking dog next door immediately and it stopped for the rest of the night. That only happened once in all my stays.It still looks brand new on the inside. Highly recommend this hotel."

"2895",5,"We checked in late on Friday night. The desk clerk was very friendly and quick to help us get checked in. The only issue wass when we went to get in the room. You could only turn the handle upward to open the door. We met Alicia, manager at the front desk. the next morning. She was very informative of the surrounding area and helped us get around to places that we wanted to go to. The bathroom and whole room was very clean and pleasant. The whole staff were friendly professional. This will be my hotel of choice when I come to the Phoenix area. Thanks to Alicia and all the staff for helping in making it a great weekend stay."
"2896",2,"Power went out due to a snow storm however, partial power was available. Light bulb was burned out in the bathroom though (unrelated to power outage. Hotel is very difficult to find, but the staff were courteous when I called for directions. TV cable is on satellite and most channels were not available due to the storm. Surprising that they're not on standard ground cable. Internet was lost as well due to power issues. Hotel was clean and nice, but dated. Exercise room is small and dated. Bar service was very slow and inefficient. Hotel did a good job clearing the parking lot and sidewalk of snow by morning. However, it would have been nice to have some help to open the sliding doors while carrying all my stuff to exit the hotel, which were difficult to open."

"2899",5,"The living room area was cramped and the cable wasn't that great but other than that, for the price the stay was good."
"2900",3,"These rooms are great if you're in town for a limited purpose, ie (business trip, seeing friends or family, etc). However, I don't recommend if you're looking for something fancy or romantic. It's a very old building and a little run-down. I wasn't wild about the location either. It's tucked away and kind of hard to get to if you're not familiar with the area. If you can get a deal through one of those sites out there, do it but it's definitely not worth what they tell you over the phone."
"2901",3,"good price, nice breakfast, staff very polite. room had sock under desk. bathroom could be cleaned better. stuff was left in fridge."
"2902",5,"At check in, the staff was most friendly and helpful. There only one night, my suite was clean and comfortable. Beds were very good (wimpy pillows though). Only negative was the noise of another's air conditioning unit running for hours. That type of noise should not be heard at all! Overall, I would recommend Springhill Suites!!"
"2903",5,"The hotel did not have to room I reserved. So I was bribed with free breakfast and free parking. Although it was a nice jester it still doesn't make up for me being placed in a room that did not accommodate my party. I booked 30 days in advance yet these people saw it fit to check other people into those rooms knowing that they had other guests arriving that booked the same room. A guest behind me was told the same thing. The staff was incredibly nice and graceful buy, I guess you have to when greedy corporations overbook hotels and leave them to deal with the customers."
"2904",5,"We love this hotel. The service is excellent, staff is welcoming and friendly, rooms spacious and nicely decorated. The restaurant is wonderful- we've enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner numerous times and have always been pleased. The location is perfect for exploring the city or neighboring islands."
"2905",2,"First of all, the staff was very nice. However, I was very disappointed in this hotel.

The front desk kindly offered... More"

Not fancy but comfortable and clean.There's no breakfast included, which is not a good point, but there are several restaurants nearby (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and others). The hotel is also close to several train stations.Wifi works well in the bedroom. The fees are not so cheap, but for that location all hotels use to be expensive, so I'd say this one offers a good cost-benefit ratio.In general it was a good experience and I'd stay there again in the future.Dear Camila LThank you very much for the review of your recent stay with us at The Central Loop HotelI am delighted that we were able to offer you good value for money and you were able to enjoy all the amenities that we offer and appreciated our great location from which to get out and see the city.I was especially delighted to read about the service we offered you - we know that these small things make all the difference.

I was in town for the night and booked a room last minute. I had 4 adults in one room and when I booked the only available option was 1 queen and 1 sofa bed in a room. I asked if they have any rooms available with 2 beds and they were able to accommodate me last minute which was great. Also at checkin they provided 2 cold bottles of water which was a nice touch. The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door. The pool was simple and on the smaller side. Parking like every other hotel is expensive and you will find better options searching on your phone to park yourself. The complimentary breakfast was solid, they offer waffles,yogurt, juice, prepackaged omlets and breakfast sandwiches that were very good.

"2930",1,"I don't recommend anyone to stay there! Because this is the most awful hotel in Wisconsin Dells! Poor service! Disgusting rooms not clean! Noizy! hole on the walls! Don't visit this hotel! NEver ever ever"
"2931",5,"Bad: I had to be switched because these people next door were partying all hours of the night. At 3am they decided to start arguing in the hall. I called security once for them to turn up their music right after they left. Then security came up again while they were in the hall screaming. I will say this the hotel made it right. They gave me that night free and switched me rooms. Good: The rooms were beautiful. Comfy beds good breakfast."
"2932",2,"Even though its non smoking rooms, first room had an odor. They changed rooms..odor was not as bad. Bed was not comfortable."
"2933",5,"This is truly heaven on earth. Very modern, nice and clean hotel in the middle of everything in Key West. Friendly staff, free parking 2 blocks away... only 5 min walk away.We will defiantly be back.Hi Mr. Kortbaek, it was truly a pleasure having you spend gracious time with us during your trip to Key West. We greatly appreciate all the kind words you have for our property and staff. Please keep us in mind should you be traveling to Key West in the near or not so near future. Once again Thank You."
"2934",4,"Great location for us with family. There is a really nice exercise room, laundry, pool and business office. Coffee and tea are in the room with a fridge. The staff are friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable with a prepared breakfast which I prefer rather than the carb load at some Best Westerns."
"2935",5,"We were here for a three-day dance convention. We travel a lot, and this hotel was very excellent. The room was very clean and comfortable. The only complaint I have is the service in the restaurant was lacking. When I went for dinner, I had to pour my own glass of water and waited almost 20 minutes for a server to finally come to my table. Otherwise, the hotel was great."
"2936",1,"it was ok I guess looks were deceiving"
"2937",5,"Bad: None. Good: My overall experience was great!"
"2938",5,"Good: Great value. Great location."
"2939",5,"This hotel was in a terrific location.  Walking distance from all sights.  The hotel staff was very accommodating. We arrived very early in the morning and they had a room for us.  Our flight out was late in the day, so they held our luggage and also called for our cab service to the airport, which arrived right on schedule."
"2940",5,"MIcrotel's business model is that the rooms are small,but they are clean, well appointed and there some nice courtesies in Otis Spunkmeyer Cookies and 24 hour coffee/tea.The staff was polite and responsive. I received a callback about lost Crocs within 48 hours."
"2941",1,"We checked in at 6 pm, 3 hours after check in time of 3pm. Our room wasn't ready and housekeeping staff could be seen standing outside smoking. Granted I was given a 15 discount however, I would have happily paid another 50 per night to not be in that neighborhood. Employees smoking at the door to the lobby, the smell of weed in the hallway, a fight in the parking lot, literally people walking in off the street for the continental breakfast and asking us to use our cell phones, our room was 54 degrees upon entering.... I could go on and on, but won't. Needless to say I would never stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone. Our friends chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. And they would hang out in our room because theirs reeked. Regardless of how much Lysol of ours they used, it smelled. On a scale of 1-10 it was a 1."
"2942",3,"Hidden away from heavy traffic"
"2943",5,"Good: The free continental breakfast is beyond our expectation and saved us lots of hassle in the morning. Our whole family loved it."
"2944",3,"Front desk was not helpful. Never told me breakfast was free in resturant. I found this out the second night I was there when a different person was at the desk. Dead bolt did not work but someone did fix it."
"2945",3,"The hotel is a bit shabby and needs updating. Outdoor pool was decent, but the pool furniture was falling apart, and there was very little of it. On the sides of the pool, was a ton of trash, garbage, debris, and an old mattress propped up behind the dumpster. They really should see these things and clean it up. The room was like a small suite, with a new flat screen. The couch however was filthy. The couches in the rooms that I saw when doors were open, all need cleaned big time. Bed was OK, comfortable enough. I asked for an unstained comforter when I got there extra pillows, and my requests were pleasantly handled right away. I must say, the staff were all very nice. Maids forgot to replenish the coffee in the room, and I had to go for it 3 times. But they were always nice and brought anything we needed. It would never be my first choice in Beaufort, but not my last, either. They just need to pay attention to DEEPER cleaning and updating. Well-intentioned OK for a night or two."
"2946",5,"Breakfast wasn't te best but beside that everything else was perfect. They supplied us with an extra crib and crib sheet. Help with any question we had and the staff was extremely generous."
"2947",5,"This hotel is new and extremely clean (trust me...I checked every corner -) ) and the nice girl at the counter (I think her name was Tari or something similar) was very helpful and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend this hotel. It is right behind a big shopping center and just 30 minutes from Galveston"
"2948",5,"I'd never been to Portland for any extended time before and my boyfriend insisted the Regency Hotel was in the best location and I'd love it. We took an overnight trip for my birthday and even though I was trying to sway him to another more trendy hotel, this one was everything he promised and I'm glad we didn't go... More"
"2949",5,"Ha! I've always wanted to use that song title for a review. ARIA has given me the opportunity to do so. Now, there were only two issues with my ARIA stay. Check in and the numbering system in the hallways. The hotel receptionist had a hard time divvying up our check in, understanding that several nights were to be paid... More"
"2950",5,"WiFi was not any good. Everything else, was enough for the price."
"2951",3,"The hotel would not. The hair dryer was broken. The cable was out in the area. However, when we caller for service they came to repair the toilet and the hairdryer right away."
"2952",5,"Good: It was located just off the strip and easy access to everything can't go wrong!!!"
"2953",2,"Stayed here on business and left something behind in my room. Called the day after I left and the person in Housekeeping confirmed that they had found the item. She said the manager would contact me about returning it to me. Didn't hear from the manager so I called 3 more times over the next 2 weeks - spoke with... More"
"2954",5,"Sold our house and couldn't move into new house for several weeks. Spent a week at this hotel. The staff was VERY accommodating. Marilynn, who serves the free breakfast, was very nice and welcoming. Housekeeping did a great job as well."
"2955",5,"We chose the Grand Hyatt Kauai for the first here nights of our honeymoon in Hawaii. It was amazing - the staff were super helpful, the grounds are amazing and the food was great. In particular, the sushi at Stevensons Library is probably the best we've had (the tempura roll epic). Dinner at Tidepools was pretty good, a bit... More"
"2956",4,"Great rooms for the price and great breakfast compared to the usual continental. Shuttle service to the Metro line very useful. Great way to travel to the downtown area and even to the airport."
"2957",5,"Love this place"
"2958",1,"The maid never came to our room. I reported this to the front desk no clean towels, the bed was not made, trash not emptied, etc. Active smokers were outside on the balconies, which is the only way to get to the rooms, day and night. Spend a few extra dollars and find another place down the road."
"2959",5,"We always enjoy our stays at Hampton Inns and have never spent the night in a bad one. This HI was up to the usual high standard and is a place we feel good to stay. The complimentary breakfast is more than adequate for our needs although a non cheese hot choice would be most welcome. The staff were helpful... More"
"2960",5,"Captain's Manor Inn is my favorite place on Cape Cod. As always, the innkeepers, Trish Kevin made sure I was well taken care of.

Keep in mind Kingsland water has a significant sulfur taste, so tap water is almost undrinkable. Later when I requested the water, I was told I had been promised something in error and would... More"
"2962",5,"The staff and the level of service at this Hampton Inn were amazing. They are very polite and helpful. Whenever I'm in the Alexandria, VA area, I always choose this Hampton Inn because of the service they provide and the environment while in their facility. The rooms are clean and comfortable while you are away from home."
"2963",5,"What I Expected"
"2964",5,"Good: The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and well maintained"
"2965",2,"The shower had issues maintaining one temperature which was very disheartening. The first room I checked in to reeked of cigarettes, but they gladly moved me once I complained. Overall a little underwhelmed with the hotel this time around..."
"2966",1,"I called to cancel my reservation because I booked in the wrong place. The guy did not understand what I was saying then responded with we charge already before he rudely hung up on me. I needed to book in Thomson Ga and not Thomaston.Sir Sorry You late call and we busy all most full and I hold room. Thanks Sam"
"2967",5,"We have stayed at this motel many times while visiting family in Tennessee. I never even consider another motel. We have always been treated very well here. Everyone is considerate and friendly. The prices are just right and the location is convenient for us. I recommend it highly."
"2968",3,"For the price, its perfect but it doesn't feel the cleanest only because its a little old and outdated. great for family. pull out sofa and upstairs loft bed was perfect for my children. I feel it was very average. Carpet definitely needs updating and sofa/bed/ furniture also needs to be updated but it is perfect place if you need... More"
"2969",5,"Good: Room was lovely with great linen towels etc! Great coffee n basics ! Fabulous location close to everything!"
"2970",4,"Came here with friends to attend the Hilly Hundred bike ride. The front desk staff went out of their way to help us, from locking our 2 Tandem bikes in the office Fri night to digging up 8 safety pins for our name bibs. Everyone was very pleased with our rooms - they actually smelled nice without being perfumy -... More"
"2971",5,"The stay was a good little get away for me and my wife, and to take care of some business."
"2972",5,"Traveled with my family for the 5A state championship in Hillsboro, but found almost all of the hotels in the area were full. Found this little gem in Forest Grove, and enjoyed it far more than we expected to. The place was impeccably clean, and the staff was excellent. My kids loved the pool, and the hot tub was great... More"
"2973",4,"We jammed four people (two adults and two older teenagers) into a room with a King and a sofa bed and rollaway. It worked pretty well, and we would definitely do it again. The front desk staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful!"
"2974",3,"This hotel is exceptionally priced for what it offers (e.g. complimentary breakfast, well equiped fitness center, wireless internet), but the price is due to its terrible location and accessibility. Very friendly staff too, but getting there safely is the challenge."
"2975",4,"We stayed in this hotel with 2 rooms and 3 bathrooms.One balcony in the first floor. No hastle with meeting or offerings of timesharing. It has one medium pool and a jacuzzi. You can also be playing some tennis. You can also BBQ if you like grilling. The only problem was internet. Too slow and at night very difficult to... More"
"2976",4,"What's really unpleasing is that the hotel has no windows that can be opened and the air conditioning system has old filters, as much as I can say. There's a 'smell' of old air throughout the hotel and in the room (I was), which could only be explained with less than efficient functioning of the a/c system."
"2977",3,"Stayed at the Aria for 3 nights March 5-8 The comps aren't what they used to be. We booked our comp suite after analyzing our offers. We turned down 400 more dollars to experience the Corner suite at the Aria... surprise!!! When we arrived they down graded our suite.. so read the fine print!!! It does say that in there... More"
"2978",4,"For the price you can't beat the value. They are 6 minutes away from casinos. The rooms are decent. The hotel staff were very friendly. Freshly painted and updated. Not bad at all for price. It really is a perfect place for those on a budget who want to go to Boardwalk or casinos."
"2979",4,"Bad: Parking fees."
"2980",5,"The Residence Inn in Naples was a great place to stay in Naples. They upgraded us to a two bedroom suite after the first night which was very nice (I'm a Platinum member). Thanks Lauren! Close to downtown, beaches and plenty of restaurants. The pool area is very nice and all of the staff was great. Highly recommended for families."
"2981",5,"Brand new hotel and GREAT STAFF! We got the GIANT 2 queen suite...the room was ENORMOUS! Quiet and a wonderful breakfast included! Great location and greeted with wonderful courtesy. Any question or concern was immediately taken care of!"
"2982",5,"My Husband and I stayed here last week after returning from a week long cruise out of Charleston. I usually stay at Marriott's or Hilton properties but thought we would try Holiday Inn Express. We were pleasantly surprised! This is a very nice property that has obviously just been renovated. The lobby was beautifully done, as were the rooms and breakfast areas. The staff all seemed eager to help and please. The General Manager seems like she is doing a great job and is hands on as I saw her at the Front Desk on a few occasions talking to staff and interacting with guests. I really appreciated the fact that they had laundry facilitites there to use also, considering we had a lot of dirty laundry from the cruise.The free breakfast was also a bonus as it wasn't your usual boring continental breakfast offerings. They had different items on each of the mornings we were there. Some were: Omelettes, sausage, biscuits, bacon and warm cinnamon buns! The coffee was great (and I am fussy with my coffee!) and they even had a pancake machine.While the location wasn't right downtown we did get a reasonable rate and there was a FREE trolley service right at the side of the hotel. We didn't use the car, instead just jumped on the trolley and were in downtown Charleston in no time!"
"2983",4,"Spent 4 nights here as a base for rock climbing in nearby Maple Canyon. Proved to be a good choice as the Canyon was only 30 minutes drive away. We found the hotel ideal for our purposes - rooms, clean and well equipped with very comfortable Queen beds. Staff exceptionally friendly and helpful. Breakfast pretty basic but ok. We were... More"
"2984",4,"Bad: Vacant block and vagrancy around hotel. Good: Proximity to the strip, yet quiet and friendly"
"2985",4,"I have stayed at this property twice and both times was not disappointed. The rooms are always clean and as they should be. The staff at this property make a huge difference in their friendly manner. Staff was very helpful in locating any items I may need. Food is good at the Bistro, but it is only open for breakfast... More"
"2986",1,"The room was big and bed comfortable. Everything else was bad. Dirty, no hot water. Poor TV reception. Spotty wifi. Moldy hallway. Dangerous neighborhood. Bkfst only for tour groups. Faucets poor condition. Couch stained and baggy. Rug stained. Hole in door screen. Road under construction. Etc. etc."
"2987",5,"They are very accommodating and friendly!!-The only downside is there is no free parking at the hotel but besides that...it was great"
"2988",4,"The hotel itself is lovely and the staff were very kind and helpful. Just a couple of downsides the shower gel was low throughout our stay and you could get hardly any out i was a bit surprised this wasn't checked during housekeeping. The shower itself also wasn't very powerful. We had a clock in the room but it wasn't showing the right time and appeared to be out of battery didnt think this looled very good. The air conditioning was quite noisy but you could get a good temperature. We enjoyed our stay though as i said just a few minor things."
"2989",1,"Arriving at this hotel we had an open mind, this surely changed within the next hour of our stay. We checked in at roughly 10 PM, this process took a drooling 15 minutes at least. The two staff members had a hard time finding my reservation that was booked 3 days before through Hotels.com. We finally received our key, drove... More"
"2990",5,"Bad: Listed Parking but thought is was included... you should point that out. Good: Clean, modern, staff was outstanding"
"2991",3,"The reviews made this hotel seem better than it was. It was fine. And we could have been in a better location for the same rate with more local amenities nearby."
"2992",5,"My husband and I planned a last minute trip and chose this motel based on reviews. It was a favorite! The room, including bathroom was very clean. Bed was comfortable with crisp sheets that were so appreciated after a long day of activities. Pool along with hot tub and sauna was clean, and all worked perfectly. It was conveniently located....

"2993",5,"this has been our 4 or 5 th time we have stayed here for about 4 weeks and as always if not better our stay was excellent.Still miss our morning hugs from the staff at breakfast,hope to see you all next year. H"
"2994",3,"Room was decent for a night's stay. I've stayed in a cleaner room a few weeks earlier. Perhaps the last room was slightly more updated as well. Staff is always so nice and helpful."
"2995",5,"The rooms are luxurious, the staff are very accommodating, and the casino is not overly crowded. Best of all, the beds are insanely comfy!! The best stay we've had in all the times we've been to Vegas. We will always stay here from now on."
"2996",3,"Toliet overflowed. Rug remained wet. Carpet wet and smelled moldy in my daughters room. Water in drinking fountain cloudy. Breakfast buffet excellent. Staff friendly and helpful except when the toilet water was running everywhere. Free shuttle to the airport and metro very convenient."
"2997",4,"When we checked in, we had no toiletries due to the strict airline restrictions from Canada, so the clerk at the front desk took care of everything for us with complimentary necessities. We were also given a complimentary appetizer for their restaurant, and were informed that daily happy hours was between 5:30 - 7:30 pm. Our room was really nice, clean and comfortable with updated furnishings. A little more attention to detail could have been made with the cleaning reagarding some marks and soiling on the walls, but nothing to complain about. After having spent over 30 hours travelling, we were very pleased to find that happy hour consisted of our choice of a long list of spirits, beer, and wine (unlimited), as well as tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole - all complimentary. A full breakfast buffet is included, which is as good as anywhere we've ever been. Sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, milk, juice, tea, coffee, bagels, toast, english muffins, sweet buns, fruit, yogurt, and made to order omlette. Lunch and supper in the restaurant was also really good. Some of the best wings I've ever had."
"2998",5,"Just stayed here for the Who concert and also for the Paul McCartney concert in April 2016. Both at the Key Arena: easy walking distance. Nice thing is that Francisco at the front desk remembered me when I checked in this time! Or better yet, he'd gotten my request for connecting rooms and already blocked them for me! That's pretty good service, I reckon."
"2999",5,"We always try and stay at Hampton Inn . This is our first stay at this one and it is the best yet. Clean. No smoking. We had 4 rooms and every one was really nice with great beds and linens. Staff was awesome. ..every single person . Will absolutely stay here again."
"3000",3,"A nice place to stay. I would recommend changing the breakfast menu (it was dried out, pretty tasteless, except for the waffles). One of the 2 elevators was broken, so you had to walk all the way to the other end of the hotel, go to your floor, then walk all tbe way back to your room. The staff, however, are top notch. Going to DC they have a shuttle to the metro. Good value for the price."
"3001",5,"While in St. Louis for a medical visit, selected this Hampton Inn due to close proximity to Barnes Medical. Was upgraded to a suite at check-in. The room had a king bed, sofa, work area, refrigerator, and microwave. The room was comfortable, clean, quiet, and the hotel staff were very professional and pleasant. Breakfast was good and the eating area... More"
"3002",5,"We got some needed clothes shopping done and then had dinner and drinks at El Gaucho. What a wonderful hotel and connected restaurant experience. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys first class service and wonderful food."
"3003",2,"I checked in to the hotel greeted with a smile, which was good. Mind you the concierge was a little chatty. But that may just be me since I was exhausted coming in. When I went in to the room, it was stuffy even with the AC on. Which was really, really loud. I could not sleep. And if I turn down the AC, it was too hot. Opening the window, there was too much noise from the traffic outside. It was close to the highway and it was impossible to drive out of the lot without having to make a U-turn somewhere first. The bathroom was moldy. The breakfast was bad. The coffee was horrible. All in all, I had to check out after 1 night of my 5 night stay and checked in at a different hotel altogether. I was not happy."
"3004",5,"Very clean, comfortable room. Staff was helpful and attentive. Decent fitness area. The hotel is situated central to some decent restaurants and you can dine on site too. I will stay there again next time I visit."
"3005",5,"I cannot say enough about this outstanding hotel. Everything was top notch! The valets and front desk went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable, easy and memorable! La Jolla is so beautiful and upon our return we will only stay at this amazing property!"
"3006",5,"I loved this little motel. At first we picked it just for the location and price. Turned out to have very friendly service, and clean rooms. It's not a 5 star, but if you are a thrifty traveller you will like it. The pier and Venice Beach were just a 10 minute walk away. Main St. has lots of cute... More"

"3008",5,"Traveling with our High School Varsity Girls Basketball team to a Holiday Tournament this past weekend in Boise I spent two nights at the Oxford Suites and enjoyed it thoroughly. The usual 7 hour drive from Coeur d'Alene took 11 which meant we went straight to our game and checked in late. Hotel staff adjusted beautifully and had everything ready... More"
"3009",4,"VERY clean, comfortable place to stay located near downtown Napa. The grounds are nothing special, but there is a (very) small pool and jacuzzi, as well as a small fitness center. Clean, comfortable and conveniently located. If you plan to mostly be out and about in Napa, stay here. If you plan to spend your time lounging around the pool and grounds, pick someplace else. But you'll probably have to pay more.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay."
"3010",5,"Great location, friendly staff. Nice room. Breakfast OK. Wish the eggs were real instead of powdered. Suite was good for working. Shopping close by. Easy access to major highways. Highly recommend staying at this hotel."
"3011",5,"I have been staying at the Four Points Sheraton in Plainview dozens of times in the past 5 years. The hotel staff is very friendly.

"3013",5,"I booked this hotel for our layover stay in Atlanta due to the proximity to the aquarium. Great hotel, extremely friendly and helpful staff, and the restaurant attached had amazing food! I highly recommend!"
"3014",5,"Awesome place, got it at a great deal. Room was spacious and clean, Customer service people were very nice and respectable. Would definitely want to stay again when in that area."
"3015",4,"Staff was friendly and place was clean and very nice. Only issues that we had was the windows were a bit drafty, not sealing very well and most of the TV channels went out in the evening and didn't come back up until the time we left. I inquired several times at the front desk and they said they were working on it. I understand the weather was not good and may have affected it but not for as long as it was. Other than that, the stay was really really nice and comfortable."
"3016",5,"I booked The Shore Hotel for a weekend stay after a Convention in Las Vegas. I found the hotel on Trip Advisor and after reading the very favorable reviews I decided to book it.

"3018",2,"Carpet so dirty that upon entering shower the foot prints would not rinse off the tub. Laundry room directly below room would shake entire room when maids were doing laundry."
"3019",5,"My husband and I just completed a stay here and really loved it. The staff could not be more accommodating. Kitchens are really kitchens equipped a working oven. We barbequed steaks on the outside grill by the pool. However, do this before the sun goes down. There isn't much light in that area after dark. We did have small red ants upon arrival and they moved us to another, more expensive room without charge. Fantastic staff. This is really the only place to stay."
"3020",4,"Very nice hotel - mainly aimed at honeymooners. Our room was upgraded to a suite as we were on out HMoon - lovely services. Only downfall, can't go all-in as it's the USA! Food was rather pricey on site, nothing close by so best to hire a car. Overall, amazing HMoon!"
"3021",3,"We were passing through Erie for one night on our family vacation. This hotel served its purpose just fine.

Of the times I've stayed here about once a year, and each year there is some improvement over the years. It's still a cheap option for housing. I personally don't have... More"
"3023",2,"It was a recently built hotel allowed to fall into disrepair. Staff was gone or unhelpful. Room felt like a motel 6. Maybe. Was ok for 85. But no more. View of interstate exit ramp. I would recommend most other places. It did in a pinch and was close to dc. Didn't feel unsafe. Just unkept. It was fine to sleep in. And the pool was nice."
"3024",5,"Our group met in the Portico Room for a several hour business meeting. From organization, set up, lunch, and friendliness of the staff, it could not have been a better experience.

"3025",5,"This Hampton Inn is one of the friendliest hotels. It is clean, well run, and centrally located. In particular, Diana at the front desk was exceptional! She is always smiling, and willing to help in any way. We always stay at this hotel when visiting Tampa Bay Downs, and would highly recommend it."
"3026",3,"The good First let's talk about the great things at this flagship hotel and there are so many! The location is in my opinion is as good as it gets in NYC! Two blocks from Saks, Museum of Modern Art and St Patrick's Cathedral, one block from Madison Ave, three blocks from Central Park and the city's best restaurants within easy walking distance. Everything is at your fingertips! The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring, 24 carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers, all as you would expect and more. The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning! Hats off to the extraordinary designer!The rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers, crystal chandeliers, deep crown moldings, luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks, TV in the mirror, deep soaker tub, separate shower and European-style private flush. The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world. The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well. They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly. Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished. Wi-Fi is included, as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service. The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers. The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean! All the staff are friendly from the doormen, waiters, maids, valets, etc. We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection, well prepared and quickly served.The Bad Being an SPG member for 16 years with over 900 nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy. It is something we have always received at all SPG properties, 100 of the time since gaining Platinum status many, many years ago. We booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn't like they didn't know we were coming. We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade. We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec 31/15 they are useless to us now. Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded. It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade. She didn't seem to understand the Platinum perks. Talking with her was like talking to a wall, so unlike other 5-star hotels we've stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed. We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go. I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets. Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve. Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as 154 nights in one year alone with SPG. He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since 1985 when we met and had our very first trip together! Of course when you don't get a suite you don't get the toiletries that go with it which I've always loved at the St Regis. I suppose I could have requested it but I didn't. We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday.The Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week, one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court. We thought we'd stay in-house after long hours watching the Macy's Parade. Huge mistake! Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with 2 tiny bar chairs! We couldn't believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey! Not even real turkey. I couldn't understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner. Now I know! No one in their right mind would pay 400 USD for that miserable meal for two people. I can't adequately describe our disappointment. We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Year's Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid. We couldn't even eat the salads. What kind of chef can't make a salad. Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking. Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a 200 credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner! That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her. I don't think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can't blame him. It's a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a 5-star dining room! After visiting 6 other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just doesn't even make sense!Dear Katherine B,Thank you for taking the time to submit your recent review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our leadership team has been in touch with you while you were on property and again after your stay. We truly hope to regain your trust and wish you all the best for the holiday season. Kindly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"

There were red stains on.the door that seemed odd..dead bugs Building is fairly.dated but room was updated except.for the bed condition. It was not comfortable at all.

"3038",1,"Our first room had an interior door that led to the adjacent room and the lock was broken. So, we asked for another room. The next room smelled like someone had burnt a pack of cigarettes as incense in the room. We booked a non-smoking room. At that point we were just glad to have a room where all the doors locked. I would not stay here again"
"3039",4,"I've been using Trip Advisor to research hotels to stay at for our most recent holiday and again have not been disappointed. Clean room, comfy bed -what more do you need when passing through. Receive coupons from our local newspaper which helped with costs. I will stay here again...."
"3040",5,"Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service."

"3044",5,"Bad: The small breakfast was offered at an additional cost. It had limited items for a vegetarian diet. Good: I was impressed with the complementary robes and slippers and not to mention the decor is as beautiful in person as it is online!"
"3045",4,"The bathroom was too cramped the room just average. The menus were overpriced and unremarkable. The staff was courteous and responsive to requests. The fitness facility was adequate however, the lap pool is too short and too hot. The locker rooms were exceptional. The access to the Fashion Centre was an unexpected treat."
"3046",1,"I booked this room for one of my drivers and am appalled at what she reported back to me. The first room had a broken tv that wasn't even connected to the electric/cable. So as not to be blamed for the damage she requested a new room. She was given keys to another room and as she entered the room, somebody was already sleeping in it!! She apologized and went back to the front desk to request a 3rd room. She refused to go to the room without the agent going first to make sure everything was ok with it. The agent complied and came back and issued her the key. Everything seemed ok till she went in the restroom and found the toilet full of what should have flushed away! She called the front desk and reported it but nothing was done about it. This is no way to run a railroad and I won't put any of my drivers there again!!"
"3047",3,"The room was decent as far as cleanliness, however, the room was very small with two beds and there was no closet or rack to hang up your clothing. It was ok, since we were there to attend a concert and shop at outlet, so the room served the purpose. I must say the bathroom was in great shape, there was no mold or mildew in the tub and it appeared that the room and bathroom had a fresh coat of paint and the tub was new. It served the purpose"
"3048",5,"The Mills House is in a great location in the heart of Charleston's Historic District. There is a parking garage next door w/a walkway leading right to the Mills House. Once we parked the car, we had no need to move it - everything is w/i walking distance. There are several good restaurants also w/i walking distance of The Mills House.We are very pleased w/the accessibility of Hotels.com, the easy and prompt confirmation, and knowing there is someone at hand should we need them.Thank You!"
"3049",1,"What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!"

A king, a queen, a sitting area with pull out couch made everyone comfortable. Two bathrooms allowed everyone a little more time to get ready for the next day. Kitchenette was convenient to make an instant oatmeal for the next morning. Very comfortable beds. Complimentary purified chilled water near the elevator was a nice touch.Thank you, Chris9767 for choosing the River Hotel.

"3064",3,"Our experience was ok. The room felt crammed with only 2 people. I didn't like the sink being outside of the bathroom. On the first day after checking in the TV would not turn on. Problem with the remote control. Once it came on some local channels were grainy. Not very clear. On the 3rd day housekeeping didn't take out trash, clean, or make the beds. I had to take out the trash myself. They only took towels out. I went and spoke to the front desk and a few hours later someone came and cleaned and replaced the towels. The breakfast area was small for the amount of people they have staying there."

"3074",3,"There are not many places to stay in this area, so this place is a good place for the night. It certainly beats the lower-priced hotels/motels that are usually offered in remote areas. The room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. There was a buffet breakfast offered in the morning for only 8.75, but after eating it, I wished we would've held out for a Cracker Barrel or even Dunkin' Donuts."
"3075",5,"The breakfast buffet was phenomenal! The challenge was getting out of bed and get to breakfast on time!! The bed was very comfortable! Also, the breakfast staff were very hospitable. One of the chef (big guy) was wonderful at making sure we had the food we needed. He was very attentive to all guest needs. I will definitely stay again!"

"3082",4,"I originally booked a queen room but was surprised to see there were two double beds was no issue at all given the extra bed was good for space and to add I wasn't expecting a kitchenette in the room. Could have been some more toiletries and maybe cook ware and silverware but good to know next time what to bring. Front desk staff very cool and even with us waking up late and checking out a half hour after the set time there was no issue at all no one bothers about it given we did check in late.

"3112",4,"The hotel has lovely quiet rooms always cleaned and polished. The staff are friendly and efficient. Even on busy memorial weekend the place did not feel too crapped or rushed. It's sad to see their luxury 'Skies' rooftop revolving restaurant has gone bust.We had to eat dinner the first night at the 'Spectator's' bar which was awful. We went back for drinks later at night and the main bartender was rude, he fitted right into the ambiance of this nasty little nugget.The breakfast buffet is always one of the highlights of my stay at this establishment. It's reasonably priced with top quality selection and service. The terrace view is calming with all the trees and water fountains babbling in the background.The pool was just 'remodeled' for memorial weekend but as always it was over packed and there were about 15 chaise lounge chairs for a large hotel. The hotel must buy some chairs for the clients. We had to sit on the concrete both days with our 2 year old. Next time we will bring our own chairs.I talked to the staff who said the entire hotel is in a remodel phase and I'm sure they will address these minor details. I may have griped a bit that I still love the hotel it just needs some minor adjustments. If your with family and need a dinner just go down to the Westin through The Link they have a bar/restaurant that actually has main courses and cooked food with vegetables."
"3113",2,"Bad: At the arrival, we paid the parking fee in cash (43) and the rest of the amount for two nights stay with a credit card. Checking the transactions during the last couple of days we realized that the parking fee has been charged on the credit card TOO. We asked for an explanation and have not received any answer at all. It's simply unacceptable. The room furniture is old, need a renovation. The space around all windows - both in the room and the shower - and the windows themselves were very dirty. Basically no choice for breakfast - consisted of two types of cereal, boiled eggs, white and whole grain bread. Good: Coffee machine available at all the time free."
"3114",5,"I was hesitant staying here but I am extremely happy I did, our room was a very spacey corner double and it had a wonderful view. Customer service was incredible, Kathy was able to check us in a little earlier and I forgot his name but made a mean bacon and egg croissant sandwich. Hotel is in a great location 2 blocks away from Bourbon and one from Canal. Close to everything but far enough to hear all the noise. I would definitely stay there again especially for the great rate we got.Thanks so much for your review! I always enjoy sharing comments like these with our staff and giving Kathy and our cook, Mike the kudos they deserve.

"3119",5,"We were there for only two nights, but we were extremely pleased. The meeting halls for our conference were great, our room was wonderfully comfortable, clean, and well-furnished, and most importantly the hospitality and courtesy shown to us as guests tops that of any other hotel we've ever stayed at. This hotel is right at a metro station for two lines that go straight into the downtown area, and is only 3 minutes from the airport. It's also connected to a wonderful mall. In all, the only word to describe the experience is, well, perfect!"
"3120",5,"I can't comment on the breakfast because we slept through it but everything else was excellent! I dont know why anyone would pay twice the price to stay at the Gaylord. 5 stars all the way!"
"3121",4,"We came to Maui to get married and were recommended this place by a colleague at my work. We rented a one bedroom condo and I have to say it is beautiful Very happy with our condo. I read some reviews by others about the lack of cleaning service, but we have not had that experience during our stay here.... More"
"3122",5,"Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home! Best Hotel in NYC- have stayed in many , luxury and not,in NYC and all over the world. Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home. Our Signature Butler service differentiates us from the competition, and we are thrilled that you were able to experience this first hand.We look forward to welcoming you back to New York again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih Geray"
"3123",5,"Here for business meetings, had some glitches with services like wifi and AV but we're fixed immediately, even though they were our mistakes not the hotel's. Others have pointed out interior vs exterior rooms. Rooms are spacious with floor butler at your service. Awesome!Thank you very much for your recent review on TripAdvisor. We truly appreciate you taking the time to detail your experience, and we are so pleased that you had a wonderful visit at The St. Regis New York. We will share your comments about our business accommodations with our team members, and we grateful of your praises.We look forward to welcoming you back as our guest in the near future!"
"3124",1,"My family decided to stay here the night after spending the day at Virginia beach before heading home. The hotel seemed ok and clean and all was well until about 1am. A couple arrived in the room next to ours and were fighting. It got so loud I had to call the front desk and while I was doing this the women was screaming that she was being beat. There was a lot of banging around and the manager along with someone else came up right away. They proceeded to call the police but when they got there the man had already left. This was a very traumatic experience for my wife and kids and management did not even try to talk to us about it. This was not an experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel. I know some things can't be controlled but management should have followed up on this. Based on this experience I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
"3125",5,"Recently had a 2 night stay for a business meeting. The hotel facility was very nice and the staff very friendly. The pool was closed for renovations but scheduled to reopen. Central to a number of Harrisburg attractions."
"3126",4,"I stayed there with my daughter and nephew and after reading the reviews I wasn't expecting much. I guess that's the good part because it was no where near as bad as I thought it was going to be. Our room was clean, had a microwave and refrigerator which not all rooms have apparently. Everyday the room was nicely made,... More"
"3127",5,"The staff, location , room, enjoyed our stay ."
"3128",5,"Stayed here for a short stay in Chicago - easy for travel as it's no more than a five minute walk from Jackson Station on the blue line from the airport.The hotel is conveniently located for downtown locations - some such as Sears Tower are within easy walking distance while others are no more than a short cab ride or a hop on the blue or red line away.While not huge the room we had was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. The staff were friendly and helpful.My only minor moan would be that we made the booking well in advance and the room rate seemed to be a good bit higher than that quoted on-line by the hotel just before we left."
"3129",2,"Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service. I think the Do Not Disturb sign with the young guy in his under ware hugging a teddy bear says it all."
"3130",4,"Fabulous fun at a great hotel in the middle of the French Quarter! Friendly, helpful staff, lovely clean, comfortable room. Right in the middle of all the action, it was our base for a group visit to the Nola jazz festival. Great to know that after a very full day you could come back to such a lovely home. I... More"
"3131",4,"We didn't get to take advantage of the outdoor amenities because it was so cold all weekend. The kids definitely want to go again when it is warm. Very friendly and helpful staff! Great location out of the way of the congestion."
"3132",5,"I thought the overall experience at the hotel was very good. The only thing I did not like was that the cleaning of the room was late in the day after 2pm."
"3133",5,"Stayed 1 night and found this gem perfect for our needs. The owner/ manager was friendly and accommodating. I've gave me his coffee mug when I told him I was a styrofoam cup snob. ( I hate drinking hot coffee from styrofoam.) No hair dryer in the rooms, but just ask the manager and he'll get one for you. If... More"
"3134",5,"The hotel is located within a stone's throw away from the wonderful Seattle Center. From there it's easy to get into downtown with the monorail and for us it was quite easy to even walk to downtown. Also the hotel even offers transport to downtown tourist destinations free of charge (need to book ahead). The room was nicely furbished, the... More"
"3135",5,"very nice resort to spend a weekend with a family or just someone special rooms are very nice. around the resort very nice volleyball and small sandy beach but also nice fire pit for the evening. and easy to get to the dells from here. its a must place to check out."

"3138",4,"After a long drive we arrived to a great welcome friendly staff and free coffee!! Quick check in and very spacious rooms equipped with all necessities. Breakfast was lush could eat as much as you want and my partner ate about 4 helpings of different things!! We walked down to the beach the steps were quite a lot but we... More"
"3139",4,"Bad: There was loud music playing at night and in the morning. Luckily I'm a heavy sleeper so it didn't really bother me. Good: Great location in Miami Beach (south). Close to all the action but off the main stretch so it's more peaceful. Near to lots of shops. There was an issue with our room and we had to spend one night in their sister hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful to make sure we were comfortable. The hotel offers a portable wifi hotspot for guests to take out with them - very cool!"
"3140",5,"Construction across the street Nice location"
"3141",4,"Modern looking hotel. Room lay out worked for smaller space. I thought is was weird that the door to the room opened directly into the bathroom. Didn't like that there was no self park, but I believe all hotels in downtown New Orleans have that.You'd be correct, most downtown NOLA properties are valet only. We understand Aloft isn't for everyone but truly appreciate you giving us a try. Thanks for staying! Yours in hospitality, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"3142",3,"Great selection of beers on tap. Salads are fresh and tasty, burgers and sandwiches are okay but too much grease. Ordered Teriyaki bowl swimming in oil like a stew - returned it."
"3143",3,"Nice hotel, but showing some signs of wear such as carpet stains and nicks on the desk. A significant upgrade would be cement to the parking area instead of stepping stones. Pretty hard to pull a suitcase over stepping stones. The pool was clean and sparkling though we did not try it out. The location was back from the highway... More"
"3144",5,"A perfect location for a weekend excursion from NYC. This hotel is approximately 20 mins from two NY wineries one being the Brotherhood Winery which is the oldest in the USA. This Hampton Inn has a delightful all-American all-you-eat breakfast buffet. This Inn is a great value for your money and the location. Also pet-friendly."
"3145",1,"It was the worst experience. We booked from hotels.com but the motel employee did not update the status of the room and we got the room didnot have hot water for shower.w hen we call to front desk they said they knew it and still they have us the room. No responsibility at all."
"3146",3,"My only issue is that I have expierienced better Wyndham hotels for cheaper prices in my area. Bigger rooms to bigger in-room jacuzzi units to better overall atmosphere to the room. Service or cleanliness was not lacking here just overall quality of rooms compared to other Wyndham hotels."
"3147",5,"Upon arrival at this Best Western property, all staff members did 100 effort to make our stay comfortable. Great tips on local dining spots that turned to some of the best food we had on this trip. Great access from Interstate gets you on and off the road quick. Also a great breakfast to start your day."
"3148",5,"Very good stay with lots of energy."
"3149",5,"This was the second LaQuinta we stayed at it was very nice. We would stay there anytime. Because we have a dog it makes it even nicer because most hotels that allow pets are not that clean."
"3150",2,"Very disappointed in cleanliness of the room and daily cleaning. Greeted by indifferent desk clerks...not close to good restaurants. The renovation which has apparently been going on for a long time meant there was clutter in the entrance and hallways."
"3151",2,"clean room but not a good one...over the mechanical room and noisy.....broken shower head bracket which fell on my wife's foot....impossible to get breakfast in the morning with long line up and no food...no front desk support to solve problems"
"3152",4,"My family and I went to Windham mountain for 4 days and just wanted a simple place to sleep. The owners were very nice and even provide a simple (think cereal and coffee), breakfast. The rooms were simple and clean and just what we needed. The only drawback was that the walls are very thin and you can hear conversations... More"
"3153",2,"I know this is an old building. The rooms are not sound proof. I heard very clearly the conversation the mother was having with her children in the next room. The shower did not get hot, warm enough, but not hot."
"3154",2,"My daughter and I checked in late after driving all day. The room we were originally set to be in was marked as not ready in the system, so we were assigned to a larger room. When we got into the room, overall, everything appeared to be clean. However, when we went to the bathroom to turn on the shower, we noticed that the shower/tub had not been cleaned (or if it had, it was not done well). There were several dark hairs still in the bathtub, as well as small stumbles from a man. This was quite disgusting and not what we wanted to deal with at the late hour. I did my best to wash out and wipe down the tub, but we quickly showered with our flip flops on and went to bed. In the morning, we woke up and checked out quickly because it just felt dirty in the room. I did let the clerk know about our room upon checkout, and she stated that she would let the head of cleaning know."
"3155",1,"Stayed at this hotel with their package deal of renting a room and leaving your car in the parking lot for a price of 159.99 while you fly away. Car was broken into and they refuse to pay for the damages. No responsibility. do not stay here do not trust them.Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, the airport market has had a recent wave of car vandalism. With the help of police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we fortunately have been able to stop these car break-ins. We understand how frustrating this situation is and again would like to extend our apologies. We want you to know that we will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe."
"3156",4,"This best western is the next best thing to the casino maybe even equal comfort that's close to the boardwalk. I have been staying at this location for years. I even have a favorite room. They since have remodeled and it's really nice modern decor. It's generally inexpensive, but can sometimes be the same rate as the casinos because of its popularity. I always enjoy my stay and it's close to everything. One block from the boardwalk. There is a seven eleven across the street that has everything. There is a rite aid, liquor store, restaurants and laundromat few steps away. Highly recommend this location and nice staff in the lobby."
"3157",5,"I have stayed at several places for both business and pleasure over the last 12 months and this was one of the very top stays. I was VERY surprised that a small town had a place of the stature. I was staying for my Granddaughter's wedding but will be back very soon. It was GREAT."
"3158",3,"I have visited this hotel twice now. On the first, I enjoyed a king-size bed and a clean room however, on my second visit to this hotel I found that the bedspread had a visible stain on it as soon as I entered the door. The towels which were meant to be white didn't appear to have been bleached at all, so they were dingy. On the floor leading to the bathroom was a red stain which I cringe to imagine what it consisted of. Overall, the room wasn't as clean as the one I enjoyed on the first visit."
"3159",4,"Great staff at this hotel. It's in a nice location too. The hotel is dated, but I very much enjoyed the breakfast at Denny's (ask for Ceci) as Best Western will give rewards members a free breakfast or 6.00 off another breakfast entree at Denneys. Bertha was fantastic as check in. She accommodated my special requests and took me to 3 rooms to let me decide as I told her I was super picky. Pierre and Michael and Darby were also super kind and helpful. Michael is very knowledgeable about wineries. Darby helped me with restaurants, and Pierre was also helpful and offered any additional assistance he could. Pierre had coffee made SUPER early which is great as I was up at 4 or 4:30 each day. It was nice he was there to greet me and there was decaf and coffee made early. They need to update the rooms, but the business center was nice with 2 computers and the exercise room and laundry facility was all right there too--super convenient. The price was high, but I guess all the prices are high at Napa. I'd recommend the location too. Thanks!"
"3160",2,"the hotel was beautiful! the staff friendly but the room was missing a few amenities such as no cream or sugar for coffee. Bell man left me in the hotel lobby with a full cart, 2 kids and a small dog in crate, after i had tipped him to take me upstairs. I had to manage by myself. Manager was very nice and gave us a comp breakfast buffet."

"3163",5,"Bad: Breakfast could have been better. Who likes fake eggs and turkey sausage A bit nasty! We were on third floor when we needed 2- 1st floor rooms. There were a lot of empty 1st floor rooms. A lot of stairs with a lot of luggage and 1 grandma who has leg problems. Good: Beds were great. Very comfortable. Hotel was very clean. Staff was very helpful. Room cleaners did a great job! We were in rooms 339 and 340 for a week. Never saw any bugs! Plenty of towels!"

"3165",4,"Clean hotel, friendly service, but breakfast isn't included. This hotel is located outside BWI airport, which is great if you're flying out of BWI. But being about 10 or so miles outside Baltimore, it made it extremely inconvenient to get to downtown Baltimore from here. The light-rail train took us almost an hour from Penn Station, and that was just to get to BWI, not even to the area where all the hotels are. Really inconvenient without a car."
"3166",3,"Rudeness at front desk. When we checked in the front desk person was unfriendly and short of patience with my hard of hearing issue. We witnessed a very insulting exchange from a front desk person to another guest. Housekeepers were very pleasant and helpful. Rooms were small and did not seem up to the Doubletree standard we have seen in other Doubletree hotels."
"3167",5,"Smile and help at every turn. Clean, Comfortable, Great Breakfast, but the staff was the gem of this stay! Thought I had a reservation,DIDN'T!

"3173",4,"Room was small and kind of noisy (on highway side). It is an old hotel, so not a place to go if you like squeaky clean new stuff. However, it does have character. The breakfast was good.

"3179",5,"I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about. Consistent and friendly staff that makes The St Regis our home away form home. We really love it.Dear Kenneth,Thank you so much for taking the time to not only share your feedback regarding your most recent visit, but also to be so detailed and generous with your comments about our team members. Molly, Shelomie, Hugo, Krista, McKinley, Marianna, Kevin, and Juan are indeed amongst our most stellar performers and we could not be happier to learn that they made your and Ryne's visit enjoyable and memorable.

"3185",4,"Every thing was good. Could use a bit of a facelift but not critical. Pool looked nice but did not have time to use."
"3186",4,"We were in town for a Lego League Competition at UTEP. We reserved the hotel for the pool. And of course, it was closed for maintenance when we checked in. It did open the next day, but the pool was why we chose to pay 40 more per night. Service was ok- not outstanding, but not bad either. Just normal service. There were only about 10 channels on the TV and nothing for kids (so I had no pool or TV for the first night after a long day of work and traveling). But the hotel is close to a shopping center and not too far from UTEP so it worked well for what we needed."

"3204",4,"Staff was awesome, location was great and it was a great value compared to other hotels in downtown Charleston. Parking is so bad in Charleston its worth staying somewhere on the peninsula so you don't have to try and find parking. Hotel offered very convenient valet service too."
"3205",3,"Bad: I didn't care for the fact that we had to keep asking for the simple things such as, towels, sheets, glasses. Had to have them clean the tub before we even step foot in it because it was black at the bottom. Had to request that the garbage be emptied. Maintenance was called twice, once for the toilet and another because the air conditioning wasn't working. I would think for a hotel that charges you IN FULL for your stay before you leave the check in counter would be on top of things making their guests happier. Good: The view and location of the hotel was perfect and breakfast was nice except for the juices... The hotel outdoor pool was nice but the bar wasn't fully stocked and the food was HORRIBLE."
"3206",5,"I stayed for one night with a couple friends. We were in town for a concert. The hotel was clean, conveniently located, nice, and a good value. Hotel staff were helpful and friendly."

"3208",5,"Bad: Nada. Good: Amenities, staff, decor, room"
"3209",5,"Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu."
"3210",4,"This hotel was convenient for everything we had planned. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The hotel was a little dated, however was clean and comfortable."
"3211",4,"I wanted to stay overnight for the Air Show there were 600,000 people in AC, so I knew we would have to pay top dollar to stay anywhere. All the Casinos were booked and all the board walk properties were also booked with the exception of the 2 star Days Inn which wanted 280 per night. I decided to go for the best western 129 even though I had read some questionable reviews. We were suprised at how nice the hotel looked. It was clean nice tiled bathroom new looking carpet on hall floors and in the room. The AC in our room worked fine and was on when we got there. There was a nice sized frige, coffee machine and blow dryer. The halls were warm because windows were open (no AC on). We had a great complimentary breakfast in the morning including fresh make your own belgium waffels, bagles, pastries, muffins juices and coffee. Staff was friendly and helpful. Being a city girl I was definately on my guard walking the one long block from the boardwalk at night 1AM but it was well lit and had several clubs and resturants along the way. It is also centrally located to all the Casinos and the beach has a boardwalk entryway with a rinse off shower and public bathrooms."
"3212",5,"After several trips to Vegas each year for the last several years The Aria remains one of my favorites. Classy place with great features. Very centrally located so you can get to many shows and other casinos."
"3213",4,"Hotel in it self are ok, a little warn down, but lacks parking spaces. It was completely full when I arrived at 21:15."
"3214",3,"Great breakfast buffet each morning. Definitely adds value to the price. But otherwise, not a great stay. I think their cleaning crew must be understaffed. One day they didn't take out our trash or give us bath rugs or hand towels. The six of us in a two bedroom suite shared towels and used a washcloth -- a washcloth! -- for a rug. The next day we didn't get any maid service at all! At 6:00 pm, we went downstairs and asked for our own towels. The little market store downstairs was sold out of bottled water for two of our five day stay. Not having water after a long day of city walking was a real disappointment. And there is no easy market or store within walking distance, so we were chugging tap water. Yuck. My son got sick one night, so we hoped for ginger ale or Sprite or something to settle his stomach. Nope. All they had was Mountain Dew.The location across from Lake Union was pretty, but not convenient for downtown activities. We had to wait up to 20 minutes for an Uber driver during peak hours. That was poor planning on my part to book here, but I had no idea that Uber would be so difficult. Despite the challenges, we did have a decent stay. Our two room suite was spacious and comfortable. And again, the breakfast was really fantastic.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your recent stay with us and providing your honest feedback. On behalf of our team, I apologize we fell short of meeting our expectations but most importantly yours. It is guest as yourself who help improve our hotel and provide better service in the future. I apologize for the inconvenience of your downtown travels in Seattle. However, I am glad you were comfortable in our luxurious two-bedroom suite. Respectfully,"
"3215",3,"Location is awesome and walking distance from a lot of great bars, restaurants and a mall. Besides that the quality of the hotel didn't really live up its price-level. Staff was friendly but poorly trained. Just little things like an employee hijacking an elevator down to parking as I was trying to go up and another one at the front... More"
"3216",3,"What I didn't like was the room was not good. When you walk in the hotel it looks awesome. But the room looked like you were in a motel rather than a hotel. Also the hotel was under construction from 9am to 7pm. That would have been nice to know before booking a room. The hotel staff were very polite and professional. The breakfast bar was the best breakfast bar I have had in a Hotel. Out of a 1-5, I rate the breakfast bar a 5. The staff were so on point."
"3217",3,"Older motel.Iffie room but you get value for your money. Safe neighborhood.Close to metro rail transport. Great staff (Salima from Marocco) The free breakfeast was worldclass.Totally upperclass !. If you want value for money in DC this is a great choice."
"3218",5,"Great service, safe and overall excellent. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The young lady at the front desk printed some directions for me. The location was perfect, right by the freeway. I would stay again."
"3219",4,"We visited the Sanibel Inn whilst on holiday in Naples as we'd spent a day on the Island the year before. The Inn was in a great location. Just as you get onto the Island with a beautiful approach to reception. We were a little early to check in so had a wander around and a drink at the welcoming... More"
"3220",5,"The staff was very friendly and helpful, responding quickly to requests. The facilities were comfortable and clean and we appreciated the little snack on arrival. Breakfast was tasty with good options."
"3221",4,"Cozy room and vibe to this place... many food options close by.. minutes from Fenway Park and the house of blues"
"3222",5,"We were welcomed with cold drinks and a smiling friendly receptionist and manager as we looked tired after walking from the station. They asked why we had not rung for the shuttlebus (we tried but we had called the wrong number). We always used it since (the driver was NOT the smiling type). The continental breakfast was nearer a full breakfast as there were some cooked items."
"3223",5,"Celebrated our 32nd anniversary . Beautiful views,huge pool and jacuzzi . Great staff. May return for our 33rd"
"3224",2,"Wants to charge extra for everything. Micro wave, Refrigirator and glass of water. Have to wait 15 minutes to get hot water. Also another 15 minutes to bath tub water to drain. We book all most 25 rooms all the same story with bath tub."
"3225",2,"Do NOT make a reservation with Best Western. When in the Carolinas or in Walterboro, get a coupon and save 20. I do not know if there is a high season but during our visit in early March there were clearly lots of empty rooms."
"3226",2,"The first room we were given had a smell like a wet dog, blanket was dirty and room was not real clean. We were given a second room, it also smelled, but as if someone had just cleaned this room. No coffee pot, however, there was coffee in the room, the carpet had not been cleaned well as there was...

"3227",5,"Our experience at Rancho Valencia was absolutely perfect from beginning to end!!!! We felt special and very happy during our stayed. I would come back in a heart beat!!!"
"3228",5,"Everything went as planned. Nice free breakfast. The free WiFi was a bit slow, the TV/Cable had some quirks but was manageable (no HD). The pool was bath temperature (Very Warm!). Shower had nice pressure, and the beds were firm but not hard. We had a problem one night with the lock on the bathroom door and the folks at the front desk were helpful."
"3229",4,"The rooms are standard motel rooms but extremely clean and well maintained. The location is great for fishing or rafting on the east branch of the Delaware River. Plus it is easy to get to the West Branch or the Beaverkill"
"3230",5,"Staff was very nice and friendly, quick check in and check out, good variety offered for breakfast, good location. Only inconvenience on the weekend our family stayed there was a convention happening at the hotel on the Friday evening which made the lobby area were crowded and noisy."
"3231",3,"The bed was not comfortable. The shower was nice"
"3232",4,"Bad: The room rate was terrible we had a Booking.com rate that was not honoured it soured the stay and was a big difference. We to date have no explanation!. Good: Location"
"3233",3,"I was expecting a more welcoming attitude from the reception. Some of them were nice but there is one guy who was very serious and never smiled. I didn't understand if he had a bad time or this is simply his personality. The floor I stayed on had a little bit of unfresh air on the entrance. I stayed before and room condition was better. Also one time shuttle service took more than one hour to arrive for pickup. We waited from 3:30 pm to 4:40 pm we called at 3:20 pm but looks like they skipped one pick-up turn."
"3234",5,"We had absolutely no complaints about our stay at Home 2! the staff went out of their way to assure we were happy during our stay. The suite was roomy, clean and well decorated, with the best bed we have ever slept on in a hotel!"
"3235",4,"We recently stayed one night at the SeacCrest Oceanfront Hotel on our way down the coast after driving the Big Sur and visiting Hearst Castle. Although we only spent one night at the hotel it was very pleasant with our ground floor room opening onto the rear garden that lead down to the beach. The beach was lovely with good... More"

"3237",4,"We stayed one night after a full day of touring and driving. The staff were friendly and the room was clean - though a bit dated and in need of some service (a lamp was burned out). The breakfast was very tasty and the fella who was stocking was very attentive and helpful. Overall, a good stay."
"3238",2,"The room was not well maintained. The bathroom floor looked like it hadn't been swept or cleaned in a while. The room looked like it never had a real deep cleaning. The Towels in the bathroom where a grungy gray. It is not a well kept property. The breakfast pantry had a foul odor coming from it. I realize that... More"

"3240",2,"Was promised early check-in...didn't get it. One room was partially cleaned. Restaurant was extremely slow, the food was mediocre and pricey. Internet was really slow. Self parking for only 24 per day. Four or five star priced hotel for a two star (at the most) venue."
"3241",4,"Bad: Had wifi problems for the first 4 nights. The resort fee is a bit of a scam. Good: Very comfortable bed, good sized room, well appointed gym and free parking."
"3242",2,"Arrived and had prev reqd a king or queen suite and was given a wheelchair accessible dble. And was told that's all they had. However a couple that were friends of mine later called and made a reserv and recvd a king suite! Additionally our heat was broken all week end and it was quite chilly. They attempted to repair twice w/no luck."

The rooms are modern with very comfortable beds. The lobby and bar area are modern and elegant. Despite the number of floors and... More"
"3250",3,"My room or hallway didnt smell funny, the staff was friendly helpful, and there wasn't any loud noises or unruly guests. I had hotwater and the heater worked. As far as the room itself, you get what you pay for..No hangers, old furniture poor tv reception/wifi. The bed was comfortable enough. If you just need a place to crash or need to save this place works. Things that made me giggle: the phone in the room was from the Marriot in another state, the sheet that had the list of tv channels had a different hotel name on it, the advertisement for a pizza place that will deliver to your room has relocated and no longer does the keycard does not have the Inn's name on it but does have another pizza advertisement (different place) all over it again says they will deliver to your room, ya, no its out of the area."
"3251",5,"My husband and I decided to head South to spend our April 2018 birthdays in New Orleans. Our stay at the Troubadour was perfect. The entire staff (especially Jalen at the front desk and bellman) made our trip memorable and worth a return stay. This will be our home away from home whenever we're visiting New Orleans. Oh, and the buffet was simply marvelous!Thank you very much for choosing The Troubadour to celebrate your birthdays with us and we are delighted to know you had such a great time. We will be sure to share this among our team so they know their efforts did not go unnoticed and we do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"3252",5,"Bad: The eggs was nasty."
"3253",5,"In town for soccer tournament, beds were soft, rooms were clean, It was a great stay."
"3254",5,"The name inn really does not represent them and devalues their name. Resort would probably fit better because of all the amenities and all that they have to offer. We were married there in 2012 and stayed there multiple times since 2010, so maybe we are biased)"
"3255",5,"Bad: Shuttle services to the strip because older people may have problems with feet problems which I do. Good: Everything"
"3256",3,"Bad: There was not a dinette set in the room so that my husband and I could eat comfortably. The room was much smaller than I thought it was and there was no safe to put valuables in when we went out. I was not comfortable leaving any thing of value in my room. There was no outdoor pool as stated by you and there was no jacuzzi. Breakfast food was cold and not tasty at all. I don't feel like I got my money's worth from this resort and I will not be staying at Spring Hill Suites ever again. Good: I liked the king size bed."

"3259",4,"My sister I were only in town for a day so we didn't need a lot of service when we were at the hotel. However, it did meet our requirements. The room was very clean, the woman at the front desk was polite professional when we checked in. We were very pleased with our short little stay. All we every ask is that the rooms are clean, the staff is respectful, it to be quiet. I will say that there were a lot of children. I don't know if this hotel is a vacation destination hotel because the amount of children was a little daunting. Granted, it is summer they do have a pool. The halls were still fairly quiet while we were on our way to check out, the room next to ours had a bunch of children in it we never had a problem with the noise level so I think it's safe to say the walls are pretty thick."
"3260",5,"this is the place to stay if you need a room at the base of the mountain,and want to spend a few days visiting the mountains .The free breakfast may make you want to have a nap they have lots of good stuff to eat . Its a good hotel and location for the price"

"3262",5,"My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for 8 nights in June 2018 as part pleasure part business trip. This was our second time at the hotel and we cannot fault it. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very memorable. The hotel's location made it great to get around the City and the friendliness of the staff made our time there very enjoyable. Janelle in the fitness centre was a particular favourite of ours as she made going to the gym in the mornings a very welcoming and friendly experience.

"3263",4,"the room/bath was clean and airy, price OK (late March) and free breakfast fine. we had some room mechanical problems (door lock, heater cover) but they were fixed. We toured Butte homse and mining and needed a quiet place to collapse at night - this place fit the need."
"3264",4,"The hotel was average. It's conveniently located close to bwi where they offer a shuttle service to and from the airport (that means no paying to park) hotel staff was so so. Not very friendly. The shuttle driver was cool even at 4am."

Each time maintenance has to fix it. I don't understand why the first nigjt I have to sleep sweating or cold because the air or heat is not working properly. I think the hotel must control the utilities from a central unit and they do not adjust the temperature for you until you complain. Otherwise, the hotel is lovely. Expect to pay a whopping 32 per night for parking. Unbelievable!"

"3315",1,"Rooms were large, bed was comfortable, location was adequate. Motel needs some serious updates. Renovations are a must. Outside area was dirty and customers were allowed to work on their automobiles in the parking lots. My spouse and I will not again stay again without some of these things are fixed."
"3316",5,"Stayed here in October after running the Tough Mudder race in Coatsville. Staff was super helpful and enthusiastic. Breakfast was awesome. The room was spacious, quiet, clean, and well appointed. Nice place."
"3317",4,"Reason for stay was to catch flight early am. Location is excellent to airport. Shuttle service efficient, although was somewhat crowded leaving. Return was very good. Also, hotel is close to restaurant I love to visit. Overall very good experience!"
"3318",3,"We stayed here before a Saints game with kids. Pros: Location was perfect for this - room was clean and large and the kids loved the games in the bar. The bar staff was particularly helpful and friendly. Cons: the front desk is understaffed and really slow, both check-in and check-out. The breakfast area ran out of almost all items and closed early. The hotel screwed up our pre-arranged late checkout and locked us out, and then gave us the wrong key TWICE. Long story, but the whole mix up ended up costing us 45+ minutes.Well that's certainly not the experience we hope to provide. We will be sure to share your feedback with our front office to ensure this is not an ongoing issue. We do hope you give us another shot next season! WHODAT!!Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
"3319",5,"Bad: Nothing . Good: Really nice casino brew pub hotel rooms were massive and clean great location for fremount street and affordable drink and food prices easy to get to the strip using local transport"
"3320",5,"Excellent"
"3321",4,"We had no problems staying here and were treated very good. We would stay here again in a minute. The staff was very helpful in letting us know where to go and have a great meal. The rooms were big and had everything we needed. The beds were very comfortable."
"3322",3,"The beds, pillows and linens were fine. The A/C and other pipe noises were loud and you could hear everything going on in the hallway. The tub filled from a shower and took forever to drain. Furniture is worn and dated. Beach was great and so was the pool. For the price and since we knew we wouldn't be in the room much, it was okay but next trip to Virginia Beach we'll try a different place."
"3323",5,"FIrst trip to Vegas and we had heard everyone rave about this place, so we decided to book it. First impression....WOW...absolutely gorgeous. We aren't much for gambling, but this place had a huge casino, and tons of great restaurants and bars. The place is impeccable. Room service was great and the rooms totally state of the art. We booked through... More"
"3324",3,"Bad: Room and bed were tiny - not even a queen bed. Bed took up most of the room. Breakfast was coffee and a bunch of cold bagels. Bathroom was also tiny. Not worth the exhorbitant price at all. Good: Location was good."
"3325",1,"The lobby looked nice and half way updated. Checked in got into room and immediately the smell of musty air conditioner, decor was outdated nothing close to the lobby and the first floor. Oh and there is no elevator and as you walk up the steps to the 2nd floor you see the paint and trim on the walls peeling... More"
"3326",2,"The room was ok. The hall way was under construction so we heard constant banging all night. One of the hotel staff just walked into our room no knocking and then stared at us blankly asking if we had checked in. The wifi didn't work the front desk gave us a 1800 number to call so we could ask them to reset it. I would not stay here again."
"3327",4,"Bad: Walls are very thin, be prepared to hear your neighbors."
"3328",5,"Rooms were clean, comfy, relaxing on the balcony listening to the creek.Everything was great, had a great time.Service was excellent. If I had more time We would of stayed longer. Coming back in June. Yeay!"
"3329",4,"Nice hotel with the that price.. Breakfast was served well.."
"3330",4,"Spacious and clean room. Very comfortable and firm bed with down pillows and comforter. We had no problem connecting to the free WiFi. Little luxuries in the room included a Keurig machine, k-cups and a mini fridge. We arrived after 1:00 AM and someone was still at the front desk to greet us. There is a nice little area next to the front desk where they sell snacks, drinks (including beer) and basic toiletry items. The indoor pool is open 6:00am - 11:00pm - didn't get to experience it but it looked very nice - there is also a hot tub. Made reservation for a smoking room however, the entire building is smoke free FYI. There is breakfast served next to the lobby area in the morning - there is a continental breakfast (6.95) or a breakfast buffet (9.95). We had the buffet and it was very good - you can order custom omelets and they had biscuits, sausage gravy, bacon, sausage, grits and eggs all hot and ready. There is also milk, juice, and soda available. We also liked the late check-out time (12 noon) since we got in so late. We would definitely stay here again - overall, very happy we picked this hotel!"
"3331",4,"Exactly as you would expect from Holiday Inn Express. No surprises. Solid property, staff and amenities."
"3332",5,"Where do I Start!!! :) We had the most amazing stay at this beautiful property. We arrived Dec 3rd and were greeted by the awesome frontdesk staff. I had stayed at this property a year ago and loved it so much that I decided to bring my girlfriend with me on this trip for some relaxation. We were upgraded to... More"
"3333",4,"We were heading out early the next morning, so we did a quick overnight here. Hotel was clean and comfortable. Price was reasonable. Housekeeping responded quickly. The restaurant is mostly a grab-n-go type establishment, but the food was good."
"3334",5,"Loved this condo property. Nice amenities unit was very clean and spacious. Would certainly recommend especially for families with kids"
"3335",3,"It was a good hotel to spend for only one night there. The Wi-Fi didn't reach very well upstairs. Although, I overheard the staff indicate they were working on it. The hot water for the shower wasn't that hot or didn't have the potential to get that hot which could be good in a sense. I filled up an ice bucket and left it out overnight. The next morning, I discovered a dead cockroach. I don't know if that was a fluke, but that kind of shocked me a bit. I don't think bugs in general are very good. The area was quiet which was important to get some good sleep. The free breakfast was really good, the staff was super friendly, and the shuttle got me to the BWI airport fast. Overall, I think it's a good place, but needs a few things fixed. I recommend on the contingency those issues are fixed."
"3336",4,"Very nice comfortable guest room. The beds are comfortable to the point of wanting to know what mattresses they use. You have the choice of firm or soft pillows-at least in the room we had. Quiet surroundings which help get a good nights sleep. Perfect getaway hotel in great location! Just off I-90 and Randall Rd. so its easy to... More"
"3337",1,"Stay away from this place. It is a dirty roach Motel!! It seems like the place is more like low income housing for homeless people and drug users then a hotel for tourists-visitors. The rooms were dirty and smelled. There were people smoking weed and doing drugs in the parking lot. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
"3338",5,"I came to know that this motel is newly renovated so I wanted to check it out. The rate was very reasonable. I found that the room was clean and comfortable (I stayed for 7 nights) and the room included a microwave and fridge. They had smoking and non smoking rooms which I was pleased with since other motels near... More"
"3339",5,"Good: Westin has always the most comfortable beds"
"3340",3,"Good - Large, essentially one-bedroom apartments. Bad - Aged, and poorly designed. The soft shell of the tub enclosure dipped between the joists when I stood in it. Good - Nice neighborhood. Bad - practically impossible to get a cab on time. Good - housekeeping staff goes out of their way. Bad - Front desk is horrible. They lack procedure, training and capability. Simple tasks were challenging. Don't count on getting a cab through the front desk unless you have 30-60 minutes to wait for one. Call the cab company yourself and make certain they have your name so some other frustrated customer doesn't take your cab. Good - they run a shuttle from the hotel to the Metro. Bad - there is no schedule and you have to look carefully for when they don't run, when they are doing a grocery store run, or when they are running to another facility they service. The Metro is across the street and down half a block from where they drop you off and pick you up. Since you don't know the schedule, you're standing on the street waiting. Dress appropriately and take an umbrella. There is no restaurant in the building. But there is a call in service which delivers food from many restaurants. I recommend this hotel IF you have your own car, are flexible about the age of the building, and don't rely on any services from the front desk."
"3341",1,"We stayed here due to close proximity to where we were going. Online, it appeared to be the best of the 3 in this small town. We didn't expect a 4 or 5 star... But we did expect a clean place to catch some sleep. Fairly run down and I can understand that in a small town, but there's no... More"
"3342",4,"This is quite a special hotel. It is unique in many ways its design, layout and furnishings are a pleasant change from the hotel norm. You feel comfortable in your room and the staff add to the level of comfort and welcome.Thank you for your comments...we certainly try our best to make it a special place. We hope you come back and enjoy it on another trip!"
"3343",5,"We loved everything about the trip. Oak Creek Canyon was beautiful and Slide Rock was amazing! The hotel was great. We loved going out on the patio at night to drink tea and look at the shadows on the beautiful red rocks."
"3344",4,"Great over night stop, truck and trailer parking, pet friendly, easy access. The art in the hallways looks like they bought it from the discount pile at a poster store in the mall. It's really quite an amusing bunch of wall art."
"3345",5,"This motel is clean, quiet, has A/C, flatscreen TV/cable, and well lit parking. It also has free wi-fi... Which I am using right now. Best of all, for a non-special Sunday night, we paid 58 for 2 adults, 2 children. Decor Style Who cares.... The bed and room are comfortable."
"3346",5,"Very nice hotel, clean and cozy! Beds was very comfortable! We in joy to stay this place! Thank you"
"3347",4,"I have stayed in this hotel 5 times. It has always been clean, the staff is friendly, it has been a great value. The breakfast has been good for my family. There have been several options for the family. If they left hungry, it was their own fault. We will definitely stay here again. The armbands for the amusement park... More"
"3348",2,"The staff were attentive and welcoming. The river view lovely. The room was not comfortable. The bed needed replacement as did the linens. The space was taken up with long shelves w pillows. Seating would be better ."
"3349",4,"The hotel played loud music in common areas which were audible in the rooms as well. I called down at 1 a.m. to ask that the music be turned off. The receptionist was extremely apologetic and turned it off right away - but I was told that they generally keep it on all night."
"3350",4,"We loved the pink hotel and will definitely be going back! It was clean, well furnished and the bed and bedding was heavenly!! Crisp white sheets with billowy comfort. The Hotel is right on the beautiful beach and the sunrise was spectacular! The Walkabout is like staying in your own private beach cabin. Stores and restaurants are walking distance. We... More"
"3351",4,"Bad: The facility is normal and so many people held parties at night, so you may not wanna stay there if you are seeking a place where is relaxing and quiet. Good: Staffs are friendly and the location is good"
"3352",5,"The rooms, service, location, staff, and breakfasts were perfect. And the pool was unbelievably enticing despite its (or maybe because of its) unusual location!"
"3353",3,"This hotel is perfect for a short stay. It's really close to the interstate, they have a pool, there's ample parking and eateries close by (you could walk) to get a quick bite to eat. They offer breakfast in the lobby from 6am-9am, however, I was not able to take advantage. They offer free wifi, but found it a bit... More"
"3354",5,"Great looking and clean and friendly! Good value for the money and a nice part of town, too! Easy off and on the highway nearby. Lots of good places to eat very close by. Stayed nearby once before and glad we tried something different this time."
"3355",5,"We do a lot of business traveling and have stayed in hotels with kitchenettes that have nothing to cook with and frankly, we don't travel with pots and pans! This Mainstay was fully equipped with everything needed right down to paper towels! The desk clerk was extremely friendly and helpful as was the employee in the breakfast area. The room... More"
"3356",2,"I thought this would be a cute, quaint, retro motel but it turned out to be closer to Bates Motel than a Blue Sky experience. The carpet had stains, the pool was broken, there were dogs barking in one of the rooms and there were ants crawling in the bathroom sink. Won't be back."
"3357",5,"I was in town for a trade show next door at the convention center. Very nice stay. Extremely comfortable bed. Excellent staff. has nice Papasito's on first floor. You can't ask for a better place to stay."
"3358",5,"As previously mentioned in other reviews, check-in is across the street on the 2nd floor, so I was prepared for that. Got a basic 2 bedroom oceanfront on the 4th floor. Room was nice. Full size fridge, stove, microwave, all the basics. Kitchen had plates, silverware, cups, other utensils and appliances, everything you needed. Basic bathroom with a hair dryer.... More"
"3359",5,"What a wonderful surprise this hotel was to us!! We were greeted by the front desk and treated like royalty. Although we had to wait a half hour til our room was ready, they made sure we were comfortable and gave us bottled water. The room was GREAT. A huge bathtub was a delight. I don't normally take a bath... More"
"3360",5,"Nice room with privacy barrier when traveling with children. Larger room than normal with separate bathing from vanity. Comfortable beds with freshly cleaned spreads! Free breakfast in the morning. Unfortunately, 19 parking. ( The only drawback.)"
"3361",5,"Bad: The only thing I wish there could have been is hot food choices for breakfast, such as eggs and bacon or sausage. I did like how they set up the breakfast on each floor. That was very nice, however, having a place to eat outside of our room would be nice. But knowing there isn't anywhere to do that I think you do an excellent job with everything. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you. Good: The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very clean and updated. We stayed in the deluxe king room. Staff were all very nice and helpful!"
"3362",5,"Two families shared a two bedroom two bathroom condo and didn't feel crowded at all. Plenty of space in the living and dining area, with extra space on the balcony too. The kids loved the swimming pool with slide, and we had a nice lunch by the pool, and dinner at the Dukes. Lovely holiday resort! Only slight downside was... More"
"3363",5,"This Hampton Inn location was easily accessible and well kept. We enjoyed our nice comfortable rooms. The bathrooms were clean and the room as well as the hotel had a nice clean smell that reassured cleanliness. We would definitely consider staying at this property again."
"3364",2,"Paying full price while hotel is under construction is not acceptable...newly renovated room was mediocre at best...room only had one chair...no lounge chair ...previously provided when staying there...furniture was cheaply built and made...cleanliness of room was at best just acceptable...found things left behind by former guests...dirty floor...bed was comfortable however...breakfast was just OK...nothing to rave about and certainly not a selling point for me to stay there...staff was very friendly and informative however...would hesitate to stay there again...very disappointing for sure..."
"3365",5,"Bad: A fridge in the room would be super nice. Good: The room was very clean, beds comfy and 3 pillows. Every one was friendly. Great valet staff."
"3366",5,"Beds not very comfortable, and the price was quite steep (even realizing it was Labor Day weekend and many Inns raise their rates) otherwise: very clean, well-appointed, convenient to many dining places and lake activities."
"3367",3,"Bad: I was in room 314, and its very noisy at night with the street ambiance, so dont expect to sleep before 2AM. I had to take my breakfast to adjacent hotels as continental / seated proper breakfast was not available (or couldnt find it...). Good: The bed was confortable and the location is just amazing on Fremont street."
"3368",5,"This was an unexpected surprise! We usually stay on Canal or with friends but this will change that in the future. Loved the hardwood floors and quaint atmosphere. There were no kids running around and it is less than 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street. Continental breakfast, coffee ALL DAY, and really good cafes nearby, open 24 hours or at least late night. Parking lot is secured at night, cameras monitoring as well. Also right across from trolley stop (so convenient-did not have to move the car)!! Wi-fi included"
"3369",4,"Pros: - Fair Price - Free Wifi (Strong enough to make a voice call on) - Breakfast, Sandwiches, and Beer downstairs - Proximity to Snowshoe - Satellite TV - Comfortable Bed - Nice View Cons: - Could be a bit cleaner (mainly dusting), but no big complaints Came up for a ski weekend. Was able to make a relatively last... More"

"3372",5,"This was an excellent hotel to visit! The customer service was some of the best I've received, and I travel all year. I will be staying here every time I return to the Charlotte area. Despite the busy weekend, this hotel still felt like my home away from home."
"3373",5,"Just stayed at The Mills House with 3 girlfriends, it was wonderful. It is a beautiful hotel and close to the historic district. Didn't want to leave! Couldn't have been more perfect."
"3374",5,"Great staff and accommodations for our family with young kids. The evening snack hour (food and drinks ) was perfect to complement our time in Dayton. Pool was fun for the kids, even in December. Recommended"
"3375",2,"BW has an annex! It's on the far side of the street. We had a roach and a broken air conditioner the first day. Had to repack and move to another room! On the third day in 103 degrees the elevator broke. We're 75 and our new room was on the third floor! All outside surfaces are covered w tar rather than repaving. It's pealing and looks very shabby. Only four umbrellas at the outdoor pool for over 100 guests! We had stayed in the main bldg. before, and were very disappointed to be across the street."
"3376",3,"Recently spent two nights at this hotel. Location is convenient to subway. Short walk to Penn Station. Many restaurants in the area. Not many amenities here. Everything seems well worn but clean. Staff pleasant and helpful. Not inexpensive."
"3377",4,"Relaxing stress free."
"3378",5,"Nice suite with 2 bedrooms fold out couch- was great to have 3 separate places to sleep, for 3 guys in town for LA Angels vs Red Sox baseball game..

"3379",5,"Great, friendly service. Close to beach and great restaurants and art galleries. Comfortable room. We had a great time."
"3380",4,"I was highly satisfied with my accommodations. The room was most comfortable and spacious. Very easy to locate and access. Staff were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Everything I could have needed was available for meal preparation. The bed and pillows were of very high quality. I enjoyed my stay very much. I would recommend this facility without hesitation."
"3381",2,"In addition to having to ask to be moved three times after seeing the initial condition of the room I was assigned (something I have never done in nearly 100 hotels I have stayed at), they carpet was so dirty I refused to take off my socks, the nightstand had a sticky substance on the surface and in the drawers, the furniture was old, worn and dirty, the staff was not terribly helpful and the neighborhood is in an economically depressed area and I did not feel completely safe at night being a single woman travelling alone. There are multiple signs in the parking lot warning that the hotel is not responsible for any damage or theft and I was worried about my car being broken into. Only pros- just off the highway and one of the nicest hotel gyms I've ever seen. Even so, I will NEVER stay here again! If I hadn't already paid in advance through hotels.com, I would have left immediately."
"3382",5,"We stayed at the Golden West last summer, and returned again for our son's OIT orientation day.

"3385",5,"Good: Nice breakfast with 5 bottomless mimosas. Very nice and helpful staff. Loved the option to forego room service and get a 5 voucher for use at the hotel.

"3388",4,"I stay in a lot of Motel 6s and have been satisfied with just about all of them I've tried. This one is a notch above the typical Motel 6. The location is great -- I walked to World of Coca-Cola and some good restaurants -- and the free parking helps make it a real bargain. The place is clean and well maintained and t staff was pleasant and helpful. I walked both day and night and never felt in danger though I did have to deal with a couple of panhandlers. No surprise there."
"3389",4,"Arrived late. Room was clean, very nice linens, good Wi-Fi connection. Left early the next day and six hours later, discovered I left a vest there. I called the hotel and spoke to Nash. He contacted housekeeping and found it. Shipped it out to my next destination. Excellent service!"
"3390",3,"First on all Sam the shuttle driver was great!!!!! I can not say enough about him. To get to the hotel, you must call for the shuttle to guarantee they will arrive at their schedule times or take a taxi which should cost you 5. We were burned upon arrival with a 10 fee while he stayed on his mobile phone. Turns out the hotel is a quick 3 to 4 minute ride. The hotel is definitely too far to walk and neighborhood between metro and hotel is a bit sketchy with the apartments but the hotel is in a descant and quiet area. The check in staff did not seem too friendly nor helpful when asked about surrounding area. Once we got to know Sam, everything became better. He made sure we got got to metro station which is very convenient on time and inquired when we would return. He was there waiting!!!! Hotel is doing some remodeling but does not effect your stay. Thanks again Sam!!!!!"

"3396",4,"Nice hotel with an excellent location. Large, modern rooms. Nice facilities and great internet connection.

"3410",5,"The Aloft hotel is in an excellent location, it is right next to city hall and the market and walking distance to so many other shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is extremely clean as was the hotel room. The room was on the smaller side, but if you're like me and my husband, you're not there to spend all your time in the room. It was plenty of space for the two of us. The bar downstairs is nice, we each enjoyed a cocktail there one of the nights. The only negative I would say is the expensive valet parking, however we went one block north on broad st and found parking for 15 dollars a day. Overall a great stay and highly recommended.

I look forward to welcoming you back the next time you visit our fine city!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager"
"3411",5,"Very nice place to stay when in Asheboro. Staff is super friendly. Rooms are what you would expect for a Fairfield and clean. Free breakfast is actually quite nice with plenty of options. I would certainly recommend this hotel to business travelers."
"3412",2,"The ceiling was dripping water onto my broken toilet. The place is in desperate need of renovations. It was clean as it could be for the condition it was in."
"3413",4,"Bad: No frig."
"3414",5,"The Good: This Hampton Inn really stood out from the other Hampton Inns I've stayed at in recent weeks. The bed and room was really clean, well maintained, and very comfortable. The staff was really friendly and helpful. And the breakfast was better than usual every morning. Not sure what is different in the ingredients at some Hampton Inns. Even... More"
"3415",5,"The Saint Hotel is a top notch hotel located only half a block from the action of Duval St. From the check-in experience, to the amazing upgraded room overlooking the beautiful infinite pool and the convenience of the prime location in Key West this place was awesome. Upon check-in I was helped to my room by the amazingly helpful and friendly staff and I was directed to some places I should check out for the nightlife all within walking distance. The next 2 days, I started my mornings with the complimentary continental breakfast followed by exploring the island of Key West on 1 of the complimentary hotel bikes. I was able to end my afternoons with some relaxation in the amazing pool area. The entire staff was extremely helpful and professional throughout my stay. It was great to see the manager Abraham was very active with the everyday workings of the hotel staff and guests to ensure everyone has a great, unforgettable experience at the Saint. I would without a doubt stay at The Saint on my next trip to Key West!!Miss Elissa, Very Nice, you told me you were going to write a review, but I didn't expect all this, your writing has definitely spread smiles throughout the employees. Thank You, the whole staff thanks you. We are delighted you chose The Saint Hotel during your stay in Key West, you were a fun guest, easy to talk to and a delightful ray of sunshine around the property. Should your future travels bring you back to Key West, we hope The Saint Hotel will be your preference out of the many hotels to choose. Once again Thank You for the wonderful review."
"3416",3,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. It's better than the reviews depict. We really appreciated Gary and all of his advice regarding the hotel and the city! ***just prepare to pay for parking. We weren't expecting this.. Roughly 27 per day"
"3417",5,"All employees were very helpful and polite"
"3418",1,"Stayed there for a few days while working in Orangeburg, SC. The place is a dump. No mini fridge, microwave, half the lights didn't work, roach sighting at least a few times a day, etc., the list can go on and on.

"3419",3,"Having just returned from a week long vacation at the Honua Kai I am torn at what to say. The service was great, everyone person we encountered was very polite and very helpful and courteous. The rooms, lobby and gardens are very very clean and really beautiful. We had a Studio Ocean View and a 2 Bedroom Resort View. The... More"
"3420",4,"Old hotel with many remaining architectural charms and most modern amenities. The staff is exceptional: friendly and very accommodating. Has a little bit of the wear tear around the edges associated with an historic building but remarkably clean. Passed the allergy test."
"3421",4,"We had great time"
"3422",5,"This is a very nice place. Rooms were decorated nicely, roomy, and cool! I loved the seating area by the pool, but it does get a bit loud with all of the kids. Would have like an outdoor seating area away from the pool/kids. Wifi was fast, breakfast was good, and there were lots of green spaces for our dogs.... More"
"3423",5,"We were blown away at the dcor and style of this Courtyard Marriott! We were finishing our vacation week which was split between Myrtle and Charleston SC and we had just been very disappointed by our stay in Charleston at the Hyatt Place. This was just what we needed to turn things around! We were going to a show at the House of Blues and it was perfect, just down the street! Plenty of gas, mini golf, food, bars, shopping etc nearby! We arrived early and they did not have rooms ready so they gave us free waters and snacks and although we maybe waited 30 mins for a room they kept checking on us as well as still got us into a room before the posted check in time on 4th of July weekend! I would highly recommend this hotel!!"
"3424",4,"We had a wonderful stay here. It was very clean and the staff was super friendly. We had some minor housing/maintenance issues but over all it was well worth the price. I think we ran to wal-mart at least 10 times. Lots of stores and eateries in the area. I will stay again."
"3425",4,"The resort is located on the sunny side of the island, with calmer waves. Centrally located to travel to many site-seeing spots on the island. Large and family friendly. One water slide, nice. Large ocean front to sit and relax and is away from the bustle of the pools so peaceful. Most rooms have a decent view of the ocean... More"
"3426",5,"This hotel was awesome the rooms were great the staff was awesome the location was perfect the only draw back to this hotel is the 40 for valet parking however there are other cheaper options close to the hotel the roof top bar was really cool the breakfast was excellent overall the hotel gets a 97 out of 100 score from meThank you so much for taking the time to share this great review of your stay and we are delighted to know how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. There are cheaper options of parking around the area which is due to them having less labor and security costs than ours but yes they are conveniently located should guests decide to utilize those options. Your business and feedback are very important to us and we look forward to having you stay with us again whenever your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,"
"3427",4,"Alright place, they are renovating rooms as they get empty. The place is kinda dated, but and kept-up. They are right off interstate at exit 15. Denny's is right next door and other restaurants are close"
"3428",5,"This is a great hotel for families. The rooms can accommodate six people comfortably and have a lot of extra space. The staff were friendly and saw to every need. They accidentally checked us into a room that should have been off market and immediately changed the room for us. It happens and they were very apologetic and gave us... More"
"3429",5,"I have stayed a number of Best Westerns over the last 30 years in Canada the USA and this one at Wapakoneta, OHIO rates right up there with the best of them. Was easily accessible off the interstate. Very clean room and kitchen area. Staff were very friendly professional."
"3430",5,"Bad: everything was great besides the bar lounge on the top floor. It could use some renovations. Good: Bed was extremely comfortable!"
"3431",3,"Short trip, hotel tired, staff indifferent"
"3432",3,"the breakfast at 17 bucks was a bit of disgrace. it is a particular building."
"3433",5,"Employees were great and rooms were really nice. Safe area."
"3434",2,"Fantastic location but for 200/night, I would have expected a larger room. My room was smaller than any hotel I've stayed at in NY, London or Hong Kong where rooms are notoriously small. There are many, many better options near the Mag Mile and in River North so look elsewhere."
"3435",3,"I always stay here when in Marietta, but never again. Different pillows this time. Barely slept at all. Won't be back."
"3436",5,"The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan"
"3437",5,"Intuitive and Friendly staff. Hotel was clean and well managed. Early check in was made available and each item on my profile was provided upon entering my room. The continental breakfasts were amazing!"
"3438",5,"This was a very nice experience. The food and service were excellent! The owners are extremely nice and helpful. The kids loved the play areas and the recreation center. 1st time visit and we will be back and next time we will try the float trip!"

"3441",3,"This is my second stay at this hotel. My room was quiet and clean. I was a little concerned as it looked like there wer a few more lomg-term renters than before. The front desk in the evening was friendly. In the morning not as helpful. But for the price it was a good stay. But next time, I'll probably... More"
"3442",5,"To date, this takes the prize.

"3444",4,"Stay in Howard Johnson Inn is a good deal I can find over the Internet around University of Delaware -- Newark area. However, (1) the breakfirst is too simple, not good. (2) One night there was no hot water. (3) Another night there was no Internet connection. (4) they charge early check-in for some $40, that is not friendly. I hope the boss of the hotel can improve their service further and provide kind service. But I thank Hotels.com rewards me a night stay for free."
"3445",4,"The hotel is exactly what it needs to be for Port Aransas-- conveniently located (10 minutes walk from the beach), affordable (we booked a large room with a mini fridge, king size bed etc for 39 per night during the off season), and the owners are attentive, informative and incredibly friendly.

"3457",4,"I had a great sleep. Great location, near Disney. Plenty of restaurants near by. The outlets and any other shopping were minutes away. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was ok. Wish it had more breakfast options for a diabetic, but overall a surprising and wonderful stay."

Pool was clean and had a nice view with a breeze. Will definitely be back!! I've stayed in many hotels in New Orleans. This one is my favorite."

"3472",3,"While the place is certainly interestingly decorated, and very quiet during the off season, there are very few amenities, at least of the sort we were interested in. No pool, no hot tub, no gym, but you can get a bucket of mid-level wine sitting on your bed when you arrive. Second floor has nice balconies overlooking the water."

"3481",5,"Great hotel. Clean and comfortable with a very good breakfast."
"3482",2,"The hotel is listed as 'ocean front' but there 2 buildings. The second building is across the street from the ocean. That wouldn't be so bad but our room faced out on the old rusting parking structure. You could touch the rusting girders from our door. It was very unpleasant - I wouldn't stay here again. Not at all the standard I would expect from Best Western."
"3483",4,"Avery comfortable bed, a desk fr laptop set up, and a fridge and microwave made the somewhat extended stay very pleasant and relaxing. Breakfast allowed guests to fuel up before a busy day."

Laminate floor needs cleaning, it was scuff marked and had nail polish drops on it. Breakfast bad, dried out biscuits ,no jam or peanut butter for toast, no yogurt."

"3489",3,"The room was clean but the refrigerator was very loud so loud that it woke us up. When I contacted the staff, they came to the room but since I had out , so left a note to get contact them. My expectation was they would take care of this issue while I was out of the room. Since this did not happen, at 1:30 am, I just unplugged the refrigerator so we could all sleep."
"3490",3,"The overall building is clean but showing some signs of wear...The front desk staff are very friendly, polite and helpful. Its in a safe area and there is a nice big mall a block down the street. There is a free shuttle that brings you right to the Springfield metro subway station. The breakfast spot next door is not an award winner, but hey it's included so don't complain. The only thing we didn't like is that some families hung out in the halls late at night chit chatting loudly. I guess it was our misfortune that night and the other thing was that the cleaning staff started vacuuming the halls like at 7 am in the morning and it wakes you up...other than that its okay for a short stay."

"3497",3,"The 1st night we checked in was the night the crazy storm hit DC. We ended up losing power that night (Fri) and it still hadn't returned as of Mon. While this was by not their fault, it made the stay quite dreadful. We had a busy day on Sat, as we were looking for houses (we're moving to DC) and didn't get back to the hotel until late the hotels with power were sold out. The room was disgusting, so we slept in the car and checked out on Sunday. Apparently, that was a mistake. The girl at the front desk said it shouldn't be a problem to get reimbursed for that night and the pre-paid nights we didn't stay. However, we were told to call the manager, who said that it is not customary for them to refund us for a night in which our things were in the hotel, even though it was miserable and we couldn't sleep there (I should mention that there was record-breaking heat). Ultimately, she refunded us for this night and we were satisfied. Had the power not been an issue, the hotel was pretty nice. The rooms seemed clean and were recently renovated. The staff was really nice too (even though they were hot tired). The location is pretty decent. They are currently working on the orange line though, so it's closed on the weekends at New Carrollton. Fortunately, the Greenbelt stop is about a 10 min drive away and there's free parking on the weekends. Ultimately, I think we just had bad luck and our stay would have been perfectly fine if the power hadn't gone out on day one."

Room was nicely furnished with all the amenities. Breakfast and manager's special was the right touch with the right level of support too. Entire hotel is very warm to include common areas as well. Exercise room has everything to get in a workout and the pool and hot tub is a great treat too. The papers, especially the WSJ is a great complimentary item. Loved all of it and will certainly be back. Being from Hawaii, this stay was very nice and very warm !! Travel to Maryland often and first time staying here, but not the last."
"3504",4,"For a very quick trip to Disneyland we stayed at the Townplace Suites. The lobby and rooms are small but well organized and clean. The free breakfast was a hit but the small lobby can get crowded early in the morning as everyone heads out to Disneyland. Easy shuttle service from the hotel directly to Disneyland. There is a pool but we were too tired to take advantage of it! Good selection of family freindly restaurant and entertainment options right next to the hotel so all around a very good choice.Thank you so much for staying with us. I am glad that your family enjoyed your time here with us. Maybe next time you can take advantage of our pool area the next time your in the Anaheim area. We look forward to your next arrival."

We stay at HomeWood Suites for 2-3 months every year visiting grandchildren and relatives, accumulating enough points to stay free at any of there Hotels between Florida, Illinois Wisconsin. Saves us a lot of Money, we like that :-)"
"3513",3,"The hotel had a convenient location, right outside of the interstate and 5 minutes from the metro station. The front desk people were okay but it seems like they are always in a hurry - from checking in, checking out or even just asking a question. The breakfast was great, it was a hot breakfast not just bagels and hotcakes. We had eggs, grits, sausages and such. The cleaning ladies were awesome! Every time we got back to the hotel after lunch, our room was already made and our towels changed. The shuttle driver, Sam, was awesome too! He made the drive to the metro very fun and was very helpful. Again, if not for the front desk people, this hotel would be great!"
"3514",5,"This hotel was cheaper than the other near-BWI hotels that were available when I needed one. Yet, a bit to my surprise, it was a really nice place. The only small negative is there is only one computer and printer for printing boarding passes."
"3515",5,"Rooms are spacious, clean, and staff are excellent. The ONE thing that stood out (unfortunately), was the coffee. I am a coffee drinker. I've had too many brands to count. The coffee used at this hotel is absolutely the worst I have ever had. It has a terrible after-taste, something like 1-part coffee and 1-part dirt from the parking lot.... More"

"3528",5,"The stay was great! Only complaint (not really) was we were too close to King Street where my wife spent a lot of money. Location was very convenient to all the sights and restaurants we targeted. Hotel staff was very helpful in explaining the best way to arrange our trip to Ft. Sumter."

"3534",3,"Overall experience OK. Hotel had remodel several years ago. Our room's ceiling had only been painted half way. Wallpaper in bathroom was coming lose in several spots. Tile around tub was losing caulk. Breakfast buffet was limited."
"3535",5,"It was wonderful."
"3536",2,"Although the hotel was close to MDW, the hotel was pretty old. The carpet in our room was pretty bad, it was sticky and needed immediate replacement. The furniture had seen better days. I didn't think it was worth the money we paid. The hotel certainly needs TLC in many areas to keep it competitive. They were charging 8.50 for breakfast. They could have included that in the price we paid for the room. That is not a big deal but the carpet is. The noise level was also high as it is right next to the main thoroughfare."
"3537",5,"My husband and I decided to go down to Hampton for a weekend over Valentines Day. We had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. They were all very friendly and we got in real late on our first night and the check in process was smooth and stil friendly at 1:00am. I was glad to know that I was receiving the same service at 1:00am checking in as I would have during a normal check in hour. The room was so comfortable and clean. We loved our stay and it was close to all the near by attractions."

"3539",4,"They have a nice breakfast buffet, with waffles, eggs, sausage, bagels, cold cereal, fruit. Shortly after I had checked out and left the premises, I realized I had left my Kindle behind. They were very helpful about letting me into the room to retrieve it."
"3540",1,"What a terrible experience. I reserved and prepaid through Hotels.com. I arrived close to midnight because of flight delays and was informed that the hotel was overbooked and that they had moved me to a hotel in Alexandria - 20 minutes away. I received no phone call, email or contact either from the Hotel or Hotels.com. The hotel they moved me too was in no way an equivalent hotel (half the price and they wouldn't refund me the difference which required me to through a fairly efficient but inconvenient process to call Hotels.com and request a refund), incredibly inconvenient and they also made me pay for a second cab to get there. I would not recommend unless there was absolutely no alternative. The night manager was at least friendly and sympathetic but powerless to do anything."

"3546",2,"I wish tripadvisor had 1/2 stars for our use because I would have given this a 2 1/2...3 is too high. This was our first hotel of 8 different ones on our Napa/Pacific Coast vacation, so I have a lot to compare it to. I have many other reviews on this site and I try to be fair when reviewing any property we've sayed at.Having said that.....It was my first experience at a Best Western brand and if this is a plus property I would not want to stay at a non-plus one.I disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviews...this is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area. Who are you comparing yourself with When comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range. You are priced as high as other properties but those properties have better/more amenities or are closer to vineyards, therefore it's not a fair comparison. It's like comparing apples and oranges...both fruits but there are many different qualities. Now back to the property....Don't expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name. This is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants. If that's what you're looking for, great book it, just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polution.Cons....The pool's capacity is 8 people. That should tell you something about the size. I'd guess it's 8X10' (that's probably a generous estimate). In my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial. The balcony we had was so closed in and dark. The solid front and sides don't allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs, not that the view was great....we looked out over Denny's roof and a traffic light. Oh, Dennys. sigh.....went our first 2 mornings. Ordered the free entree of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 bacon or sausage. Getting a hot entree I guess is impossible, the food was cold to the touch. My husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it. There were maybe 4 other parties in the restaurant at the time, not busy at all. The tea water was luke warm at best. Total waste of my time.Location...not your romantic getaway place by any means. About 20 to 25 minutes to the heart of Napa's wine country depending on traffic. In hinesight I would not have booked this hotel if not for the MANY( now suspicious in my mind)...reviews. I find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best. Really After spending 3 days in Napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries, I question the validity of these raving reviews.Pros....Yes there are a few...I promised a fair review and that's what I deliver.Shower....best shower head of any hotel. In fact I'm looking for one for my own shower.Cleanliness....our room was very clean. Small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet. Microwave, fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenience.Bed/pillows....very comfortable.So if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's a bit overpriced than book this hotel. If you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pool...don't book this property. At most I would expect to pay under 100 a night for this property based on it's location and lack of amenities. All the renovations in the world don't matter to me if they're not available when I'm there. They need to charge accordingly.We paid 537 for Saturday, Sunday and Monday evenings. I now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property. Oh well, live and learn.Thank you for your detailed review. First, we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property. Each hotel will have their pluses and minuses. We also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market. We actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its located 9 miles south of Napa, further away from the vineyards. On average you would have paid between 75 -200 more for your stay in a comparable hotel.All Best Westerns that have at least a 3 diamond recognition from AAA have the opportunity to be a PLUS property as long as they have a PIP( property Improvement Plan) in place. With the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete. There is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines. Our rates are similar to last years (before Plus) and we have added breakfast at Dennys and many more amenities. We never hide the fact that we have a small pool (12x 184). There are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other 3rd party sites. When a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool. We recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger pool.As for reviews, all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in Napa. We are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve. TripAdvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and ours.Thank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms, (we are an ultra clean property) our shower heads and beds. The shower heads are by Delta and Ive actually seen them at Home Depot. The bed that was in your room is a Cheshire IV pillow top by Serta. Thank you again for your review."

"3548",4,"Clean hotel, with exceptional staff. I would have given this hotel the highest rating, but unfortunately, they decided to put low flow shower heads in the rooms. My room, and other rooms, reported by friends who stayed here last weekend, all had the same complaint. They could barely rinse the shampoo out of their hair. It was that bad."
"3549",5,"Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable."
"3550",4,"Husband and I planned to stop in Blythe as a rest/sleep stop on the way back from sedona. Very clean and comfortable place to lay your head for a night. Bountiful free breakfast as well. The checkin/out process seems to need some work but it's a new hotel so that is to be expected."

"3554",2,"Very dissatisfied with the staff and the lack of caring about at least 5 different guest (that we know of) not being able to check in until after 5:00 pm because rooms weren't ready. It's a Holiday weekend you would think they would be staffed a little better. They are less than a mile away from a theme park and should no how busy they would be especially on a holiday."
"3555",4,"Bad: We came in the evening after a long business journey and I was pulling the luggage for me and my assistant in and there was no one to assist me , two people walked by and the third finally asked me if I needed help. I was not please. Then, I had booked a room with two beds and they sent me to a room with king size bed. I had to go back to front desk with my luggage. The front desk person was great she upgraded us to a suite on the executive floor and turned the situation around.

"3562",1,"I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Is this the type of name Marriott wants for itself Should I take my loyalty to a different brand Dear floydmcmillan2007,Good Day, Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of Towne place suites Anaheim, I am very sorry to learn that your experience with us during your visit was not up to your par .

"3564",5,"We loved this Hotel, great location, clean and staff very friendly and helpful. They even let my dog come for no extra charge! we would go back in a heartbeat, infact next year we are.."
"3565",4,"I've stayed at this hotel twice. Each time was only for one night, however, so I can't comment much on housekeeping other than to say my room was always clean and presentable upon each check in. This last time I did have an issue with the outlets on the desk next to the televison, so I had to make my tea by my nightstand with the provided coffee maker. It would also be a great convenience if they had a mini fridge and microwave in each room. But other than those minor issues, I can't complain and would return. The cookies are delicious as well."
"3566",3,"The price was that of a hotel but it was really more like a motel. The hotel was clean and quite. But the cost was the highest I've ever paid at a BW. I did not go to the pool so I'm not sure the quality of the pool. Pillows at a BW could always be better than they are."
"3567",2,"We made reservations well over a month prior. However, after a long drive a two tired kids we were informed at check in that they were out of double beds. I get they made a lot of $ from a large group but we paid too! Could not care less either. Lier would be one word to describe this service"

"3576",5,"Bad: Not really anything to do with the hotel but we were only in San Fran for a few days and found we spent a lot of time travelling down to the pier for Alcatraz, cycling across the bridge etc. Buses take a long time (so do taxis though) and although walkable (about an hour) if you've only got limited time in the City you might want to think about staying nearer to the Piers or Financial District.

"3591",3,"It was an intermediate stop on a long journey, so there was not much chance to enjoy the area or spend time in the room. The front desk staff was very accommodating."
"3592",4,"The Maritime hotel is very nice. The room was small but clean and well accommodating."
"3593",3,"The rooms need some updating. The bathroom was very small and the exhaust fan was very loud in the bathroom."
"3594",5,"Good: I'd go again. So relaxing. Aside from BALLEYS, it was a longer than desired walk to other attractions."

"3598",4,"The staff at this Microtel were wonderful, but the owners need to invest in new beds! Mattresses we're very soft and sagged in the middle. Breakfast was above average."
"3599",5,"After being on a 7 day cruise that left out of New Orleans, we decided to stay and explore the beautiful city of New Orleans. We were with a group of friends who were staying at the NOPSI Hotel, so we decided to book a room there too, and boy were we glad we did. This hotel is virtually brand new, opening in July 2017. The NOPSI Hotel building formerly served as the headquarters of the citys power and transportation company, New Orleans Public Service Inc. Its absolutely amazing how this hotel has been transformed into such a gorgeous and luxurious hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the bellmen, Bolton and Will. These gentlemen took great care of us and our belongings. What a great feeling to be welcomed so warmly the minute one arrives at a hotel! The rooms have the most comfortable mattresses, finest linens and all the amenities you could ever want, including robes. They bathroom is quite exquisite, with its grand two door entrance, marble countertops, double sink, and oversized shower.If so inclined, you can choose to indulge in an on sight spa service at the NOPSI Spa. There is an on sight restaurant, multiple bars, one in the grand atrium and one in the restaurant area. Be sure to check out Above the Grid, the rooftop pool and bar. Above the Grid is open to hotel guests and locals, providing everyone with an extraordinary view of the citys skyline. NOPSI Hotel is about a 1 mile from Bourbon Street. Its situated in a perfect location, walking distance from virtually all local attractions. We walked back and forth to Bourbon Street many times during our short stay. On sight parking is available for a fee. You should contact the hotel directly for daily rate charges. Pinot, Thank you for sharing your NOPSI Hotel experience. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. It has been exciting for us to finally share NOPSI with our guests. Whether you are dining at one our restaurants or relaxing in one of our well-appointed rooms, we are here to make your stay memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"

"3604",4,"Great location (downtown, access to bus and Metro, shops, restaurants), Very good and friendly service, general comfort, I did benefit from a special price offer due to low attendance i guess.A few little things to be improved to me are the waiting time (up or down) at the elevator - one elevator only for the upper floors - Insulation in the room (Air, street noise) could be better too. But overall a good experience."

"3631",3,"Bad: In my opinion, the carpet needs to be replaced or cleaned urgently. It left an unpleasant musty smell in the room. I changed the room and the smell remained. After walking barefoot on the carpet and stepping into the tub, there were black dirt tracks in the tub. I expected the rooms to be as good as the standard of the lobby, the dining area and the pool area. Good: Excellent breakfast. The outside facilities, lobby and the pool area are very good."
"3632",5,"We are Choice Hotel platinum members, and we've discovered that many of the Comfort Suite properties are comparable in price to the original hotel rooms, but larger and with more amenities.

Our service level is something we pride ourselves on and glad it showed during your trip. We hope to see you next time in town!"
"3642",4,"For the location and price this place is a diamond in the rough. It was clean, had all the amenites one would like. But do not expect any service from the staff. The hispancis who cleaned up were the most friendly, they did speak each morning. There was a buffet breakfast that was offered (for a price), we were not even told about it. My daughter found it while exploring the hotel. They run two shuttles to the metro station, neither one would detour out of their way to drop us off at Arlington National Cememtary for a funeral. As I said before the property is well keep, clean, nice and for the location and price a deal. But do not expect southern hosptality or anyone to go out of their way to do anything special for you."

On the day we arrived we tried to call again and they finally answered the phone we told them our problems with the hotel and they yelled to late to cancel and hung up on us . They are now charging our credit card UGH you should take them off your site deplorable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"3649",4,"The room was clean and in good condition. Would stay there again. The free breakfast was mostly good except for the biscuits that got staler every day. Made me wonder how often they made the biscuits. Friday they were good, by Monday they were very very stale. The scrambled eggs were good on Friday through Sunday. Monday They tasted different and weren't as good. I ended up having to throw mine away and eating a muffin instead."

"3656",4,"We only had two days to spend in Baltimore so I chose this hotel based on it's location. It was even better than I anticipated. Walking distance to Fell's Point. The room was spacious and well appointed. It was loud in the morning with breakfast in the lobby and housekeeping starts knocking at 8am sharp. They'll keep knocking too which was irritating so if you want to sleep past 8 put the privacy card on your door handle. Breakfast ends at 10 which I wasn't told at check-in and didn't see in writing anywhere so we missed that the first day. We were there for crabby hour and it was delicious and a nice touch to the stay! I saw other reviews complaining about parking, we didn't have an issue. There's a lot and a ramp right next door."

"3660",4,"Bad: rooms were in need of updating especially the bathrooms. Toilet was leaky and loud, the TV was dated, and there were updates being performed at the time of stay. Other than than it was worth the money. Good: The proximity was great because it was easy to access and close enough to the strip. They have a great sandwich shop at the shell station on the corner open until 2 am which is a bonus and saved us a ton of on food. Also a little hole in the wall casino bar where you can get a beer and all beef hot dog for 3, shots for 4 just down the street."

"3694",4,"The price was good for this stay, only stayed one night, little scary neighborhood."
"3695",3,"The hotel stay was great. Stayed for a conference located at the hotel which was great as well. The only complaint I have is the parking. You can park in their parking garage connected to the hotel for a $16 charge, which is a little ridiculous. The hotel was good at compensating me for this as I was uninformed and unaware, but the third party company that rubs the toll through the garage was absolutely horrid!!! I was I could give negative reviews on them alone they one young lady in particular made my great weekend end in absolute anger while leaving. Tried to charge me almost $40 in charges for parking with the receipt from the hotel, staying that they had covered it for me."
"3696",4,"Although my hotel rooms was great and the location was great there were a few things that will cause me not to return. The PARKING which they charged me 16 a day was horrible. The spots are so small that compact cars barely fit much less an intermediate or an ever so popular SUVs. Everyone went over the line making it impossible to find a spot and if you were lucky enough to find a spot and get into it, you couldn't get out of your car, most of the time it took me 15-30 minutes to park just because of the lot. The other thing I didn't like was no help with bags. They provided you with carts, but then there were stairs you had put your things in a dummy elevator and send them up or down and being an older person the maneuvering of the cart itself was cumbersome."
"3697",4,"Nice hotel, terrible area. Loud traffic. Would not stay there again."
"3698",5,"From booking reservations out of state to check in to breakfast, the reception we experienced by the staff was heart warming and genuine. Hampton Inn went beyond any expectations we had during our stay."
"3699",5,"Our stay at The Restoration exceeded our expectations. The employees were friendly and eager to meet our every need. Lots of perks. Rooftop restaurant, swimming pool, extraordinary breakfast, and spacious suites. Thanks for making our stay luxurious!"
"3700",4,"This is the second time that we've stayed in this hotel. The rooms are clean, check in/ check out was a breeze the continental breakfast wasn't bad either. I like that the hotel is secluded but the mall restaurants are less than 5 minutes away. Pretty good for a last minute find. Darn those airplanes though..... :-)"
"3701",5,"We had the best service from a best western I have EVER had. ALL employees were so nice and helpful. We were even able to do laundry here. Score us. We were traveling the New England states and just needed to do some laundry to continue with the trip. The prices were reasonable for laundry and they have soap and... More"
"3702",4,"Check in was quick, efficient. Room was large, well appointed, kitchen area, separte bedroom. Free self parking Only down side was bedroom TV did not work and set up two wake up calls that never happened."

"3704",2,"My daughter and I were in Lafayette for a soccer tournament and this is where the team was set up to stay. We booked the room for a reasonable rate and I assumed there would be some due diligence as to the hotel and its conditions. After some research we found that the hotel was undergoing renovations. We requested to... More"
"3705",5,"We stayed in a two bedroom apartment during our stay in Anaheim in June 2004. We have two young children (3 and 5). The apartment was clean and well equipped. The beds were comfy and the linen fresh. We loved the location, near Dennys, Starbucks, Panda Express and Mc Donalds. We made our booking on the net from Australia and found our requests had been answered perfectly. ( A corner non-smoking room). Another great feature was the free parking and free shuttle to Disneyland. There were three T.V.'s all having cable, which the kids loved. There was a bath, lots of towels. I highly recommend this hotel to families with young children, we were very impressed."
"3706",5,"The Honua Kai Resort and Spa was the best place for our family to enjoy all that Maui has to offer. Our two bedroom unit came with a great living room, balcony with an ocean view, full kitchen to feed a family of 5, and access to pools, beach and Dukes restraurant. The room and service was great and the... More"
"3707",5,"Might have stayed in a BW a handful of times over the years. It was just never a chain that I ever felt any loyalty to.

"3710",4,"Too expensive for what offered Location and staff"
"3711",5,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. This was our second trip to Chicago, but our first at The River Hotel. The room was small, but the dcor and the view made up for it. The staff was very friendly, not a single person passed us without saying hello and asking us how we were. The concierge desk was fantastic! Tim was amazing, his recommendations were spot on, he helped us with directions, whether it was taking the train, a bus or walking. It was refreshing to have the help when you are travelling. Roman was also very helpful. We will definitely be staying here again."
"3712",5,"WE had an outstanding time enjoying the beauty of this resort and all the activities. Our rooms were furnished with interesting and New Hampshire like settings. The staff was very accommodating and we enjoyed the welcome wine reception."
"3713",2,"Bad: The place was falling apart, the tub was cracked and broken. the bathroom shelf was barely holding on. The bed was extremely tough to sleep on. Good: I liked that it was close to entertainment. The shower held a hot water temperature for a long time."
"3714",5,"We spent several days here as a rest stop on a long bicycle tour. The person at the desk was very helpful. We were checked in well before the standard check-in time.

"3717",3,"Good for its purpose which was to stay there only long enough to sleep. Fan in room was so loud that we had to shut the air off for the night. Lots of road noise. The breakfast was good with lots of options and great service by the folks managing it."
"3718",5,"Stayed here on my way to Canada from Phoenix. Check in was smooth and front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.

"3719",4,"Good stay"
"3720",4,"I stayed one night at this beautiful building in Back Bay. Unfortunately, my particular room had a very uncomfortable bed that was not level. I believe the problem was the mattress itself just being old, not the bed frame. I had to put a book between the mattress and the box spring to level it a bit. Additionally, the room was extremely hot, owing to the radiator being left on while the room was empty. I recommend that the hotel consider keeping the heat off between guests. Otherwise, the facility was great. The public areas are beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful."
"3721",4,"Stopped in St. Ignace to stay the night on our way up north. All they had left was a Jacuzzi room, and it was quite nice. It was heart shaped and they way it was set up, we could each sit comfortably next to each other and watch television. The bed was not the most comfortable but I was not... More"
"3722",5,"Good: Fun location, very nice hotel. Especially liked the simple breakfast."
"3723",4,"If you're simply looking for a place to stay for a night or two, this place fits the bill. It would probably serve the purpose for a lengthier stay if you're fishing with a bunch of buddies. It's not fancy, by any means, but it's perfectly acceptable.

"3725",5,"Aria was an outstanding resort. Very nice accommodations. Great location. Easy access to parking. Wifi works great. Bedding very comfortable. Only complaint was no access to use of a mini refrigerator and onsite dining very expensive. Many other dining options close."
"3726",5,"The room was clean. The staff was kind. There was a complimentary hot breakfast that included waffles and scrambled eggs, coffee and yogurt. The hotel is located next to a shopping mall and is not far from restaurants. My daughter enjoyed swimming in the pool. I would stay here again."
"3727",5,"Staff was we'll familiar with area and points of interest. Me and my significant other travel often and are very picky with were we stay. We couldn't have picked a more comfortable place. Breakfast had a nice spread, and the staff made sure everything was just right."
"3728",5,"A hidden gem, where a family can bypass all the fake fluff that you have to Tip to receive. Instead, you get a lovely spacious family room with all the necessities, for a fabulous stay. I highly recommend staying here. You will Thank Me."

"3730",1,"Lets see...where to begin. Perhaps it was the dust storm created on a windy day by the unpaved lot next door that created a scene from the Grapes of Wrath as the Joads outran a duststorm that literally almost obliterated the hotel.

"3732",2,"The hotel is crazy outdated with comforters literally dating back to the 1960's (and haven't been washed since). The first room that we checked into had spots of blood on the shower curtain, one wall, and ceiling fan, and a pubic hair perfectly placed on the bathroom towels. I asked the man at the front desk to come with me... More"
"3733",5,"Overall great experience! The staff was excellent! I have never encountered such a friendly staff before my stay here! My only complaint would be the need for some updating in the showers....BUT other than that I absolutely would recommend to everyone!"
"3734",5,"Aria Rocks!!! They have a Javier's in this hotel. This facility is a gem. Trendy, fun and the staff is amazing. You literally do not need to leave this resort. Thanks Aria we will be back soon. The M club was fun as well racking up our points."
"3735",5,"Bad: We had a ground unit and was unable to sleep until 11 pm every night because of the family above us had a kid that ran from 7 am to 11 pm for 3 nights. Suggestion: Put families with small kids on ground unit and that way we will all be comfort. Also requested early check in and wasnt assigned unit until 5 pm."
"3736",4,"I was satisfied for choosing Best Western. I try to always choose a Best Western because of there cost/ benefits of stay comparison. I feel that I get what I pay for and it is reasonable. I didn't expect a pool, so that was a surprise that I was grateful for, as well as my son."
"3737",5,"comfortable, clean and affordable"
"3738",5,"We traveled there over our Spring Break to get away and relax. This was our second visit and it was even better than before. The hospitality was above and beyond and the restaurant was over the top. The chef had prepared some amazing dishes that were out of this world and not so expensive that it hurt the wallet. We...

"3739",4,"Business trip, stay was pleasant and convenient"
"3740",4,"We found the rooms large, and comfortable. Price was affordable, staff were nice and helpful. We did find the room did not contain much in the way of utilises, and we had to call or drop down to get cups and glasses, etc. Shower were warm, not hot. Lower floor room might have been better."
"3741",4,"The hotel is well maintained and kept clean. The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean. All the staff I interacted with were very friendly and courteous. The continental breakfast is what you would expect at most hotels. Biggest disappointment was the reliability of the shuttle. One reason for choosing this hotel was the shuttle, and I was only able... More"
"3742",2,"Bad: This place wasn't just right for me: Booked a room with partial sea view - got one on the second floor which was blocked by a palm tree, staff was ok but tended to be on the arrogant side. Lots of younger people stayed there so if you are looking for a more boutique type of hotel that deserves the name you may want to look somewhere else. Good: The bed was very comfortable"

"3750",5,"Good: Best sleep I've had at a hotel"
"3751",4,"Near downtown sd, fashion shopping mall, easy access to highways. Beds semi comfortable. Fine for overnight lodging."
"3752",5,"Had a great stay, however no real complaints. I'm very picky with where I stay. The staff was beyond friendly, the hotel was well kept. They even had snacks when you enter and leave the hotel at the front door. Was very pleased. The only small issue was that the carpet in the room needed shampooing. I normally bring my slippers and forgot this time. Carpet had hair on floor needs better vacuuming and shampoo the walls in the room need touch up paint. It would literally take 20 min for when a quest leaves for walls to be touched up every so often. That was my only issue looking at a dirty wall. However I would stay again. Why are the racks for the towels inside the shower on the wall. Bad idea makes them get damp when you shower."
"3753",4,"I would highly recommend this hotel for its convenience to the Lahaina wharf. If you are going whale watching out of Lahaina, the boats leave just a few yards away from this hotel.

"3755",3,"Spent 3 nights at the BW Pluss Inn at the Vines, located just outside of downtown Napa. Perfect location for what we needed. Recommend using Uber for transportation, so easy and fast. It appeared that there was plenty of parking available in the downtown area, but we preferred to walk and enjoy.TwinCityGrl - Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We are conveniently only 1 mile from Downtown Napa, so a quick cab ride away and you're in the heart of everything. We hope you come and see us again soon."
"3756",3,"It was ok. I came back because i used the hotel Last year for the same tournament. Rate was good. But I missed my first round because the wake up call did not go through. When you hit the button for the wake up call an automated voice just says Thank you for your wakeup call I called the front desk and set the call but it never came through. Also requested a taxi and it never showed up"
"3757",3,"So-so, it was ok. Location is not the best, nothing arround."
"3758",3,"Not bad for the price. Some highway noise. Guest can not come to your room without you coming to down to get them."
"3759",5,"Loved it. Had a wonderful stay."
"3760",3,"Stayed one night for our medieval times trip. Booked a double bed. Staff very accommodating! Came with friends and was able to room close together.

"3761",5,"Service was excellent"
"3762",1,"This hotel did not meet my expectations. The room was sparsely furnished and not clean. There was a bunch of hair behind the bathroom door where staff had not cleaned the bathroom properly. The bed squeaked with every move and it was the only piece of furniture to sit on. The ceiling above us squeaked as well. No desk, no chair, no in-room coffee service, and no place to sit and relax outside. The entry door keypad was completely busted and the parking lot was deteriorating badly. Other chains have provided us far more comfort at the same price."
"3763",5,"I was surprised to find a newer Hilton at such a reasonable price. I thought there would be a catch though it turned out it was just a good find. Very nice."
"3764",5,"With the price, and with 4 kids tagging along, it was a pleasant stay! The front desk guy was Jermaine (if I recall correctly), and he was nice and very helpful. The lady at the breakfast station was also nice. In fact all the hotel staff that I met was nice and helpful."
"3765",5,"I have spent the last two birthdays at this hotel. It is the BOMB! Everything you want in a 5 star resort. I have so much fun. I visit the cafe for breakfast.

"3768",5,"If Justin Bieber and then-Bruce Jenner stays here, you know it has to be good. This Boutique hotel near downtown, may be small, but it offers friendly attentive service, wonderful facilities, delectable food (from a nearby in my view: 5 rated restaurant) and a good location."
"3769",4,"Very close to the Space Needle, EMP Museum and Duck Tour ride. Our room was close to the Monorail track but there was not much of disturbance. Walking distance to all attractions or you can take the Mono rail to down town locations. Very good breakfast. Rooms were very good with a small kitchen.SriGa,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge"
"3770",3,"Nice hotel good price. Need a hot breakfast added. We asked for extra pillows and were told they didnt have any. Pillows are worn and small."
"3771",5,"My wife fell in love with this resort the moment she entered the room. The view was gorgeous and the resort was kid friendly. The kitchen was nice and clean so was the laundry room. We wished we could stay longer than we planed."
"3772",4,"The motel has a pleasant classic feel and appearance which is slowly disappearing from our cities. It was clean and the grounds were well kept. I enjoyed the casual atmosphere.Prices were appropriate. The pool area is nicely set up."
"3773",4,"This is an affordable and newly renovated hotel. Very clean! Friendly staff. An excellent value. it is conveniently located right off the highway. Complimantary breakfast was not gourmet, but something for everyone."
"3774",5,"We had a great time enjoyed the great service, and how we were able to walk right to the beach. The breakfast in the morning was great we would recommend it to our friends. We can't wait to come back again"
"3775",3,"This was just an OK place to spend a night since it was close to our destination and was fairly inexpensive. You can tell it was an older hotel that has been renovated. Room was cleaned, but smelled of air freshener, probably to hide a smoke smell. Just didn't have that usual new Best Western feeling."
"3776",4,"We loved this midcentury hotel. The staff was very nice and they have some rooms that alow pets. The hotel has a small restaurant and bar with hand crafted cocktails and excellent food and a nice but limited wine list"
"3777",5,"The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked.."
"3778",4,"Bad: There were a lot of little costs we weren't expecting - parking being a big one. Good: Location, size of room, indoor pool"
"3779",5,"This an older motel, but kept in great condition by the owners. Very clean and quiet. Park the motorcycle right outside your room. Reasonalble rates too. Would definitely recommend. For the motorcyclists...ride up to Lake of the Clouds...worth the ride and nice, scenic roads in the area. Ask for an old towel from the owner to clean the bike. Access... More"
"3780",3,"Our flight got in late so we needed a place to stay. They sent a shuttle to pick us up at 12:30 AM. They gave us a double bed for my little one and had breakfast in the morning. It's clean with good staff. Plenty of parking. We also got a late checkout."
"3781",1,"Union organizers with megaphone reading union laws at 7 am! Due to the layout of the hotel it is amplified tenfold. Apparently there are no noise violations for doing this. Won't be back to Santa Monica better places to go that have better ordinances. Police just drive by like there is nothing going on."
"3782",4,"Staff were very friendly in general. Breakfast had a good selection. Rooms were kept clean and towels provided daily. We noticed a lot of school parties stay here and that some people hung out in the hallways which generated some noise. We were not impressed that 2 nights in a row we had to evacuate at around midnight taking our sleeping son out of his crib/cot. Lounge was not open through the week only on a Friday and Saturday - depending where you stay in hotel you may hear some noise. We arrived on a Friday night and there was a function on we had to park far away but there is plenty of parking available. Our room had a Refrigerator, microwave, Iron plus board. There was a slight concern for us as we were told that there may be no cribs left but thankfully we did get one. We were disappointed that the swimming pool was only open 6pm-10pm Mon-Fri and on Saturday and Sunday's it was 2pm-10pm. There is a small shop in foyer where you can buy essentials and various other items and there is also a computer and printer in this area too."
"3783",5,"Stayed 1 night. Room was very clean, very quiet, staff very friendly. A+. Location was good. Felt safe. Breakfast very good and efficient. Pool and hot tub very nice often long drive. Keep up the good work. Will be back. View of Goodyear factory after restoration was awesome. American historic buildings are so cool when refurbished and reutilized."
"3784",4,"So glad i got the splash and stay package. Had a great time at magic waters.One lady on 3rd shift was AWESOME. The lady that checked us in seemed like she didn't know much about the hotel or anything in the area. Rooms where OK, bed and pillows sucked. something could be done to the room to make it feel...

"3785",5,"Layout of the hotel and decor was too contemporary. The room was very comfortable"
"3786",3,"Loved this little town! The hotel was very comfortable and quiet. Older hotel but nicely refurbished with funky decor and good quality furniture and bedding. Staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful. Rooms are a bit small so wouldn't recommend for more than two people to a room. We would definitely stay here again!"
"3787",5,"Bad: (Valet) parking is expensive. Room was a bit small. Good: Very pleasant experience. The room was good, clean and had a rich minibar. Very nice bar/restaurant/breakfast accomodation. Personell (we were helped by luckas) was extraordinary kind and helpful."
"3788",4,"this was our first visit to Royal Anchor. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Loved the private beach.....only steps away from the hotel. This place is kept very clean, only thing I'd change would be the pillows. But that won't keep me from coming back. Will definitely be back!"
"3789",4,"I arrived a little earlier being I had been driving all night. I was ready to check into my room, but I had forgot that check-in time was at 3pm. I ask the desk clerk would it be ok if I could sit and wait the next 3 hrs in the lobby and she said yes. Well I guess she saw how tired I looked, she was nice enough to check with housekeeping to see if a room was ready. She allowed me to check in early and I am very grateful to her. Well I also want to commend the staff name Andre who were very helpful to make sure my stay at the hotel was satisfactory! Breakfast was stock when I went down and I was very please with the staff professionalism. I always stay at this hotel when I am in Suffolk, Va. Great Job"
"3790",3,"Today with the economy the way it is everyone is trying to make a dollar. That is understandable. My stay at the Suncoast lost its glitter when I was told I had to pay for a boarding pass to be printed. I could not believe that they do not include this courtesy for their guests. A daily charge of 5 was charged to my credit card. The explanation was that includes all local calls, a safe in the room, a small refrigerator and wi-fi. As far as I am concerned the refrigerator could be removed as a inclusion. I had a room that was extremely noisy and asked to be moved. It took them hours to get this accomplished. I refused to gamble there after being told about the charge for the printing of the boarding pass. We had dinner at the Red Rock and I decided to try and see if they would print my pass for me. I didn't think they would do it but I was shocked. They never asked me for money or even if I was staying there at the hotel as a guest. I explained to the desk clerk what had happened and they couldn't believe it. I was told they print lots of boarding passes for people as a courtesy not just guests of their hotel. This finished me with the Suncoast. I will never dtay there again while in Vegas. It's the principle of the thing that matters. They could have gained my respect and lots more business from my office. There is no reason for this to happen. It is not good PR at all. The Red Rock has all of my future business. No wonder the Republicans didn't go to the Suncoast. The Red Rock rolled out the carpet and knows how to treat people.Thank you for your feedback, and your comments. We do apologize your experience was unsatisfactory. I do want you to know we take all comments as an informational tool to help serve our customers in a more efficient way."
"3791",4,"Our room had been recently remodeled and was clean, comfortable and in a very convenient location. We were able to park just outside our room's front door making it easy to unload/load luggage. The Best Western Mesquite is a good value and close to good restaurants and excellent freeway access."
"3792",5,"No matter the occasion this is the place to stay. The restaurant is great as is the spa. The pools and hot tubs are clean and great views of the lake!! There was a wedding going on last time we were there. Tall about a perfect location for a wedding"

"3808",4,"We spent 5 nights here in a regular room in December. The good: We loved the building's character, and old NYC charm. The location can't be beat. The butlers were overall very helpful, especially Emina. The car service is lovely, and the driver we had (Robert) was very nice. The concierges were interacted with (I have forgotten names) were both superb. Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING after the first night. Very much appreciated. The bell staff and doormen were also mostly really great. We felt very welcomed most of the time we interacted with staff.The not as good: A few minor misses upon entering room for the first time - there was some debris from prior guests. One of the butlers didn't provide the same great service as the others. Nothing to be totally fussed about, but these misses stand out all the more against the otherwise stellar service. Really the only true disappointment was that we weren't impressed by our Room Service breakfast at all - best to skip.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and do recommend if it fits your NYC plans.Dear Nakoa G,Thank you very much for reviewing your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to write you review and provide us with your feedback. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your room and the Butler service, but are disappointed that you were not impressed with your Room Service breakfast. We will share your thoughts with our Food Beverage team and will be sure to address this internally. We hope to have an opportunity to welcome you back on your next trip to New York City.Kindest Regards,Senih GerayGeneral Manager"

Not being from the area we didn't no much about the places around us so upon asking the front desk staff (Vanessa) we where given directions to everything we could need.

"3810",5,"Was a great 1 night stay. Lobby was beautiful, very clean, nice personable staff. Rooms were very nice! Wish they had an option for a room w a King bed and a sofa bed, we needed to get the rollaway, which was ok, but only sleeps 1. Pool was nice, kids enjoyed for a bit. Breakfast buffet was great!

"3813",5,"The Best Western Inn at the Vines is conveniently located to the main entrance of the Napa Valley right near across the street walking distance to multiple places for shopping, entertainment, gas and dining. I had an easy relaxing time at this Hotel. The hotel staff were friendly informative and always helpful with my questions. The room was modern, clean and quiet.

"3816",3,"Bad: being told we had missed our free glass of wine as we arrived to late, how hard would it have been to just give us a glass, also being told no free breakfast included as we booked via bookings.com, when you book with bookings.com you want to feel valued not at a disadvantage. no kettle, what is it about Americans not putting a kettle for a nice cup of tea in each room, you will get liters of alcohol to buy but why not just put a 12 dollar kettle and two mugs, costs so little but means so much. would boost my scoring on every hotel review i do. Good: position on south beach road is great, roof top pool great, nice room, hotel a little tired, stained carpets cracked bathroom work tops etc. my advice would be replace carpets in room halls ways from lift to room. lots of stains. iced water by lift this is great. lovely bed and pillows.stayed one night, lovely lady on reception day we left, helped us get a taxi. I would stay again however its expensive a bottle of water in the room is about 6 dollars, drank in error not understanding it was a cost option. drink iced water in reception, very nice."

"3818",5,"Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip. I felt this was unnecessary and made guests feel uncomfortable. The breakfast was self service, the waiters just brought tea and coffee. Good: This hotel was lovely, very clean, good breakfast and friendly staff. Good situation,about 5 minutes walk to The Strip."

It was supposed to be a non smoking hotel but someone on my floor kept smoking which was a turn off. The room was clean but they didn't leave conditioner or moisturizer and left one teeny shampoo.

"3832",3,"The hotel caters to pets, and that's fine when you need it. The room was dirty (expected since there are so many animals involved). I would not stay there when I'm not traveling with a pet. Bathroom was okay typical for a hotel in this price range."
"3833",4,"Had a really nice stay at hotel renew. Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience.

"3839",4,"Bad: As others have commented the Valet Parking at 35 per day is steep however it is known before you sign up to it, there is a parking lot close by that only charges 15 per day although not sure what they would charge if you wanted to leave overnight. Good: Very good location on Ocean Drive but away from the noise of the main area. Breakfast was ideal, plenty of choice and had the added bonus available until noon Rooms were clean and tidy and we did not find them small and we had two large suitcases in each as well as other hand luggage. Staff always acknowledged you"

This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in!

So small the door hit the toilet when closing. Overall this was a nice stay. Bed was comfortable. Lots of room space and dog friendly. I would stay here again."
"3848",4,"Nice hotel/ great location"
"3849",4,"We liked the hotel very much. The room was quite cosy. There was a shuttle service to the nearest subway station. The only thing I did not like is that our check-in receptionist wanted us to pay only by card. But the payment conditions of our cards do not allow taking money without entering a PIN code and by ourselves. The receptionist insisted by demanding if otherwise a 200 deposit (we had not known about this condition before) and we agreed about the card. The payment result in one day was declined payment and a blocked by our bank card (as the bank considered the payment suspicios or the card as stolen by an American). So, finally we paid cash. Please, respect customers and their banks' attempt to protect them. But altogether I did like our stay there and enjoyed it."

Emily in the restaurant suggested a couple of her go to specials, and she was right on. Delicious!! The hotel was in immaculate condition. The rooms are large and very quiet.

"3895",4,"We chose this hotel because of the location and we weren't disappointed. Right opposite the music museum, science museum and space needle. Happy Hour at the bar offered a good selection of local beers and wines. The rooms weren't huge but comfortable and clean. The breakfast was buffet style and a little bit busy with everybody having to convene in a small corridor area where the buffet is served but lots to choose from. Omelettes can be made to order. Convenient to walk the short mile to Pike Place and also to savour many of the great restaurants in the neighbourhood. One negative comment is that there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel, so you could be waiting quite a while for the elevator to come to your floor if it was first thing in the morning and everybody was heading to breakfast. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to guests.Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this review! We are so pleased to hear that you got to experience the neighborhood attractions. We are totally biased, but we think it's pretty great as well! We feel privileged to have had you as our guest - we hope it won't be the last time.

"3898",4,"Overall, the stay was good. The staff, however, was a mixed bag. Lady at front desk was friendly enough, but gave us the wrong times for breakfast (telling us that breakfast was served to 10:00 on Fridays when it really stopped at 9:00 my teenage daughters almost missed breakfast). Also, the woman who drives the early morning shuttle to the airport as well as served breakfast on Wednesday morning was extremely RUDE. Made snarky comments to customers in the breakfast room and left a poor family with small children on their way to the airport, telling them that there was no more room in the shuttle when there was plenty of room. (My family were the only people on the shuttle and we pointed out that there was plenty of room and we were fine with waiting while they loaded on, but she would not wait for them.) On the other hand, the nice brunette, younger woman who worked the breakfast room on Thursday through Saturday morning was super friendly and accommodating and even made extra eggs for my daughters on the morning that they almost missed breakfast."
"3899",5,"The staff was very professional and helpful. The room's are very modern and clean. I was very please with the complimentary continental breakfast of eggs, fruit orange juice french toast and waffles and coffee. I would highly recommend this establishment."

"3908",5,"Great"
"3909",4,"Our stay was short but convenient for what we had planned. The price was great. My only negative would be that I was not allowed to accumulate Wyndham points, because I used a booking agent."
"3910",1,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE"
"3911",3,"The price was really good, but I was disappointed when I checked in and they did not have the room I booked. I booked a king and all they could give me was two doubles. They said I could move the next day, but I decided to stay in my same room rather than packing everything back up again. The room was definitely in need of some maintenance, but nothing major. I would stay there again, as long as I get the room I actually book next time."
"3912",2,"I stayed there for a week on a business trip. I wasn't looking for anything special, but The hotel seemed rundown. I didn't realize that that the corridors were external, which isn't a huge problem, but they were painting them while I was there making it inconvient to get around. The room and bathroom were shabby as well. What really did it for me though was when I packing to check out on the last day I found a small broken piece of glass tube under the bed. Curiousity got the best of me so I took it the training class I was finishing up and asked a police officer in the same class what looked like to him. He said that it was a piece of crack or meth pipe."

"3919",5,"Love this hotel. Beautiful lobby and very good restaurants. The coffee in the room was delicious and the maker easy to use-sometimes one must move the coffee maker etc... The best part of the trip is that the hotel is quiet. I couldn't hear other doors in my hallway banging closed."
"3920",5,"Could not fault the Carneros Inn - although high end, worth every penny. The Boon Fly Cafe is great for breakfast, but exceptional for dinner. Does great cocktails and their Fried Chicken was the best I've ever had."

"3924",5,"I was there to visit my daughter and her family, that live in Porstmouth, VA. The hotel is very close to them. I was able to bring my dog. The hotel staff allowed me to leave and leave my dog loose in the room, which was AWESOME! They even assured me that if he got loud, they would just call me. The room was a studio..plenty of room for us both. The hotel was refurbished a year ago. They offer breakfast each morning, waffles, fruit, cereal, etc. They even have snacks, drinks, for sale. Plus anything you might have forgotten! Love this place! I will go back regularly!"
"3925",2,"We had two rooms for the weekend and we may have just been there on a bad weekend or something because we planned on leaving around 830 on sunday morning and upon waking up there was no hot water, one of the rooms air conditioning units had stopped working in the middle of the night and it was a humid evening, so we went to the continental breakfast to find no toaster and stale fruit loops. Hot water was available but not until about 1030 so we were about 3 hours behind schedule when all is said and done and we had to stop and grab some breakfast."
"3926",5,"We stay here all the time when visiting family in the area. This is my favorite Hampton Inn. Great rooms, super staff, great breakfast, good location close to shops, mountains and beach.

As far as the room goes,... More"
"3947",5,"This hotel was a bit older but very well maintained. The room was spacious with a separate full kitchen and a walk-in closet. There was zero noise from elevators or guests above or next door, unlike many newer hotels we've stayed in. Our only complaint was that the place was a bit difficult to find after dark - the sign is not high enough to be easily visible. In daylight, we discovered it was extremely easy to travel right next door to the Arlington Cemetary or across the Arlington Bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, etc. The price was very reasonable and we would definitely stay here again."

"3949",1,"We requested 4 non smoking rooms. When we checked in we only had 2 non smoking and the hotel was sold out. My of thr rooms we had to kill a roach. Another room I was personally bite up from some type of black bug. They treated my room and offered to move me to there other location which was an inconvenience. The carpet in all of our rooms was dirty and mine was dirty and torn. One of the rooms had a 90 dollar charge under Other which the hotel could not explain so they removed it. And when they were checking my bed to see what was biting me, it was particulars on the box spring that did not belong to me. So how was that possible if they had put on new linen prior to me coming. I would not recommend this hotel nor would I return. They did give me two night comp stay for another location for my troubles but I dont beleive it was enough."
"3950",5,"Stayed at two different hotels in seattle. The maxwell is a gret location for the space needle, seattle center, science center, sculpture garden, etc. another huge benefit was the free parking- which is rare in seattle. The room came with many nice complimentary ammenities- kuerig coffee, popcorn, tea, shuttle rides, etc. For the price- this place was unbeatable."
"3951",5,"Very nice hotel. Clean rooms, good free breakfast offered. We had a very nice stay. Good beds and friendly staff. Hotel looks like it is brand new. Close to several restaurants right next door. We felt safe in the hotel."
"3952",4,"Very nicely decorated in retro fashion. Loved the steamer versus the traditional iron.Very friendly and accommodating staff.Although location is within walking distance to the French Quarter, would not recommend walking late at night. We found ourselves a bit turnaround when walking back from French Quarter. We stopped in at the Emergency Department of Tulane Hospital for directions who advised us that it was not safe to be walking in this area. They called us a cab despite the fare being very short (a few blocks). Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. The comments of our guests are important for others to get a feel of our property and location. Sorry to hear you got turned around, be sure to let our concierge assist you with a map on your next visit.WayneGeneral Manager"
"3953",5,"We arrived at the beginning of July for a 7 night stay. Check in was quick staff friendly. We were upgraded to a room with a kingsize bed given free wifi on the 11th floor.Throughout our stay our room was kept spotless with fresh towels and shampoos etc refilled on a daily basis. On our last day we were able to stay in our room until 13.00hrs at no extra charge then our suitcases stored by the staff for 1 per case.We asked about purchasing a jar of cookies to bring home but unfortunately they were not available until 17.00hrs, however seeing the disappointment on our faces Jessica went the extra mile spoke with management we were able to purchase two tins We also were given a few free ones to have on our journey home!We will definitely return to this hotel when we are next back in New York. Ideal location and close enough to be within a short walk of Times Square but away from the hustle bustle of all the crowds. Thank you to all the staff at this hotel.Thanks for sharing this lovely review, Kathryn!We're thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay with us at our prime location to Times Square. It's our pleasure to accommodate you and we appreciate your praise. Jessica is an excellent member of our team. She always goes above and beyond for our guests. You can see why we love having her here so much!We're looking forward to sharing another amazing experience with you soon. Have a beautiful day!"
"3954",4,"Bad: The restaurant was less the expected. Food was cold and cleanliness thought-out the restaurant wasn't appetizing. For the prices and advertising it didn't come close. Good: Sean at the check-in was very friendly as well as the rest of the staff. Hotel is in the perfect location without the price. Clean and quiet."
"3955",2,"They charged me 150 for smoking in my room. I do not smoke. There was one person who did smoke in the room, at a wimdow, window were left open. As a non smoker I can smell when a room has been smoked in. The room had NO smoking odor. A small fee for breaking the rules would have been acceptbale. They were unfair about it."
"3956",5,"Great stay - very satisfied and pleased with the quality! Very conveniently located and very nice indoor pool! It was January but the outdoor pool looked nice! As a courtesy because the room was not ready they gave us free breakfast and a movie - and a different great room. very clean and good service."
"3957",5,"Bad: The bed was too soft for my mate and we need more pillows. They were happy to provide the additional pillows. Good: The entire staff was very nice. The room was clean and we stayed on the north-side and did not hear any noise from Fremont Street."
"3958",4,"Would stay again. Enjoyed our stay. Only problem was we had no refreg. or microwavE in one of the rooms. The trolley to kings dominion was not always available. Waited for 45 minutes and then I walked. Enjoyed the dog kennel on kings dominion site."
"3959",4,"I have stayed at this hotel for the past several years and find it to be well kept and clean. Staff are friendly and accommodating. It is located in a quiet part of town though remains close to a major road for easy access. Would recommend this location to others."
"3960",4,"Bad: Insufficient service at the reception, had to wait at check in and out, only 1 or 2 staff. Good: Helpful staff, excellent service, comfort, location, luxury."
"3961",4,"Met a group of guys down in Portsmouth for a weekend of NSW training. Didn't spend a ton of time at the hotel but I was pleased with my stay. The room was very clean. Had a nice comfortable king bed. Plenty of room. Had a couch as well. Breakfast wasn't all that. Had a waffle maker, eggs, sausage, sausage sandwiches, cereal, bagels, toast etc.. the sausage was that microwave junk. ate it the first morning but that was it. I didn't check anything else in the hotel out or have a need to seek service. I would stay there again."

"3964",5,"Some years ago,my father in-law selected this hotel and we had a great time. After he stopped going the rest of us went down again but stayed somewhere else. Big mistake ,so this time it was without question as to where we were going. This will be our spot every year for a week. The people are great as well."
"3965",4,"Hotels.com had a good price vs. what the hotel wanted for one night over the labor day weekend. This is a good value if you spend in 100/ night range. The staff was accomodating to my early check-in request, breakfast was alright, and noise level was surprisingly quiet. All-in, a good experience."
"3966",4,"Great location. We had always stayed in Pigeon Forge and traveled to Gatlinburg. We decided to stay in Gatlinburg and walk to the sights. What a great time we had. This hotel is located a block from the Aquarium and within walking distance to EVERYTHING! We will definitely stay again :-)"
"3967",3,"We stayed here to go to the Legoland Discovery Center. The hotel provides free transportation to Phipps Plaza and complimentary breakfast so that was great. I would recommend this hotel for families. It's clean and the staff is amazing."

"3974",4,"I had stayed at this Hampton Inn many years ago and it was the typical Hampton. They have upgraded since and the accommodations are very nice. My wife and I were very impressed by the room and the friendly staff. Next door to Applebees and in close proximity to many restaurants and not too far from UGA and downtown Athens."
"3975",5,"Even though I'm a local I stayed here with a group before a cruise. Right across from the space needle and they offer a shuttle for the downtown area. Because its across from the Monorail station it makes getting downtown super easy. New rooms with electric shades, refrigerators and microwaves. While rooms are slightly smaller the furnishings are top notch. The breakfast buffet is great with an omelette bar and lots of fresh fruits. Lobby bar and restaraunt is very reasonable and good. I'd be happy to recommend this hotel to friends and travelers as its super nice.davidgmg,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your staycation here in Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

"3981",3,"During my recent stay at the Hilton I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the room. However, the staff made the correction and re-cleaned the room. I had a great stay, the food was great and the restaurant staff was wonderful. Overall the stay was nice and the hotel was quiet."
"3982",5,"Bad: Very satisfied."
"3983",4,"My boyfriend and I stayed here a weekend in July for our anniversary. Wanted to visit Baltimore but not pay the prices for the Inner Harbor hotels. This hotel was perfect. It was extremely affordable for a 2 night weekend stay and surpassed our expectations. It was only a 15 minute drive to Inner Harbor. The staff was very friendly and the room was great. Room was spacious, updated and SO clean. Felt like a mini apartment. Also one of the few hotels we found that had an outside pool. I would definitely recommend this hotel!"
"3984",4,"I stayed this hotel for 4 days to travel washington dc. Its locations is pretty good to go convenient facilities. However, if your purpose of visiting dc is to travel, you need to have a car. I would stay here next visiting dc."
"3985",4,"Pluses: reasonable rates, great helpful friendly staff, shuttle to trains, nearby mall, lots of dining choices minutes from hotel. Minuses : mattresses old and needing update, rooms dark more lights will help lots, a refrigerator is a must in a room. Long ride into town by train and 5-6 bucks each way. Tip: leave your car at the station for 5 bucks and fast return to hotel or mall."
"3986",4,"Bad: Mattresses too hard, carpet on lobby too old. Good: Locarion"

"3993",3,"Bad: The entire place smells like an ashtray. The rooms were small and the place is noisy. It's a complete freak show under the canopy---ugly people who are 90 nude with no talent. Wall to wall beggars and hawkers. The entire Las Vegas is full of annoying street hustlers and creeps. What a waste of our First Amendment Rights! Next time I go to LV, I will stay in a South Vegas Hotel, go to a show and leave the next day. Too bad Vegas is stuck with such a beggar and homeless problem. Good: It was on my bucket list and I wanted to experience the canopy light show---ok, check it off. Good deals on food: Tony Roma's is located within the Fremont Hotel and steak and lobster for 11.99 is a DEAL! The Valet Parking was free and excellent. The entire Staff was excellent but seemed embarrassed to be in such a dump. It was cheap but you pay for it if your not a smoker."

"4007",5,"We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston! In fact Im planning on a business trip to Cambridge soon and considering staying here and commuting.Dear mnmorange,So glad to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with your family at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston, with all of the city so easily accessible just outside our doors. It is wonderful to know that you and your children were well taken care of by the friendly and professional ladies and gentlemen throughout the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your visit. We hope you will return for that upcoming business trip - getting to Cambridge from the hotel is a breeze - as well as many more occasions, when it will be our sincere pleasure to welcome you back.Warmest regards,William P. Bunce, General Manager"
"4008",5,"Comfortable, quiet, friendly staff. The lobby is amazing and a great place to meet for drinks. The room I had was small, but functional. Elevators were always available.Overall, this is a nice gem in downtown Philadelphia close to City Hall and restaurants. I highly recommend it.Todd,Being a part of the opening team, I have said from day one, even during construction, that our lobby would be the most beautiful and exciting in the city. It is always great to hear that our guests such as yourself feel the same! Our team is always working hard to ensure that you have a quiet and relaxing stay, and I am glad that you felt we were successful in that attempt. I hope we see you again soon!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager"

"4010",4,"My family and I stayed at this hotel last night. Everything was okay except for the swimming pool, it was cold. The breakfast was excellent (having waffles, danish, cereal, sausage, eggs, yogurt, beverages). The interior needs to be remodeled. The attendant was very friendly."

Key didnt work clean up lady was more help than the front desk staff. Get a name brand hotel maybe a few minutes further away from downtown than this place."
"4013",5,"I got a 'thank you for staying with us' email with the above words in it. On my last trip I had just left the Suncoast and was talking to a slot attendent at the Mirage who also likes the Suncoast. He asked why I liked it so much and I said I did not know - now I know - I feel so comfortable here. I stay at the Suncoast for 2-3days every 2months as part of a longer10-11 day holiday. It is not the Strip but it is still a nice casino - a locals casino with bowling, a cinema and bingo hall. But it also has a conference centre / banuet hall. You do not look out over the Strip but you can look out over a golf course and their nice pool area. When I stay on the Strip I actually ask for a Mountain View room - rather than a view of McDonalds and Walgreens! Even though I am a semi regular I am treated as a local. If I room charge I do not need to show ID - that's OK - we know you. The Cocktail waitresses even remember what I like to drink. They like my English accent! I had changed the dates of mt stay and the receptionist spotted that my dining credit had not been carried over so she corrected that. They now have sofas for the rest of your party can rest while you sign-in. The area is smoke-free - for those not used to casinos but I still say I do not recognise the casino as being smokey. I like the buffet for breakfast (8.50 inc tax) but then Du-Pars for Dinner where I can sit and have the food brought to me. The wine is 5 a glass 4-7pm - a nice end to the day. I'm interested in trying PengZu. The menu is on the Suncoast website and has some interesting dishes that attract this 61yo white guy. For burgers etc they have The Game sportsbar or the bowling alley snack bar - I have enjoyed both. Some days I do not feel hungary but I am tired so I get a Subway and a bottle of wine from the Gift shop (Glen Ellen Cabenet 4) and retire to my room. There is a refrigerator in the room. Du-Pars do the room service but the menu was missing from my room the last two trips. At some hotels that would be an issue but not at the Suncoast. My next trip will be in May with a suite at NYNY, a room at the Suncoast and a suite at the Mirage. I have asked for a Tuscany suite on eStandby. If I do not get it I will be happy with my 550sqft Suncoast room with floor to ceiling windows. I can get a bus from outside NYNY (or the airport) to the Suncoast for 2 - the Westcliffe Express (WAX). The bus can take me back to the Strip and somedays it has taken me to Downtown to visit the Suncoast's sister properties.Awesome! We love to see five-star experiences. We are glad our mission is fulfill through you experience with us! Thank you for visiting us! See you again, next time!"
"4014",4,"The Club Quarters is a good hotel to stay at if you are looking for a place to stay with a good price and within walking distance to clubs and the Toyota center. We were able to take a short 10 minute walk to the Toyota center at night as well as bars and clubs nearby. The only complaint I would have is that parking is not free as the hotel itself does not have a parking area. There is a parking lot nearby where you can pay for meter parking but need to insert cash into the meter every so often which is tricky because you can forget. Valet price wasn't bad, 25 for 24 hours and you can come in and out as many times as you want with no extra charge. We chose this option and it worked out great because we didn't have to worry about our car. Hotel has free water bottles downstairs, a keurig machine in the rooms, a kitchen area with a small fridge, stove and microwave and glassware inside the room, and a coffee machine in the lobby."
"4015",2,"Booked for overnight stay prior to cruise. Arrived at hotel around 2PM amid lots of ongoing confusion with other guests in the lobby.

"4018",3,"We stayed here the night before our cruise departed. The rooms are far from the office, pool and breakfast room. Rooms are a bit small but clean. Breakfast was good but crowded. The front office seemed to be understaffed for the volume of visitors."
"4019",4,"Staff were very friendly and professional at check in. Rooms were clean, spacious and ready when we arrived. The area has some great places to eat and a very nice movie theatre next door.

"4024",4,"Bad: I didn't like that check-in 'begins' at 4pm. You check in and wait for them to call you when your room is ready. Ours was ready at 6p. This was more of a plain hotel, not like a 'Vegas' hotel. Food, entertainment, and 'gambling' were limited. This is the best spot to be AWAY from Vegas while IN Vegas...if that's what you're looking for. Good: All amenities were top of the line."

"4029",5,"I have booked this hotel for employees on several trips for an installation project in town. I have gotten several great reports from each trip by employees. The staff and manager are always kind, courteous, and on top of things. Rooms are always clean and inviting. The hotel is centrally located for restaurants, beach, businesses, and shopping."
"4030",1,"You get what you pay for. The rooms were old and beat up. I slept all of 2 hours the whole night as I felt like there were bugs crawling on me in the bed. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Breakfast was....a joke. Spend the extra and stay at a better hotel."
"4031",5,"We got an awesome price for our room. When we arrived the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room is spacious, clean, and has everything you could possibly need. The pools are great and your so close to the beach."
"4032",4,"Hotel room had great view. Was clean. Chic. And accommodating. However the air conditioning kept my partner from sleeping well that night. We stayed on 20 floor and in July Kansan heat he got hot. When we arrived the fridge was warm and barely cooled off our food."
"4033",3,"Im not sure if Ill be other reviewers are used to sleeping in tents, because I dont understand why it would be so great about this place. It has a feeling of age about it, like it was built 30 years ago and trying to look modern but failing.While Ive stayed in the worse hotel rooms, theres certainly nothing distinctive for attractive about this place. Frankly, my wife and I were thinking that we wouldve been better off just trying to sleep at the airport terminal then spend the night here.Thank you for taking the time to provide us feedback about your stay! I am sorry that you were not impressed with our facilities. We just had our exterior renovated in April 2018 and we look forward to getting an interior refresh soon. We like to think that so many of our guests give us great reviews because of our exemplary service.

Beds were very comfortable and the free admission to the indoor waterpark was awesome. I think very highly of this hotel."
"4047",4,"The Central Loop Hotel is in the middle of the hustle bustle of downtown Chicago. They offer a lovely sitting room for visitors to enjoy a cup of coffee and visit with other travelors which we found a plus while using Chicago as a central meeting place for an annual get together with my husbands family. The hotel is very clean and the staff excellent, working to make your vist the best it can be. The restaurant in the hotel had good food with great coffee making it a good choice for a convenient breakfast. The rooms are average, but very clean, although we found them a bit stingy with linnens offering just one towel per person. The best part of this hotel is the location making it within walking distance of the museums and shopping. I highly recommend this hotel if you are ok with staying in a busy, central location."

The room was dirty, the bed was very uncomfortable. In the morning when I went to check out I waited for the woman to get off the phone before a rude man busted in front of me and asked to be checked out.

Im sure hoping that it will be replaced as part of the renovation. My stay was satisfactory, but couldve been nicer without all the work going on."
"4065",4,"Loved the fireplace and full kitchen. WiFi could have been better. Loved the view from the living room. I will come back for special occasions in the future. Very cozy, but bedroom was not heated. We had to leave the bedroom door open and leave the gas fireplace on to heat the bedroom, but it still was a little cool."

"4081",4,"Bad: There was NOTHING we disliked! The room was small but that was to be expected and the two of us were very comfortable there.

Close to the T, the airport shuttle, historic churches, Public Library (also an attraction in itself), Prudential SkyDeck, the amazing Newbury St. with all the shops and restaurants... I could go on and on. 2. Excellent staff - attentive, helpful, understanding, flexible... overall very pleasant without being over the top. 3. A small place that felt like home, without that big corporate hotel feel. 4. A good continental breakfast that never ran out of any items. 5. Free WiFi that ran very well. 6.

"4099",5,"IT WAS A PLEASURE TO STAY AT THIS HOTEL. VERY CLEAN FRIENDLY STAFF. There was construction at this site initiative done a better job cleaning the area outside not leaving everything this laying outside it was not very pleasant to see."
"4100",5,"This hotel was really great! I had read many reviews of hotels in the area before booking, and this one was a winner in most categories and I can see why! The room was excellent, very clean, very modern, very nice. The only reason I went down on the comfort was that I found the bed to be a little hard for my liking, but I have back issues, so that could be why. The staff was amazing. I ended up becoming very ill, and they were very accommodating and empathetic, and that was greatly appreciated. The breakfast was excellent, a good spread with many options. The pool and hot tub were nice, especially in the evening. The location is directly on the beach, and the balconies allow for a fantastic view (even when you are lying ill on the couch!). I would most definitely stay here again, and it was an excellent price, making it that much better!"
"4101",4,"I stayed for 2 nights here where the rooms and service met up with other Marriott properties I have stayed in the past. Like the other reviews here, the only issue here was hearing the train whistle. As I grew up close to a train crossing, hearing it didn't bother me but I could see how someone not used to it could be really shaken by the experience.Other than that, they offer a value-filled room with kitchenette, a well-equipped one at that. Similar to Residence Inn properties, there's a fridge, dishwasher, sink, and stove along with some basic cookware and utensils. This property even had a food disposal unit.As much as there was a bed, living area, bathroom, kitchenette, and work desk, there really wasn't much place to sit down and eat for more than one person. I suppose a group of people could eat in the living area but I wouldn't find it all that comfortable.The services available in the lobby were fantastic, there a computer with free internet AND free printing (although there's a 30-minute time limit to be fair to other guests). There's also complimentary coffee available all day and even a map of the general area where the attractions, shopping, and restaurants are listed."
"4102",3,"This motel looks like it was once a family gathering place. There is an old swing set and gazebo. The theatre theme in the rooms is giving way to an update of the decor. The motel was our stopover between dives on the Osprey. There is not much choice in town unless you look to a bed and breakfast or... More"
"4103",4,"Stay was good at nice, cosy, quite Hotel at Virginia Tech. Surrounding was also very cool and Calm and is good for nice walk in the morning and evening. It is central to the Blacksburg town and mostly University visitors stay."
"4104",4,"This hotel is clean and well kept. It looks to be newer than it actually is. It is convenient to stores and restaurants. The staff is friendly and courteous. The rooms are a good size. I found the pillows to be small and too soft for my liking. The only room available was for special needs, this was not expected. it lacked a bath tub. but the shower was ok. None of the soda machines worked correctly. It is not to close to the beach and there is no view of the harbor."
"4105",4,"Absolutely like the laminate floors in the rooms instead of carpeting. You can sense clean instead of what can be in carpeting. Rooms are pretty standard fare but not cramped.

"4121",5,"We arrived at almost midnight after a long day of flying in from out of the country. The staff member who checked us in was so pleasant and helpful and even gave us 2 complimentary bottles of water. The hotel was clean, beds comfortable, and a great location to BWI. We would definitely recommend the Hilton."
"4122",3,"Was looking for a quite hotel off the strip and it totally fit. Property and room were average, but very clean and quiet. Staff was great. Food at their caf was very good. Convenient to use monorail, station was just across the road."
"4123",3,"Stayed here to catch NYC at Christmas and were excited to stay in a legendary hotel. We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay. Dear NOIDK, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted. Our management team may be reached at GeneralManagerNYStRegis.com, and we would then be able to arrange a time at your convenience to speak.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"

The Concierge Lounge was well staffed also and provided several amenities, however it is only open Monday through Friday. Our room was comfortable... More"
"4127",3,"Overall, it was okay. First it was in a sketchy neighborhood. The hotel was old but clean. The room itself was nice. Comfortable king size bed with a fold out chair. They had a decent breakfast spread. I was disappointed to find that the boiler wasn't working, after I booked the room. No discount or compensation was offered."

Our sponsors are not happy with our performance.... We could not get to sleep after that, but we did try, then just when I started to fall asleep again, the alarm came in again at 5:38 (sometime around then )... So since I wasn't offered any compensation,. Not sure if we will return... By the way, your staff is really great!... The food was great, should have opened earlier since the alarms kept everyone up..."
"4129",3,"Ok for the price.. the bed was hard.. woke every morning. With a backache. The ""hot breakfast"" was a tub of bland mushing oatmeal."
"4130",4,"I booked at this hotel because on the NIH Clinical Center website, it was one of the hotels listed as convenient to the NIH. However, that is false! You can take the metro red line to the NIH, but it will take you a long time, as it is several stops away. One morning, it took me 2 hours from leaving the hotel to arriving at the NIH because there was track maintenance! If you are in town to visit the NIH, I don't recommend staying here. Otherwise, the hotel is fine, the room was a little small, but clean. Also, the elevator interiors could use some upgrading. The carpet was dirty and ragged."

"4134",4,"Da wir nur eine Nacht in Charleston bleiben konnten, war es uns wichtig m√∂glichst zentral im Herzen des ""Historic Charleston"" zu wohnen. Die Lage ist auch wirklich super. Auch sonst hatten wir nichts an dem Hotel auszusetzen, obwohl die Fotos vielleicht ein bisschen mehr vermuten lassen als tats√§chlich dahinter ist und auch das Wort ""Grand Hotel"" etwas hochgegriffen ist.Das Zimmer war gro√ü und sauber, dasBett bequem, das Personal freundlich und entgegenkommend, die Lage super."

"4139",5,"I went with my extended family (brothers, kids, uncle and grand parent), we took more than 9 rooms for a week. We had great vacation! Friendly staff, great pool, near the beach. room are clean. The wifi is not very performing, that would be my only complain."
"4140",2,"The good points: it's relatively inexpesive, it was clean, and the service was good. The bad: it's close to a heavily used road (think noise), and its not quaint or luxurious. The brochure claims that you get a complimentary Breakfast. But what they actually give you is 2.50 off your breakfast at Dennys. This basically covered the cost of our coffee. I don't think Dennys has a breakfast on the menu for 2.50."
"4141",5,"Bad: Wifi strength not great for end room. Good: Staff, location, rooms"
"4142",1,"I could not stay because the room that was given to my family and I was dirty and with a bad smell. The sheets had yellow dirty spots and to add to all this, the air conditioner did not work. The hotel did not want to give my money back, but when I called Hotel.com they took care of everything to me. I've got my refund."
"4143",4,"Great hotel across street from metro, nice pool and sauna. Great ritz service."
"4144",5,"Nice quiet hotel in the middle of all attractions. ..clean and beautiful rooms."
"4145",1,"I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel."

"4147",4,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night for the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington this past weekend. It was more than adequate for being a place to spend the night. We liked that the room and bathroom were spacious. The location was ideal for someone who drove to the area. I believe the hotel also has a shuttle to the nearby metro station. It is a 15-20 minute drive to Washington in regular, non-congested traffic. The breakfast buffet was standard but I would really expect much for the price we paid. I like that they have their own parking lot and they are just down the street from numerous fast food establishments and a supermarket. The gentleman at the reception desk was a bit short with us and another couple who were checking in before is but nothing that is worth complaining about. Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is a good bargain and is close to highway access and public transportation."
"4148",5,"We were there for a youth wrestling tournament so we stayed for just 1 night. It was close to the events center, but it wasn't right in the downtown area where you'd have parking hassles. It was close to the interstate so we could easily get to other parts of the city."
"4149",4,"It was memorable stay in Aria Resort, very good valet service and friendly staff at the reception. Rooms are big size and all the controls are at our finger. Ample shopping area and great restaurants. This city center hotels and resort is very attractive structure and good value for money and much more."
"4150",2,"The room was not clean, The light did not work over the vanity and the TV did not work. Had we known the TV did not work before morning we would've asked for another room."
"4151",4,"Bad: We had breakfast on two days in the hotel. One day (Sunday) the service was great - the next day it was very poor. While the hotel is quite central, the choice of restaurants very close to the hotel is not good. Good: Front desk staff were friendly and happy to give advice etc. Nice hotel with funky rooms. Room we had was a bit noisy at night - can turn the fridge off but still noise from air con or something else."
"4152",3,"Nice large rooms, but our A/C did not work well, especially in the bedroom. This was a higher priced King Corner Suite. Only stayed for 1 night, so told front desk staff on the way out. Happy hour is a nice idea, but no way to get near the small and understaffed bar to get a drink. Could not check in at 1:00, had to wait until 3 pm, which is the rule, but would have been nice to find a room earlier. Breakfast was very good."
"4153",3,"My first night, my room was ok, but the AC fan or housing made a racket. I actually removed the plastic covering because it was broken and I thought that's what was rattling...wrong. I probably should have requested a new room, but by then I had my toiletries unpacked and didn't feel like moving. I was tired, so I slept through the noise, no problem. My second night I asked for a different room - the AC was still noisy, must just be 'normal'. The halls smelled a little musty, but the shining light of the stay was the front desk and housekeeping personnel. I had forgotten an expensive temperpedic pillow in my first room that I take with me when I travel. I didn't notice that I didn't have it until I was ready to go to bed the 2nd night (in a different room). The front desk people were very attentive, but housekeeping had gone home for the night or something and the front desk didn't have the key to their storage room....SO, I had to wait until I checked out the next morning to get me pillow back. But I DID get my beloved pillow back, so, all's well that ends well."
"4154",5,"It was very quiet. Breakfast was the same thing everyday."
"4155",2,"I'll start this review by saying that Honua Kai is not a Hotel or a Resort. It's amazing that they charge a 25.00 resort fee, because this place is merely a Condominium Complex.

"4156",4,"The staff is really nice and they go out of there way too help. The guy seems easily frustrated but it is understandable when people spell the name wrong, like I did.

"4157",4,"We chose this hotel because of its proximity to Troegs brewery and Hershey Park. We enjoyed the modern, comfortable, and quiet room. The staff was exceptional and the accommodations were enjoyable. Both Troegs and Hershey were an easy 15 min drive. If we decide to do another overnight stay in Hershey, we will definitely stay again!"
"4158",2,"Unacceptable, unprofessional behavior.1. Couldn't get into room because I wasn't on the reservation. 2. Person let into room who wasn't on the reservation.3. Unreliable housekeeping.4. Double-charged for entire stay... WHEN I WASN'T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION.So, to begin... My friend PREPAID with her card for a room for us to share, but requested that my name be added to the reservation since I would arrive in NOLA hours before her. There's a whole email trail to prove they agreed, had my name spelled correctly, etc. I arrived, and they're like who are you I'm tired. I've been traveling. I need to shower, but no. I can't get into the room until hours later when my friend lands and gets it sorted from her Uber. I check us in using my card for incidentals, saying they'd only put a 50 hold on my card if we charged something to the room (we didn't). My friend arrives three hours later, but basically gets into our room about 15 minutes after I do. Once she's there, she tells me a pretty funny story. Her bf and his friends had another room, and even though he never put them on the reservation at all, they gave them keys! I had documentation and couldn't get into my room, and they, complete strangers for all the hotel knows, just waltzed into theirs! A huge security issue!The room itself was nice enough, and so was the pool however, the pool bar closed at random times despite having official posted hours. The bartenders were rude, as was most of the hotel staff (except for the doormen, who were delightful). Our room was only cleaned half the days of our stay. Housekeeping didn't replenish the toiletries when they did clean the room, and with two women, we obviously ran out of shampoo. When we called the front desk, around 10pm, they said they'd run out! At 11pm they came with a bag (and I mean garbage bag) full of.... lotion Because that helps. So both my friend and I showered without washing our hair, only to have housekeeping show up again at 2AM IN THE MORNING, banging on the door, with one bottle of shampoo that I guess they found. Not only was it late, but it was LATE.And now the worst part, to top it all off: Remember when I wasn't even on the reservation Yeah, they charged my credit card on file for a temporary hold FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. After my friend HAD ALREADY PREPAID. They got their before we even stepped in the door, and then double charged a completely different credit card with a completely different name. Yeah, no. You can deal with my credit card company thanks. I'm giving them two stars instead of one because the doormen were so incredibly nice. The nicest I've ever met. They should all get bonuses.And some additional minor points:Doormen: SO NICE! I LOVED THEM!Housekeeping: Good job cleaning WHEN they cleaned (but didn't restock soaps)Pool: Small but really nice, great viewBars: Rude, closed for no reasonFood: GreatBed: ComfortableBathroom: AwesomeNoise level: LOUD but it's not the soundproofing. It's the crazy loud fan/vent.Location: GREATOverall cleanliness: GREATThank you for taking a moment to share your review on TripAdvisor. Your candid feedback is truly valuable.

Our room was very nice and clean, the staff were helpful and friendly, and our view out of the window was of the space needle. The hotel is in a great location with a 2 minute ride on the monorail into Seattle town. Plenty of restaurants and coffee shops and Pike Place Market to wander around."
"4167",4,"The environment starting from the front entrance sets it for the rest of the hotel! They have friendly and knowledgable staff and overall it was the best experience I have had of a hotel. Only thing is, wish they had gym facilities but either than that it was awesome!"
"4168",5,"I have stayed here many times. It is always very clean, friendly, and affordable. Its a pretty new facility but the prices are still low. My favorite thing is that they don't have FOX NEWS on in the lobby so I don't have to listen to hate speech while I get my breakfast."
"4169",3,"Bad: Room was very small and not comftorable for two people. It felt like a third the size of a standard hotel room with just enough space to walk around the bed and a chair in the corner. Bathroom is super small. View from our main floor window was a sketchy back alley with construction. Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street! All in all I feel like this hotel is over priced, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Good: The location of the Charlesmark is great for tourists and people wanting to be in a good spot to transit around but feel safe and enjoy some night life"

"4175",5,"Bad: The fan in our room made a ticking sound throughout the night which was annoying. Also, there are not many choices for food. A couple of flat breads are offered for dinner. Breakfast is more reasonable with pastries, bagels, and fruit. Good: The bed was very comfortable. The space in the room was well used. Very clean.

NOBODY will apologize. This was on my check-card, needless to say it messed up my balance and i couldn't even buy gas to get home!!!!!! It was hard enough with a toddler, funeral and now this!!"
"4181",5,"Our family stayed at the Aria resort and casino for the first time and it was very nice. We had a corner suite in the tower, which provides access to a special room for checking in.

"4182",4,"This hotel is on a well-known avenue and literally across Lake Union. You can see from your hotel room window all of the lake tours available and boats to rent. So many people walking, jogging, and biking around the lake. Make sure you go for a lake view room. Just down the street there are some good places to eat like a BBQ place and Art Mable 21 restaurant. The staff is the best, very helpful and friendly. What I enjoyed the most was their breakfast Acai bowl, so good and an energy boost to start the day right. WiFi is always free and I had no issues.Dear EndyBOSTON,Thank you for sharing your feedback! I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your time at our hotel with the surrounding area being active and upbeat, matching the mood and view of the beautiful Lake Union. The Bistro's Acai Bowls are the best and I'm happy you had a chance to enjoy them at the top of your morning here. We pride ourselves with our staff service and hospitality, so knowing that we were able to take care of our loyal guests, like you, is an absolute delight! Can't wait to have you staying with us again whenever your travels bring you back to Seattle.In hospitality,Alina C."
"4183",5,"The facility is nice and has a great lobby and bar for happy hour events. Enjoyed my stay which was nice and quiet. The renovated rooms were very comfortable."
"4184",3,"I bought a night at this location off of Trip Advisor and I got a really good rate for this area. The bed was awesome I had a really good night sleep. The view of the ocean was very tiny and I was told that if I wanted a better view I'd have to pay more even though there were... More"
"4185",3,"Room was clean and efficient. The efficiency apartment layout was nice. Only critique was the faucet on the bathtub dripped, but i just closed the door and it did not bother me. I was too tired at the end of the workday to bother calling in maintenance. Breakfast is sparse, coffee, instant oatmeal, packaged muffins and some fruit."
"4186",2,"This was def not the worst place I have ever stayed but there was a inch or more gap under the door, pet rooms are on the back side of the hotel next to what could possibly be Tenn, grodiest swimming pool. Highway noise was extremely high and the pool had a malfunction which had it making tons of racket... More"
"4187",5,"Stayed at Club Quarters Downtown in April. I was initially disappointed with the size/layout of my room, so went right back to the front desk to complain (rooms are small but clean and staff is helpful). Virginia, the gal at the desk apologized and instantly moved me to a room with a view of Chicago River. Since it was my first visit to Chicago I asked Virginia about things to do in the area. She inquired about my interests and 10 minutes later I had tickets for Wicked, one of the hottest shows in town, dinner reservations at Vivo, trendy Italian restaurant in the theater district. Next day Virginia suggested a trip to the Art Institute, only a 10 minute walk from the hotel! , walk in Lincoln Park and a very pleasant restaurant for dinner with live jazz . What a great city! I enjoyed my stay tremendously. Will be back, thanks again Virginia!"
"4188",5,"Bad: check-in line was slow. Good: Parking was very convenient, partly because we drove a hybrid and they had special spaces reserved for hybrids."
"4189",3,"Not the quality expected for a Grand Hyatt. Great location to shops, restaurants, beach. Many more children of all ages than expected for this time of year therefore the pool area became less desirable. That was unfortunate because the pool area is certainly one of the main attractions of this hotel. Have stayed here before and do not remember this issue."
"4190",1,"nasty rude man at desk. dark, old, smelly room on back side of motel! Pictures on trip advisor can't be of room 170. Checked in but told them I couldn't stay there. Pool had bugs in it and dirt on the bottom. Room was very dark and very outdated. I didn't feel like I would be able to sleep there.... More"
"4191",5,"Bad: The phone receiver didn't work. And the room wouldn't get as cold as I like. Good: I love my stay at the Westin."
"4192",5,"Great area, very clean and friendly. Traveling for business, would've been nice to have earlier breakfast options."
"4193",4,"This has always been one of our family favorites when it comes to a vacation spot in both the summer and winter. However, the facility and water parks are showing their age and the price to stay just keeps going up. I would recommend a price cut or some major upgrades in the near future before people decide the place... More"
"4194",1,"I traveled a lot and this is the worst hotel I had. Stench until I see a whole wall rotten. Changing room ... Then the new room had flies, living and dead everywhere. The air conditioning was full of dead insects and dust. Bathroom, spiders, caterpillars and Sallete. We disinfected before use."
"4195",5,"We stayed at this Inn for 2 days for a family wedding. The stay was very pleasant and the staff went out of their way to take care of this large party. We came from many states and I believe all were treated very well. Would definitely return to this Inn when back in this area."
"4196",5,"a hidden jewel. extremely nice, comfy, friendly staff and very clean. not what you would expect when you walk inside. Most definitely staying here again next time i am in okc. the rooftop bar was extremely fun-great drinks, food and atmosphere. walking distance to great restaraunts and not far from brick town, okc memorial."
"4197",1,"Bad: I stayed at this hotel for 2 days..they asked me to pay 100 deposit even though I did not know that I had to spit this money before booking the room I finally agreed and in good faith and i paid I was told that the money will be returned back to my account within 7 working daysand so it was done for 1 month and the money I did not get back."
"4198",3,"location is good but an extremely noisy place cannot sleep if u are staying on the lower lever room the rooms on the upper lever all night with people footsteps thudding and u end up being awake so i just felt i wasted spending 395 for 3 NIGHTS with no peace"

"4201",4,"It was great but I usually book places where's there is a complimentary breakfast. I would not stay there again."
"4202",5,"The staff was very friendly and helpful. Great breakfast with lots of options! Overall 10 out of 10. Nice pool and work out area. Clean rooms and hotel with nice updated design. That's all I have to say.Thank you for your good review and we hope to be hosting you again soon here at the Hampton Inn Knoxville/Clinton I-75."
"4203",5,"This is the place to stay if you are visiting the university. Great price if you book online at the discounters' websites! Very friendly, hardworking staff. Informative about the area. I will/would stay there again."
"4204",5,"Location is great for all budget shoppers and easy access to interstates highway. Breakfast was awesome!!"
"4205",2,"Beware when you book online! They show you pictures of main building and facilities. I booked the room fully aware that it is not a oceanfront room and booked a 'west side' and 'room with a view'. It never mentioned anywhere in the description that west side means across the street in a inn like property, completely separate from main building. Room was not good either, with a tiny bath, more like 2 star. And as for 'room with a view', I got a 'nice' view of steps and parking garage 5 feet away from door. Talking to hotel staff was not helpful either as they offered to 'upgrade' me to oceanfront room for an additional 50/ night. The hotel should not be allowed to advertise those rooms as 3 star and put clearly in description what the west side means. Never again!"
"4206",4,"Stayed at the hotel for one night on our last road trip. Found the staff very friendly and helpful. Our only problem is that the hotel is about 10-12 miles outside of Ashland and there are not many restaurants or gas stations around. The staff kindly told us the best places around Ashland and we drove back into the city... More"

"4209",5,"Great place to stay for a few days while visiting Maine."
"4210",3,"I stayed for one night for business. The front desk staff was friendly. Room was clean. Tv worked. Free wifi. Clean shower. Not much more I needed since I was only there to sleep for 6 hours."
"4211",1,"We had no tv service and was told we could move or we could be taken care when we checked out.. we chose to stay in the room as we where unpacked , it was late and we were ready for bed. When we checked out we where then told we had to talk to the manager as we booked thru expedia. It took over week to track the manager down (i left at least three messages on her voicemail). Only to be told that their policy was to move us ... she was rude in her dealing with the situation...thats not what we where told at the time...when I pushed it i was given the option of 10 off my next stay..also ...it was a long weekend and the hotel was busy ... the breakfast area needed attended to...food running out and a little cleaning was in order...the front desk person was friendly and did her best to replenish and a very bus time for her at the desk...when i asked housekeeping for a new ice bucket (as ours had a crack in it and was leaking) she rolled her eyes at me and sighed like i was putting her out... this hotel could use some renovatons and attention in order to be up to Ramada standard. P.S. I fly alot and have used this hotel at least 3 or 4 times .... there will not be another stay there. and not recommending it."
"4212",4,"Hourly shuttle service to the airport. Very reasonable. Room was large, clean and comfortable. Return shuttle service took a little bit of a wait."
"4213",3,"peeling lamp shades, broken off extra safety door lock. Other wise clean and sufficient for our need"
"4214",4,"I thought the hotel was beautiful from Miami like bar to the indoor pool and Jacuzzi to the Cooked-to -Order buffet breakfast. The prices weren't bad except for the 50 incidental hold they add to ur credit card. And the room should come with free wi fi. I mean they need to get with it. Even motel 6 offers that for free. But outside of that. Great service."
"4215",4,"I was VERY nervous about choosing this hotel because of the negative reviews. But we were pleasantly surprised! A group of friends and I (girls, early 20s) stayed here on Saturday 12/28 and our total room cost was 115. We chose Rodeway because it was only a mile away from Bader Field where Life in Color was. The rooms were very clean! Outdated, but clean. Beds were actually pretty comfortable! Didn't use the TV. The bathrooms were also very clean. The shower's water pressure wasn't the best, but we dealt with it. Check in and check out went very quickly and smoothly. Not the friendliest people, but they got the job done. We found a place to park right outside of our room which was great. Parking is 10 which is annoying but you have to pay to park ANYWHERE in Atlantic City so I didn't mind. Anything beats paying 700 a night at Revel (that was their rate on the same night!!!). We were barely in our room all night, so this hotel is perfect for a group of friends who are just looking for a place to shower, pregame, and sleep. I wouldn't recommend this place to a couple only because it's not really romantic or anything. It's very basic, which is what we were looking for. There is a free breakfast but of course we didn't wake up early enough (ends at 10), however there was still fresh, hot coffee at 12pm when we checked out which was nice. This place is definitely NOT a 5-star hotel, but it's also not bad either. And no, we didn't see any hookers!"
"4216",5,"This is our second time to stay at the Aria. My husband and I love this hotel. Not a lot of horrible traffic through the resort like you have at some of the other hotels. Very laid back and very elegant. Great place to stay if you want to avoid a lot of children. Loved all of the extra amenities... More"

Got home and had forgotten part of a cord that I needed. called them and they found it. They were very helpful and I drove... More"
"4218",4,"I must say that the hotel met my standards of comfort, space but cleanliness was not so good. The housekeeping staff must be retrained and maybe the hotel should hire dedicated people to clean rooms thoroughly. I found 2 bags of trash in the cabinet from previous tenants (SURPRISED FACE)and the shower curtain was in poor condition. This discovery made me feel that the hotel staff zips in and out rooms, and not cleaning properly."

Also, right... More"
"4222",4,"nice people, newer decor, good sleep, nice ride to airport.... (the only reason 4 stars was the breakfast could have had hot foods--like eggs--that would be a five star)"
"4223",3,"The hotel is in a good convenient area. It was clean. I made a reservation for 2 nights and they neglected to tell me that the check out time was 11am. I decided to check out before the next day after 11 and the lady at the front desk was very rude and said that ""SHE TOLD ME"" the check out time. I explained to her that she did not tell me the check out time and she would not refund my bill for the 2nd day."
"4224",2,"This was the most reasonably priced hotel. It is understaffed to say the least. Night desk clerk did not charge me for a roll away I needed for 1 night. This is where the good news ends. Each day we had to ask for something that should have been in our room, towels, shampoo etc. Our last night there, we stood in a long line to ask for the cups that were not replaced during housekeeping. I was given the address to Wal-mart to go and buy my own! During breakfast they ran out of spoons, cereal was eaten with a fork. I wish management would train and hire additional employees for better customer service!"
"4225",5,"Bad: The price of the wifi. Good: Everything"
"4226",5,"Really nice room...comfortable king bed, great ocean view from balcony on 5th floor. Bathroom was little tight to go in shut door. Love the afternoonsunshine coming in through glassed-in hallway leading to rooms. Access to boardwalk beach was quick easy. The breakfast was way more than continental delish. Price was decent since it was off-season, that's when we choose to stay overnight most anywhere. We would def stay there again!"

"4230",3,"Hotel not well maintained. Lack of staffing. Missing ceiling tiles in hallways, lights out, cleaning staff does only what they have too. No maintenance staff on site. 1st room we had bath fan sounded like it was going to fall apart, room had dirt in corners and behind curtains. 2nd room we had: toilet was loose and rocked, air conditioner had mildew around the sides. Walls in hotel are thin can hear people next door and above. Parking lot not paved."
"4231",5,"Everything was very good, but pool looked bigger in the pictures and controlling the room temperature to be comfortable."
"4232",4,"Having tried 3 other hotels locally I wanted something nicer. I arrived at 7pm and received a warm welcome from Bob. With drinks and a snack meal available I was able to relax without having to sit in another restaurant. Bob was a good host taking care of guests as they arrived and looking after others in the lounge. I... More"
"4233",5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the ARIA. The service, the room and the conference area were great. The room was spacious and very comfortable. I really like that everything was controlled by the tablet in the room. I will stay at the ARIA again when visiting Las Vegas."
"4234",5,"We stayed here for one night on our way back home from a vacation. It was a wonderful experience. We got the King Suite with a Jacuzzi in the corner of the room. Everything about the stay was super. It was close to restaurants for dining and they served breakfast early so we could get back on the road."
"4235",4,"when i saw the neighborhood i wasn't exactly sure. there are some brand new places/hotels nearby, but there are also some very run down places nearby also. all worked out very well for our stay however and everyone at the hotel was nice, the place was clean, and despite appearances there wasn't any trouble and we felt safe where we were"
"4236",2,"We've been coming to the Aria Hotel since its grand opening. It's a lovely hotel, but like every hotel in Las Vegas it's highly used. Bedspreads on this visit had questionable stains on them, not freshly replace for our visit. Black mold in the shower area, gross! One of the three pools has changed, they charge 100.00 for lounge chairs... More"
"4237",3,"I did not stay in the room a whole lot as I was in town for a conference. My husband, however, came with me and spent most of the day in the room while I was at my conference. He was not impressed with the wifi strength, intermittent moments of loud guests and lack of a microwave in the room. Other than that we were pleased with the comfort of the room in general."
"4238",5,"Hotel provides a list of restaurants nearby. this has nothing to do with the hotel, but be wary of delivery in this area, the food pretty much sucks - at least the chinese and pizza. The hotel is awesome. Shuttle will take you anywhere you need to go nearby. Hotel was service was spot on. Loved my room. Cannot go wrong with Hyatt Place. Clean, Comfy, spacious, reasonably priced. Highest recommendation."
"4239",5,"The staff was so kind, everywhere was so clean, and good location"

"4245",4,"I was looking for a (relatively) inexpensive place to stay for a week long course. The hotel was conveniently located for me. It has excellent beach access. Rooms are small with some inconveniences, but adequate. Parking spaces are way too narrow. You can park entirely within the marked lines and still have trouble getting into and out of your car. Overall it met my needs, and I would certainly consider staying there again."
"4246",4,"Bad: Internet connection not great from my room. Good: Quiet and great bed... But room a bit dark and no view. Super service and boutique feeling to everything."
"4247",5,"Good: Facilities were great. Bar and games/activity room. Good bar food also. Very comfortable, great staff."

"4254",4,"Embassy Suites as a chain is great. Who else offers the manager special and great breakfast buffet that, to us, is the hallmark of their hotel. However, I was disappointed with the service in Linthicum, MD during our stay. I did not feel the front desk was friendly or had smiles. I hate dealing with customer service that you feel you are inconveniencing. If you have kids that stay with you on the fold-out couch, they never have extra bedding in the room, if you want to make up the bed. We asked the front desk for the extra bedding. It wasn't provided. We called housekeeping. No answer. We called the desk, and eventually housekeeping brought up extra towels. Eventually, housekeeping brought up some bedding with a repeat call to the desk. The next morning their was no receipt on the floor by your door like most hotels. Because we didn't just wanted to go in the morning, after our yummy breakfast (during which mindful busboys kept our table clear of extra, now emptied dishes), we just wanted to pack up and leave without stopping by the desk. This was probably a big mistake, because I found out the next weekend, that the Linthicum charged us for the room on top of what I already paid hotels.com. That was incredibly annoying. What if never had checked my account. Could this have happened at another time, at one of their other locations Thankfully, a call to the polite desk supervisor took care of it for us. We're supposed to get a credit in a few days."
"4255",3,"pool needs cleaning , ring around the pool"
"4256",5,"Had a great time"
"4257",4,"Bathrooms need renovating. Were not on par with rest of room. My shower/tub did not drain, at all, and water was up past my ankles by the time I finished showering. Every staff person I encountered was exceptionally helpful, polite, and friendly. Rooms were a nice size and had nice amenities."
"4258",2,"This hotel was newly renovated, which made me expect something better. The room smelled awful, and there were dead crickets on our bathroom floor. The decor had in the room had in fact been updated. The bathroom had old tiles old tub old toilet with a new vanity top and mirror. Everything else was obviously old. Our black out curtains were held together with paper clips, we could hear EVERYTHING going on in the room next to us, the hallway, and upstairs! When any doors would shut, our room would loudly vibrate. Our check in clerk was very nice and she tried to help us with anything we needed... Also, no elevator and my parents who are elder, were placed upstairs, making it hard to get them and their luggage to their room! This simply was an emergency place to sleep, but I clearly overpaid, because it was no better than Motel 6 (and it was double the price)"
"4259",5,"Room was very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a plus and good. Close to highways (only 20 minutes from DC attractions. Nearby to shopping and local restaurants. The Silver Diner nearby was excellent."
"4260",3,"Staff is friendly and helpful.great location, not enough parking. Parking garage is really tight for large vehicles. Heated indoor pool was cold. Beds are small, not very comfortable, pillows are terrible. Food in the restaurant is good but continental breakfast wasnt good at all."
"4261",3,"Average hotel for decent price. It was balanced. Housekeeping did leave our door only ajar after cleaning one day. Arrrggghhhh!!!!! Nothing was missing."
"4262",4,"Awesome service. Clean appealing room. Very spacious. Breakfast of hot food was excellant. Amazing location. I highlt recommwnd this hitel to anyone teavelung to pittsburgh. Very close to metro, sports stadiums, bars and dininf."
"4263",5,"Bad: Everything was great. In the future the bathroom could use an update. Good: Great location only a minute away from the beach, room cleaning every day and well working WiFi."
"4264",2,"Room smelled musty. No elevator, and very second rate breakfast. Definitely not worth the price."
"4265",3,"Our stay was ok-if the bathroom sink had drained and they had mattresses that didn't sink real bad, the place would be great for the money."
"4266",1,"We stayed here for 2 nights, and we chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on hotels.com. Unfortunately, the hotel was not what I expected. It was not clean, and was very run-down and dated. The front desk staff members were not pleasant, and one of them was downright rude. Their free breakfast was definitely a disappointment, as it was lacking in quality. I suppose since it was free, there's not much that I can complain about. The food was tasteless, there wasn't enough on hand for all of the guests (except for the cereal) and the breakfast area was very dirty. I would not stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else."

And I clean home for a living and the bath room needs really down to using a tooth brush around the tub and floor, and I took the empty toilet paper roll out to put in the new one and the dirt I saw behind that empty roll was bad I left it out so the house keeper would see the dirt and what ever else was in there.

"4273",1,"I was traveling in February 2015, was tired and stopped at this terrible place. The front desk lady was very kind and quite understanding when I requested my money back. The room was full of roaches, E V E R Y W H E R E! Left running, kept driving."
"4274",4,"I have stayed here a few times for business. It is a good location with lots of options for retail shopping and dining. The hotel is clean and the breakfast is good with fresh fruit and hot eggs in addition to standard fare. King of Prussia Mall is right across the street."
"4275",3,"This hotel is located across the river from the Trump Hotel which makes it walkable to Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and possibly even Navy Pier. Rooms are nice, sleek and clean but SMALL. How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a late checkout Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it Well, this hotel charges 35 for late checkout! We had a situation, where my mom, a senior, was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing. We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and didn't return to our room until 3:00 am. When we woke at 11:00 am, we were hoping they'd allow us a late check out so we'd have time to get some food, especially since she is diabetic. The hotel would make no exception or allowance. We had to hurry and pack. We'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up. Because of this insensitivity I've had to lower the rating of the hotel."
"4276",2,"Nice staff, room almost too small to turn around in. Kind of dirty feeling, bed should've been replaced five years ago. Can hear every noise next door and in the hall."
"4277",5,"Very impressive stay. Friendly and efficient staff. Great complimentary breakfast in a lovely dining area. A surprise complimentary cocktail hour in the evenings....wine, beer, cheese and crackers....even cookies for the sweet tooth. Unexpectedly 5 star weekend for us!"
"4278",2,"The ac unit was broke in the room so we were forced to open the back door and listen to the highway noise all night. Bed sheets were stained and room maintenance needed done witb broken outlets, lamp shades, etc."
"4279",5,"A great experience at this hotel. I will stay there again."
"4280",3,"The hotel staff are super friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast is also very good. Apart from the usual cold fare, the hot part included scrambled egg, home fries, and one other item (bacon or sausage or biscuit/gravy) during our stay. But that's where the positives end. The hotel condition is pretty bad. Rooms, elevators and all other common areas need major renovation. Many small issues existed in our room to name a few - the faucet head was broken, the hooks in the bathroom were missing, the phone was not working, the in-room lighting was poor (probably the darkest hotel room in my experience and I travel a lot). Oh, I forgot to mention one other positive - the free shuttle van to nearby places including the metro station. All in all, it's a ok hotel if you are a student or in a tight budget. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
"4281",4,"We just returned from a week long stay at the Americana. If you want fancy don't stay here, but we had no complaints. The breakfast in the morning was fine for us, a bagel and juice, a roll or muffin and coffee, a piece of fruit it was good. The rooms were clean, yes, it's an older motel, but it... More"
"4282",2,"Clean room. No frills."

"4284",5,"I stayed a Staybridge Suites Lincoln North for a month while my new house was being completed. That is a long time to be in a hotel with two dogs who are used to having their own backyard.

The staff is wonderful, willing to help with anything they can to make your stay here awesome. The pool is crystal clear and the hot tub is at the perfect tempature.

"4288",1,"My girlfriends and I booked the sheraton for our weekend trip to Miami.. The hotel did not get our booking correct, we were not give a balcony room although we had booked one. They would not accommodate our requests to move to a balcony room and stated the entire hotel was sold out, so we sucked it up and went to the standard double room. Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good. I'd spend a little bit more of the money and stay elsewhere."
"4289",5,"Excellence in customer service, rooms and the breakfast provided! Everything is done with such quality and kindness! We occupied 7 hotel rooms while attending a family Thanksgiving. It was unanimous everyone loved the hotel! Thank you Hampton!"
"4290",4,"We stayed in Room 1 of the carriage house which was cozy, quaint, and comfortable. Sitting on the porch offered a lovely view. Bass Harbor is off the beaten track much quieter than Bar Harbor, which is what we were looking for. Although we didn't stay in a cottage, they are quite large, with a kitchenette and several bedrooms.... More"
"4291",5,"This hotel combines historic character with great location in Lahaina. The room was comfortable, with outdoor balcony to enjoy as well with views of courtyard and harbor beyond.

"4295",5,"We returned to HK for our 4th year and tried this unit. It was on the other side of the property but still with an internal view.

"4297",1,"I have stayed at many Ramada's over the years. This location was very run down. Carpet was soiled and dated. Had to call front desk for a TV remote and then get it ourselves. Continental breakfast was sadly lacking. Even the batter for the Waffles seemed watered down."
"4298",5,"We spent one night at he Drury Plaza hotel and will definitely be returning the next time we are in St. Louis! The room was spacious and comfortable, the hot breakfast buffet was delicious, and you even get a voucher for a free drink at happy hour. The hotel is also within walking distance of the arch and ballpark village.... More"

First floor rooms are almost subterranean so be carefull if booking them. The motel looks over a golf course in the back, so open the backdoor and enjoy a gorgeous cross breeze. Staff is incredibly friendly, happy... More"
"4303",2,"We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience."
"4304",4,"The Best Western Inn at Napa was a very comfortable place to stay. The room was a very decent size and had good amenities. Parking was free and it was in a good location to be able to explore Napa, although admittedly not in the most picturesque part of the valley. A very solid choice if you want a slightly cheaper option and don't mind not staying in a farmhouse!Thank you for your review. We are glad you enjoyed your stay."
"4305",3,"I stayed there with our team. Beds were average. Shower was good. Housekeeping staff seemed OK. We stayed with our team. All of the staff didn't know that we are staying there and we need separate room too eat etc. So we ended up in lobby eating dinner etc. Breakfast was decent and the room was always setup.

I don't care for having the sink outside the bathroom, but that's a personal preference. The light over the sink is really strong, which is hard on others in the room. The bed and the... More"
"4307",1,"This place is a dump. The rooms are not clean. The beds are smaller than a normal double bed. The sheets and blankets have cigarette burns in them. The mattress in my room had been torn open with the springs exposed. The rooms all have terrible perfume smell. Only a few channels on the TV work, some don't have sound. The ice machine was full of mold. The overall area that the hotel is in a bad place. When the police are constantly outside in the parking lot it's a sign not to stay there."
"4308",5,"Always good service and perfect ambiance"
"4309",4,"Located right in the heart of historic Lahaina, you can't get a more convenient hotel for the price. It's a lovely historic hotel, very clean and well cared for.

"4313",5,"Good: Loved location and decor."
"4314",2,"This seems like a great value when compared with other area hotels, but it's worth the extra drive to Spokane Valley or Coeur d'alene. The rooms are large, but very dark and old. It smells old and musty. There seemed to be plenty for the kids to do though a swimming pool, arcade, etc. The night staff was friendly, but... More"
"4315",3,"The room smelled horrible...like stale cigarette smoke and mold. Other than the smell, they gave me the handicapped room with a shower that floods the floor. Besides these 2 things, the room was fine. I will never stay here again."

"4317",5,"Bad: No soap available, just shower gel. No hot water for three days. Good: Super room 10 on third floor. Loved the squishy soft duvet. Excellent staff tried very hard to help us with many things. Even had help signing up to Uber for the first time! Made good use of the pool."
"4318",5,"Good: I loved everything"
"4319",4,"Nice hotel and friendly staff"
"4320",3,"Location, Location, Location.... yes. But facility definately showing aging. Parking should be included in the cost of stay. It is kind of like saying rooms are $/ night, but you have to pay to use the toilet. But with that said location could not be better."
"4321",2,"I was verry disAppointed. With the house keeping service, no towels, bed wasn't done cause we left a a pant on the bed, no cofffe......i hated.....i hate to ask for everything when is suppose to be done w out asking"

"4325",4,"Great restful and roomy. Pet fee was way too much. Will cause us not to stay there. Sad. Really enjoyed the service staff. Breakfast was great."
"4326",4,"This hotel serves its purpose. We stayed here when visiting Phoenix for spring training. Most hotels were booked and very expensive. This was a bit out of the way but worth the savings. Room was updated and clean. Fabian at the front desk was great!"
"4327",4,"This was a good stopping point with our two kids. Breakfast and wifi were good. The desk clerk enrolled us in the rewards program when they heard we'd be staying in a BW hotel twice more in the next year. Corridors a bit dated but everything worked. We would definitely use this hotel again."
"4328",4,"It was a wonderful stay however for some reason money was transferred out of my bank account towards this hotel for 86 and nobody knew why which was disappointing. However, the stay was great."
"4329",5,"Bad: The prices of the SPA treatment are quite expensive. If you go to most expensive SPA in Dubai the treatment can varies between USD 120 for normal facial cleansing up to USD 500 or 600 for a full package of 4 hours . Yet here the minimum starts at USD 280/- excluding the taxes ! . Good: What not to like about this property !!! Everything was great. The location, the spacious rooms the view the room service the in room dining the restaurants even the Spa. Ok I didn't try the spa due to my busy schedule but it looked so good (although the prices of the treatments were quite expensive). Some people thing that the hotel is a bit expensive, well it is located in one of the most prestigious and expensive districts in LA. It is just located on the famous Rodeo Drive. The rooms were big. I advise you to not take the room with balconies if you know your self won't use it. The balcony takes space out of the room. My most concerns and worries normally in any hotel is the cleanness of the bathroom and toilets and here it was just perfect."
"4330",3,"Tub needed work but was clean. Lounge chair had broken leg."
"4331",5,"Nice place all around with great amenities, good breakfast, nice staff. For some reason though, at night the hotel smelled like sewage. Really. Also, my credit card pending charge is 90 more than my checkout receipt."
"4332",5,"Great location and wonderful service"
"4333",5,"Excellent connecting condos for our large group. We did not choose to use the the local amenities, but it was close to the volleyball center which was our purpose of travel. The hotel staff was welcoming and easy to work with when reserving our group rooms."
"4334",1,"When I brought photos of dried vomit to the front desk they were dismissive. They asked if the sheets were dirty or stained. Need I say more. Sticky stuff on nightstand. Security guards on the floors and security cameras everywhere. Especially as young women, be safe and stay somewhere else."
"4335",5,"Easily accessible to highways shopping. Since I've stayed in this area before I will definitely stay here again."
"4336",5,"Good: It was a great holiday, staff were very helpful. Comfortable rooms and breakfast on the floor was a great idea."

Back down to the desk for new ones 2x, hotel steamer used for getting wrinkles out of black tie suit/ gown was overfilled w/ water and puddled in the room,... But staff responded quickly/ apologetically. Nice indoor/ outdoor space for complimentary breakfast and appetizers in am/ pm. Great location kitty corner to Chelsea Market, near Highline Park, Chelsea Pier"
"4338",5,"Bad: Overbooked, could not get additional night. Good: Nice accomodations."
"4339",5,"Bad: Everything was great. Good: The staff was very helpful and efficient."
"4340",3,"Hotel staff were very nice! Room appearance was nice, but I could tell that someone had smoked in the room. Other than that it's not a bad place to stay for a night."
"4341",5,"This was a great experience! The staff is amazing.They were always wiling to help, friendly and professional. The breakfast staff was eager to help meet all dietary needs. The rooms were clean and attended to regularly. Parking was plentiful and the hotels proximity to local amenities is convenient."
"4342",5,"Very dubious about our stay here as had read very mixed reviews. The hotel is situated in a commercial/industrial area, so is very quiet in the evenings.

"4346",3,"Our experiences with the staff at the hotel were great, everyone was very friendly. The room itself was okay. Nothing very exciting, but it had what we needed. It felt a bit worn out. There was a crack in the shower wall. The safe in the room was quite hard to open because the lock itself was worn. The door to the balcony was hard to lock unlock for the same reason, the AC was very loud, but it did keep us nice cool. The pillows on the bed were strange, instead of your normal sized pillows they were all about the size of a couch throw pillow (about 4-5 on a bed) they were very thick roundish. Too hard on the neck! The location was terrific though it was nice to have a free breakfast every morning. The breakfast bar included juices, tea, coffee milk. There was cereal, French toast, grits, sausage, eggs, pastries, fruit, yogurt, toast, English muffins, etc. You won't go away hungry:) The indoor pool was like a sauna. A bit too warm for us. The outdoor pool is very nice just across the room. There is parking right in front of the hotel or across the street in back of the outdoor pool. It is in walking distance of shops restaurants. It's also about an hour away from Busch Gardens. There is a great ice cream place right across from the hotel called 'Sweet Frog'. Awesome, but a bit on the expensive side. A great treat though. The best thing is the beach so it is well worth it to get an Oceanside balcony."
"4347",4,"Better than expected for the price point. The breakfast that was provided offered many choices."
"4348",4,"We stopped at this hotel on our way from Colorado to California. We stayed on July 4th. We predominantly stay at Best Westerns to gain the bonus points.

"4352",4,"The Breakfast staff were beyond wonderful. The Front Desk staff were always helpful and friendly. However, I did have an issue with closing charges that were applied to the card I used as a GTD only, resulting in a credit that seems to be taking forever. The hotel overall was always clean and well maintained. Elevators could have been built a little bigger!"
"4353",4,"This hotel was really nice, but it has very poor signage and is right up against another hotel. The wifi was poor and the breakfast was horrible. I ended up buying breakfast foods at walmart and ate in my room. The room and the interior of the hotel was excellent. Very clean, and quiet. Bring your own pillow though if... More"

There was people outside drinking alcohol and being loud despite the 40 degree weather with rain. The stairway up to the 3rd floor smelled like urine. Strongly recommend to pay the extra money and stay at a different hotel. Would not take family here."

"4361",5,"My stay was surprisingly wonderful, except they didn't mention any charges at check in after the bill was paid for ahead of time. If they're going to charge customers after they've already paid ahead of time, then they should at least give the customer the common decency and respect to advise them of such action. People don't like surprise charges and no legit reasons."
"4362",5,"Extremely pleased with our hotel stay. We are a family of 5 and recently spent 2 nights at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of our suite and the friendliness of the staff. There is a popcorn machine in the lobby, which my kids loved. We also caught the staff setting out warm chocolate chip cookies in the evenings-YUM! Such a nice homey touch! The free breakfast was outstanding. We traditionally don't expect much from a hotel spread, but this one was the exception. Lots of selections, and the hot options changed from one morning to the next. Breakfast attendant was friendly and helpful, and kept everything well stocked as the crowd ebbed and flowed. The only negatives were an extremely loud family in the room above us that kept us awake until almost midnight. The hotel staff did they best to help and even offered to move us, but we opted not to take them up on the offer. Nothing else the staff could have done to help that situation. I was also disappointed that the hot tub wasn't working, but the kids had a wonderful time in the pool regardless."
"4363",1,"Thought from reviewing this hotel that it was a winner! We got there and the room was awful!! it was in need of a facelift! And the square footage was smaller than advertised. A real downer and the front desk team was not helpful at all."

Only slight criticism is the rooms could be bigger. But they are very clean and well maintained with one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in. Wifi is free if you are staying there - just ask... More"
"4380",5,"love them!! everyone is super nice. never have we had any issues with our booking or our room. good location. had a problem with our car and had to leave it there for a week and they were nice enough to let us keep it there while we figured out how to get it back home lol"
"4381",3,"Bad: My money was stolen at the valet... room was dirty and had to get another then key card didn't work for new room. Manager did his best but I was disappointed. Good: Location"
"4382",4,"excellant breakfast - great cookies in the afternoon-friendly staff and very clean Only compliant was that other guests were banging their doors very early in the morning and staff scraping sidewalk with shovel very early"
"4383",4,"Good: Boutique type hotel. With At Home Feeling. Nice atmosphere for the price!"
"4384",4,"This is our second family reunion there and both times were wonderful. It was peaceful and beautiful. The courtyard had barbecue pits and the condos were well stocked. We sat on the patio most of the time and just visited. A marvelous place to stay when in a group. A little pricey but still a good time. Just off the... More"
"4385",2,"We have stayed at this hotel several other times and it has not improved. There are not many in the area and a football game at Penn State that weekend filled those up and raised the price quickly. This hotel is old, run down and lacks many amenities, but we slept there only and were gone during the days for... More"
"4386",2,"Upon check in I specifically asked the hours for breakfast the next morning and was told it went until10am. Well at 9:30 my two children and I went down and discovered there was really not much there to eat. I proceeded to attempt to make a waffle and the worker in charge of breakfast rudely snapped at me that I... More"
"4387",4,"We enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and pleasant. The bed was comfortable. Although not a great deal of selection, the breakfast was good and sufficient. It was obvious that the owner wanted us to be comfortable and that resulted in us being comfortable. We appreciated it."
"4388",5,"We were in Cedar Rapids for an event at the convention center, and I originally had made a reservation at the adjoining Double Tree. However, my wife searched on Hotels.com and instead booked a room at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel in order to save almost 100. It was a good choice. The Best Western is located just off I-380 and was only a short jaunt (.5 miles) to the convention center. While there was a bit of a funky smell in the first floor hallway, our room on the second floor was large and clean (my wife in particular noted how immaculately clean the bathroom was). We had a microwave and refrigerator in our room, and we also used the free WiFi. The indoor swimming pool was also on the 2nd floor, although we did not have time to take a dip on this trip. There is a bar and restaurant that adjoins the hotel, and we took advantage of their 1.25 frosty mug special (daily until 6 pm). As the event that brought us to town kept us up quite a bit later than our usual bedtime, we were glad for the noon check-out time. We would definitely stay again at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel the next time we overnight in Cedar Rapids."
"4389",4,"The hotel staff was the best ! Very helpful and friendly. Room needed some updates though could work through it for our one night stay."
"4390",4,"The Aloft came as advertised. It was more modern than the pictures on their website might lead you to believe. Green option was good, they do not refresh unless you ask them to. Nice bar with pretty good food in the hotel. 15 minutes or so to walk to the river and French Quarter. Staff were friendly and accomodating.Yay! We love when we exceed your expectations and thank you for letting us know. Appreciate the kind words and we look forward to seeing you back at Aloft New Orleans Downtown."
"4391",5,"My wife and I spent our first anniversary here and loved it! The staff was incredibly kind and everything was clean and more than comfortable! It was only 45 minutes from Asheville so we spend the day in the city then drove back up in the evening. Cozy and warm, this place was amazing!"
"4392",4,"We stayed at the Redwood when we were looking for a reasonably priced motel for the SuperBowl weekend. (It is quite a ways from the Super Bowl site.) Considering the price, the Redwood was a good motel and was very clean. It's older, but managment seems to be working hard to maintain a reasonble place to stay."
"4393",5,"I stayed here for an evening during a recruiting trip to the area. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with anything I needed. They allowed me an early check-in and the rooms were clean and modern. I really liked the lobby and its couches and chairs gave a homey and comfortable vibe to the hotel."
"4394",3,"While traveling with 3 small kids, we booked this room for a quick stopover on a drive from Colorado to Iowa. It is right off Interstate 80 and could not be easier to find. All rooms are accessed from the outside - something to keep in mind. Everyting was clean and orderly, and the beds and pillows were very comfortable.... More"
"4395",4,"Very nice staff. (They must have fired all the the rude people I read about in the reviews. LOL) Safe area (for New Orleans. For the people who said it was in a bad neighborhood, this is not Mayberry. ) The cost was a bit excessive in my opinion. Over 250 for one night ( although that did include parking. and it was an event weekend.) The facilities are nice. You can sit on the wrought iron balcony and watch the French Quarter wake up. The location is convenient and close to everything. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that the shower was dirty. For that kind of money, I at least want to wash my old behind in a clean shower. The bed was VERY FIRM. It was too firm for my wife and me, but I hear some people like firm mattresses, so this would be right up your ally if you do. The second floor seems to be the best as far as views, I think. Third floor could be a beating on older folks because of the stairs. Also, there are two seperate hotels. I saw where a lady was complaining about having to walk from the office to another building. This is because she went to the wrong one, initially. There is French Quarter Suites, and New Orleans Courtyard Hotel. I think the NO Courtyard is a little higher end. Overall good experience. I will be back, but not on an event weekend."
"4396",5,"Very helpful and friendly staff, who upgraded the room, even though they could not see from their notes that it should accomodate 5 persons. They also gave very good advice regarding restaurants and nearby attractions like Six Flags in LA county. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The breakfast room was also very tidy and had plenty of space. There as also a nice pool there (which we did not make use of). Very good value for money. It also had a convenient location for us, close to Camarillo's attractions as well as other places within driving distance, like for example LA, Santa Barbara, Malibu and Solvang. The business room was also very useful, and things were in order."
"4397",5,"Wonderful hotel with excellent views of the city cleanliness and service exceptional overall a world class standards hotel,(my girlfriend loved). The only thing I would like to suggest is to bring your own mouth wash."
"4398",4,"Nice hotel and a weird location, really not near anything. They d ok have a bar and small restaurant. Comfortable hotel, was clean and nice staff. I would stay here again. Good value for the area. It was also very quiet here."
"4399",4,"Bad: Breakfast."
"4400",3,"The hotel was apparently renovated about 10 or 15 years ago, but hasn't been very well maintained since then. The condition of the rooms is clean but run-down. The attached restaurant serves pretty decent Indian food. The biggest complaint is that there was a plumbing issue with the hot water not running in the shower. The second is that the check in process was excruciatingly slow. I don't know if I'd stay there again, given the plethora of other inexpensive hotels in the area. If you do stay there, check all of the amenities in the room and insist on a different room if something doesn't work."
"4401",5,"I travel a lot with my job, so I'm constantly staying at hotels. When my co-workers and I arrived late last night at the Aloft the people at the front desk were more than welcoming. When I wanted to order room service I was told it was too late however, Olivia at the front desk informed me of a Italian... More"
"4402",4,"I had a project in the area which took more than a year. I also stayed at the Comfort Inn and the HI Express. They're all pretty much the same to me. Rates change over time, so I stayed at the Hawthorn Suites when they had the best price of the three. The rooms are nice, clean, and quiet. Plenty... More"
"4403",5,"Really great hotel, good breakfast buffet and I loved the fact they had a stairway going down to the beach area... And the view of the Ocean was fantastic. The only unfortunate thing was the weather wasn't in our favor to enjoy the hot tub and fire pits. I'll be back"
"4404",4,"We arrived around noon and check-in was not until 4 pm and they gave us room immediately. The room was very large and clean with a balcony. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I am a member of the Gold Crown Club for Best Western and I have been very pleased with the hotels and the prices. Nice to have a Denny's on the property also. I would definately stay there again if ever in the area.We are glad we were able to check you in early. We apprieciate you being a Rewards Member! Membership has its perks. As you know early check ins, late check outs and even free room upgrades when available. We have also just started a full free hot breakfast in the newly remodeled Denny's on our property. Hope to see you on your 2nd trip to Napa."
"4405",5,"Great central location, close to City Place and all the restaurants and shopping. Fast checkin process. The front desk staff was extremely accommodating in helping me get some work done while I was there. They went above and beyond what I expected. Definitely would stay here again!"
"4406",1,"The carpet was so dirty that we had to where socks and still clean our feet. The Sheets for the bed felt like sandpaper and the shower never gave hot water. Cannot recommend staying here to anyone."
"4407",5,"I am a Hilton Diamond member and this is one of the best Hamptons I have stayed in for quite some time. The staff was wonderful and the hotel was very comfortable and not run down. The breakfast was plentiful and there was a good variety of items to choose from."
"4408",3,"Traveling on business. Check in was horrible. Not very polite at all. Nor very friendly. I specifically asked for a non smoking room. The put me into a smoking room with a ash tray on the table in the room. There was burn holes, dog hairs on the bed spread. I was very upset at this point. So I stripped... More"
"4409",3,"The room was spacious. They have a breakfast restaurant and bar. No dinner facilities. There are plenty of good restaurants in the neighborhood. Staff is very efficient, helpful and friendly. Good location and parking. Worth checking this place out"
"4410",2,"Not great - Construction is important but changing the lobby is not the most important reason. Rooms are more important. I would skip this Hotel until the construction is finished. I was not impressed to stay here."
"4411",5,"I was surprised when I arrived at this hotel. The staff are all very nice and helpful. The hotel is easy to find and is very close to the downtown area and sports arenas. The hotel has a nice restaurant and a nice sports bar. My hotel room was clean and seemed to have been recently updated."
"4412",3,"Opted to stay here and commute to downtown for my meetings to save on hotel expenses of the downtown hotels. If you are willing to do that, it works. hotel has basic amenities, nothing more. It's basically a highrise motel...rooms are all suites with stove, microwave,etc. 10-15 minute walk to metro. Shuttle operates only on weekdays."
"4413",3,"Nice hotel, but not enough people working there, which made check-in a drawn-out experience."
"4414",5,"We picked this hotel out of convenience and the fact that it had a pool close to the Punta Gorda airport. We had one of the best evenings hanging out at the tiki bar next-door, around the pool with our kids, and at the hotel bar that night. Everyone was super friendly, hotel room was very clean and unique compared... More"
"4415",4,"I really do love staying at Aria! It's very nice, centrally located on the strip, and the service is great, however the last three times I've been there, there's been one or more issues that I've had to call about. From equipment not working, to being checked into an already occupied room, to maid service not being completed. The hotel... More"
"4416",4,"The hotel is very clean and the only problem we had was the TV would not reach a volume that we could hear. I asked the desk about how to turn it up and was told it was low volume so it would not disturb others. We could not hear it at all. We do not usually have it loud... More"
"4417",4,"This Residence Inn is kind of out of no where - it's pretty far from the center of city and has lots developments in the area. That being said, there are good restaurants/coffeeshops around within 3-5 mins drive. Their price for the room in summer is GREAT! Not sure if I would pay for what they ask for in spring though.Dear Jui-Yu C,Thank you for choosing the Residence Inn Phoenix North/Happy Valley for your recent travels to Phoenix. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay.

"4418",5,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights over the 4th of July weekend. We needed a relaxing break from the trauma in our lives since October. Deer Crest really helped us achieve our goal. We had a river front king room which had the most comfortable bed. Room was kept very clean by the very nice housekeeping staff.... More"
"4419",5,"This was a very beautiful hotel. The rooms were small but clean and quaint. The hotel was located within walking distance from the saturday market and other downtown activities. We had desert in the hotel bar and it was delicious."
"4420",5,"Spent the night here with spouse. Check-in was friendly and fast. Free parking if you have a car and free airport shuttle if you fly. Rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. Very comfortable beds with nice linens. Bath amenities in shower are in dispensers. Soap bars at sink. Great shower head! Single-serve coffee maker, hair dryer, free long distance calls... More"
"4421",5,"Good location to highway- easy to get around if you leave before 6am. The breakfast made my day, and the coffee is worth taking a to go cup. People are always at the pool- which is family oriented. The staff is helpful and they have cookies in the evenings."
"4422",5,"We stayed for three nights at the West Street hotel after experiencing two disappointing nights at another hotel. The staff here was wonderful and helpful. The amenities were amazing. We loved the rooftop pool and the views! amenities included the Bar Harbor Club which housed a workout room, and sauna. It was wonderful."
"4423",5,"The location feels like a small paradise. The views are breathtaking. Beautiful sunsets. While there are a lot of stairs down to the beach, they are real stairs built and provided by Seacrest. The beach feels like a private beach. Downtown and the pier are walking distance from Seacrest along the beach.No need to go anywhere. It would be nice... More"
"4424",5,"Bad: I couldn't understand why the fan constantly as if it never reached the desired temperature.Also that nightly service fee of 14.95 is a rip-off."
"4425",4,"Conveniently located, and the Link walkway was especially helpful."
"4426",3,"We were in the Buffalo area and needed an unexpected spot to crash for the night. Room was clean. It's an older motel so keep that in mind. Nothing boutique or special. But for a bed and place to land it worked. The advertised continental breakfast was a stretch, it was coffee and apples. Plan on grabbing food some place... More"
"4427",3,"Bad: the personel. Good: the decor"
"4428",5,"This perfect hotel is in the perfect location. The photos here don't do it justice. If you like trendy boutique hotels, then this is the perfect place for you to stay in Key West. We loved everything about our stay. The room and property were well kept and clean, the breakfast was plentiful and met our needs, and the staff were all very friendly. I would recommend this hotel for couples or a getaway with friends.Thank You, and a special thanks from the staff of The Saint Hotel Key West. We are extremely thankful for your recommendations and your excellent praise of the property. We hope we have the opportunity to accommodate you on your next trip to Key West."
"4429",5,"Stayed here 2 nights for a business/personal trip with my husband and our 2 kids.

Room was very spacious and clean with comfortable beds. The complimentary breakfast... More"
"4430",5,"I have stayed at this Hilton Garden Inn a few times. It has a very convenient location to the Raritan Center and many restaurant options. It is always clean and the staff is excellent. The hot tub is really hot."
"4431",5,"Awesome!"
"4432",5,"We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT"
"4433",5,"The hotel was very comfortable. I was there for one night, and chose it for the location. The staff was very nice and welcoming, the bed was super-comfortable, and I melted right into it. I awoke fresh, had a great breakfast in the lobby, and took the shuttle to the airport. Of course, the shuttle left precisely on time, as... More"
"4434",3,"Good hotel for the price. Good rooms with nice views-unsafe location that's why there is a shuttle from the hotel to the 15 minute walk subway station. Very Very basic and boring breakfast (eggs-potatoes-waffle-tea-coffee)."
"4435",4,"Good: Nice rooms, good beds and perfect location"
"4436",4,"This hotel is not within walking distance of the downtown Napa restuarants and shops, but it is within walking distance of several chain restuarants, stores and a movie theater. It served us well since we had a car and spent most of the day exploring the vineyards. They offer cereal bars, juice and coffee in the morning and you receive a discount at the Dennys next door. We would stay here again, mainly because of the cost benefit.Gregory K - Thank you for the great review. We are thrilled you enjoyed your stay and please come see us again soon!"
"4437",3,"We wanted to get away for a couple of days and hit the local casinos that are within a 20 minute drive from this location. The hotel is in a fairly sketchy area just south of I-10 near Vinton. There is a small video poker casino on the premises, but it was not our cup of tea. The room was... More"
"4438",1,"I gave this a 'this room is great for free wifi and sightseeing' review because there wasn't an option for absolutely nothing. We did have wifi, and we got to see a few drug deals in the parking lot, so that could qualify as sightseeing. The room itself was acceptable, the beds were clean, however, they should rethink their free pet policy as our room had ticks, and so we left, after being there two hours. The pictures on hotels.com are NOT pictures of this hotel. The staff was amazing...refunded our money, very apologetic, absolutely outstanding customer service."
"4439",5,"Close to Arlington Cemetery (15-20 minute walk)and Metro (10 min walk). Hotel is an older building but suitable for it's 2.5 star rating. Hi-speed internet in room was nice."
"4440",5,"Elsah is charming. The inn is a very short walk from the river and a view of the bluffs. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. The inn keeper gave us coupons for wine at the Grafton Winery and Restaurant where we enjoyed the sunset over the Mississippi. Breakfast was wonderful. I wish we could have stayed another night!"
"4441",5,"We had an amazing time. The hotel was a perfect place for us. And, every staff person we came in contact with was outstanding! We plan on going back."
"4442",5,"We love staying at this hotel. It's close to a casino, food and has a great pool/spa for the kids. We choose to have weekend fun nights here - it's close to outdoor activities that we enjoy and the town of Lacy is super cute."
"4443",5,"I loved my room, which had the same footprint as the A Loft I'd visited in Miami. Not a surprise--they're both Starwood properties. Comfortable and well-appointed with a kitchenette that had anything I might want or need during a business trip. Happy hour in the lobby as well as a light morning breakfast are also friendly and casual. The workout... More"
"4444",4,"Now has new owners and managers and it is getting BETTER! Have stayed here a few years in a row, it is a nice little place accross from the beach and close to everything! It needs a little TLC, but I think the new manager will get things done! can't wait to come back next year!!"
"4445",4,"The staff of this hotel is filled with kindness and professionalism. It is always a pleasure to be here. The location is perfect for walking to a vibrant restaurant scene. This is always my first choice when I visit the upstate and look forward to my return next week"
"4446",5,"Bad: There is nothing I didn't like. Good: Very friendly staff and very clean."
"4447",4,"Good location to get around on foot and see Chicago. We walked to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, restaurants, etc. The lobby is beautiful. The staff was friendly. Other reviews have complained about city noise (sirens and such) but it was not a problem in my opinion. You hear them, obviously, because you are in the city, but it's not constant."
"4448",4,"Nice hotel for families. We booked a 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds room. Lots of space and very clean. However, these rooms unfortunately do not have a very good view - they look into other rooms and courtyard. I think the studios have good views of the Space Needle. The breakfast buffet is great. Location is great - right across from Space Needle. We walked to Pike Place Market - a long but very doable walk.SFCALUSA,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

"4453",4,"Bad: The 'bathroom' area was open to the sleeping area. It was a unique design and certainly made the room seem larger. It was just a little odd. Also had to be careful about not hitting my head on the edge of the TV that was mounted on the wall between the sleeping area and the bathroom area. Good: The room was very spacious and the bed was quite comfortable. We were only there for the night but it was a pleasant stay."

"4474",5,"Mary and Rose are so sweet! The whole family had a fantastic visit. The kids said we could live here forever. Staying here was like staying with your favorite out of town relatives. It was clean, homey and comfortable. Our studio even had a blender! We plan to come back for a longer visit next year."

"4478",2,"The staff was great especially the valet. The room had no sound proof. Drunk people in the hall at midnight and we heard everything. We were on the 7th floor and everytime someone ran over a manhole cover we heard the noise clear as day. The worst was the tub though. You can tell they had a bath fitter installed but there was water between the old tub and the new liner so it felt as if we were showering on a water bed. Who knows what was growing in between the two surfaces. Also our one pillow had a big brown stain on it."

"4484",3,"Lovely location on a picturesque bluff overlooking a broad, golden beach, this resort hotel's ample grounds were also attractively landscaped. The rooms were nicely decorated and very comfortable. The free continental breakfast was quite ample and there is a 24-hour coffee service in the lobby. All this should have led to a very positive experience BUT...For one, there is no... More"
"4485",4,"Bad: a pool would be a plus.the bathroom was too little. Good: the room was comfortable and excellent location. Good value for the money"
"4486",1,"I asked for non-smoking room but doubt very much that the room assigned was non-smoking. It literally stinks. The surrounding of the property was poorly maintained, hardly swept. The outdoor pool area was even worst. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned for weeks. The garbage cans were overflowing from the day I get there. The following evening, it was still the same way. This should be rated as .5 star."
"4487",3,"The staff was very friendly and courteous. Sleeping was difficult due to nearby highway and hvac unit noise. TV and Internet worked well. The plaster work on the ceiling was unsightly and needs repair. Ceiling lamp had dead bugs. Breakfast was very good."
"4488",4,"This hotel almost exactly met my expectations. It's huge, has a beautiful setting, wonderful landscaping, and all the amenities you would expect from a giant resort. Also though, as you would expect from a mega resort, there is little personal attention, flexibility, and a general lack of attention to detail. We had an awesome room, Deluxe Ocean Suite, and would... More"
"4489",4,"Poker room really great management very friendly and helpful. Many choices of food so it is not boring. Plenty of activities gaming plenty of choices We played in a slot Tournament won some money The resort always have nice offers to play and stay we had a really good time"
"4490",4,"I tend to be pretty loyal to Marriott brands and built up quite a bank of Marriott points, so when I went to book a room in Anaheim for a trip to Disneyland using my points I booked the Towneplace Suites for three reasons: (1) It was a much better value than any of the other Marriott properties in Anaheim, as it was a Category 3 for points redemption while the others were at least a Category 5.(2) It was the only Marriott property in Anaheim that did not charge a daily parking fee. (3) Free continental breakfast. I tend to be pretty cost conscious, so I would much rather fill up on a free hotel breakfast than pay for fast food or worse pay Disneyland food prices.I still had a few doubts, but I went into the stay with an open mind and wasn't disappointed. My biggest concern, the location in relation to Disneyland, ended up being a non-issue. The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle ran like clockwork and I could be to the parks in less than 20 minutes. At a cost of only 12 for a three-day pass, it was much cheaper than parking at Disneyland and probably a good bit quicker as well. Even though the hotel isn't within walking distance of Disneyland I wouldn't hesitate to book again. The location was also a plus when I went to the Angels baseball game, as the stadium is about a half mile walk from the hotel. The room itself was more than adequate. The full size fridge and kitchenette with a dishwasher and stove was impressive but probably unnecessary for most hotel guests, however with the microwave and stocked dishes it would be very easy to prepare simple meals in the room to avoid the expense of eating out. The sleeping area was a totally separate bedroom which made it feel a little small, but it is probably about the same size as you would find in other Towneplace and other Marriott suite-style hotels. I think it is just the lack of openness that makes it feel small. Everything was nice and clean, no complaints there.I see that someone else complained about the breakfast, but I think it was as good as should be expected for free. I have seen fancier, but during my stay the breakfast included cereal (6 types), bagels, English muffins, yogurt, fresh whole fruit, instant oatmeal, and boxes of raisins (quite honestly I grabbed a few boxes each morning for snacks while in Disneyland). My only criticism would be to wait a little while longer to start shutting the breakfast area down, as 9:30am is still pretty early and most of these folks are on vacation after all.My only other complaint would be the toilet paper. I don't necessarily expect the nicest paper out there, but the stuff in my room was the roughest single-ply toilet paper I've ever seen. I think most gas station bathrooms have higher quality toilet paper than this. It just seems pretty ironic that while there was shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell the hotel couldn't spend a little more for a decent two-ply. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone going to Disneyland or to an Angels games, although I may encourage them to bring their own TP."
"4491",4,"A good value for travelers. You don't get the premium amenities but the hotel is clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast is rather standard but solid, you shouldn't go hungry. Well located right off the interstate it is convenient. You can't beat it if you're travelling."
"4492",5,"Rooms clean, digital check-in upon arrival was less than 60 seconds. Worth the time saving and convenience. Room was clean ad set up conveniently for comfort. This was my second experience with digital check-in and found it convenient and easy"

"4496",3,"Last minute decision to stay here. Front desk was friendly and helpful. Cheap price got us exactly what we expected - a no frills, bare bones room. Convenient location right off I75 South, next to lots of restaurants and a Whole Foods. Little tricky finding the entrance at night. Pool area looks like it would be good in the summer.... More"
"4497",4,"Overall it was pretty good...the staff were excellent..the free breakfast was GREAT. However, the shower didn't produce cold water until the 3rd person took a shower. Also, we didn't have a refridgerator in the room, so left overs from resturants were out of the question. But loved to have the ability to take a shuttle to the Metro Station, that then took me the DC so I didn't have to drive for a tour of DC. GREAT!!!"

The only thing that could be improve upon is to serve a full breakfast buffet YUM!I want to thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay. It is pleasing to know you were well accommodated by our staff and that you would recommend our hotel. Thank you again for your review. It would be our pleasure for you to repeat your experience with us in the future."

"4507",3,"The restaurant has a nice vibe. Staff are friendly and competent. Wine list a bit too simple. Food was good. The hotel is just average. Carpet in our room sorely in need of a cleaning. Bed was comfy but a double when a queen is pretty standard today. Bathroom was very, very clean. All rooms are very small. Internet sketchy."

"4512",4,"Bad: The room we stayed in has a window was facing an alley. We were woken up at 3 am by the garbage truck and they were there until 5.30 AM picking trash from the entire alley, not a good idea for light sleepers.

Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos.

"4544",5,"I stayed here with my wife to celebrate her 30th birthday. At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration!

Just so everybody knows...her dad and I were in the room at ALL times; no kids were left unsupervised. Her date needed a place to get ready because he had performed at a nearby arts event that ran right into Prom time, so he needed someplace close. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. We got some really wonderful pictures; my favorite was when the kids were reaching for the chandelier and it looked like they were reaching for falling stars. The staff helped us stage some really cool shots, and were just fantastic. The room was very clean and comfortable with plenty of mirror space and plug ins for curling irons; the window added lots of good, natural light. Lots of closet space let the kids get ready for after prom without too much problem.The only negative I have is that the hotel shuttle was not available, although when I called earlier in the week to make sure it was, I was assured that it would be available and that I didn't need a reservation. We had to scramble for rides to prom, which worked, but was a last minute stress we hadn't planned on having."

The front desk staff are very helpful. Only downfall, the double room beds are little bigger than twin beds."
"4562",3,"All in all, an OK experience. They have a little continental breakfast every morning, so that is nice. There is a Denny's across the street, so I did that a few mornings because I am a fan of a big breakfast variety. There is a gas station right next to the hotel that has a good selection of drinks and snacks, so that was a bonus because I didn't have to walk or drive far to get these items.

Today they are out of milk and waiting for a delivery. We bought milk from the hotel store to put on cereal and then realized it was expired.

I realized I had left my ring on the table next to the bed and asked if they could please check on it immediately. They promised to call me back - they never did. Due to my early checkout and my prompt call, I doubt the cleaning staff had even entered the room. So, I'm very unhappy about the ring - nothing overly expensive, but it did have some sentimental value.Accessible rooms themselves were much more adequate than most - we have a lot of experience in this area, and many accessible rooms are NOT truly accessible. For our second stay we were given a room that was on the top floor and the furthest room from the elevator. In an emergency, we would have never gotten out of that hotel. My husband is in a wheelchair. There is no way we would have made it down 9 flights of stairs, and trying to get 2 children and a manual wheelchair to the elevator was tiring and difficult. WHY don't hotels use a little common sense and realize that accessible rooms on LOWER floors would be more logical We were offered no assistance with luggage either stay.A huge plus for this hotel is that they are one of the very few hotels in Philadelphia that offer 2 Queen beds in a room. However, I was told by the front desk staff that none of the Queen rooms face the street. So, the windows in these rooms basically face other 'inside' rooms and offer very little light. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms do not have the tired and worn appearance that many hotels in Philadelphia do.Location for this hotel is very good. Very close to Jefferson University Hospital, Chinatown, Magee Rehabilitation hospital, restaurants, city hall, etc. Breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, yogurt, cereal, juice, beats 40+ for a family breakfast at a restaurant each day. I would do away with the microwave items altogether though.Price was very good, location great. While they could have done better in several areas, we plan to stay again."
"4576",5,"Stayed at this hotel for a couple of weeks travelling on business. An excellent business hotel, rooms are spacious and well maintained. Wifi works like a charm. Breakfast is sumptuous. Pickup is provided by hotel from the nearest bus stop."
"4577",5,"Where do I begin I can't express how well we were treated from the moment we entered until the minute we left. 1 The smell of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies as we entered the lobby at check-in! 2 The smile, wave, and welcome from the laundry room help as we passed on our way to the elevator to get...

"4580",5,"It was NICE, The room was clean and close to where I had to conduct business the next day."
"4581",4,"My girlfriends and I stayed here for two nights so that we could see a performance at the Majestic theater. The double queen suite was perfect for our needs, with a nice living area with comfy couch, ottoman, chair and big screen TV. The beds and pillows were heavenly! I highly recommend this hotel for sightseeing in downtown San Antonio."
"4582",4,"My sons basketball team participated in a tournament in Westminster and our organization reserved 30 rooms. The hotel did a great job of keeping us close together and the staff was great. The rooms, grounds, pool and bar were all clean and inviting. The only drawback was the restaurant/bar. I don't think they were sufficiently staffed for a sold out... More"
"4583",4,"Great stay. I would recommend staying here for business, family or couple weekend. Close to downtown Napa and Sonoma. The employees here are exceptional! So many options for breakfast. They also offer wine tasting if youre around at 5!"
"4584",3,"Really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to just about anyone. Loved the old Victorian ambiance and decor. The location was prime for us - we walked everywhere. Downsides are parking - had to park in the Commons garage but pretty walk back as long as it's not raining or snowing. And I really got the impression that a more traditional American bfast would be served but it was more like what you get at a chain hotel."
"4585",5,"This Microtel is immaculately clean, everything is sparkling and the service is topnotch and responsive. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are up to date and immaculate. There is even a mini-Laundromat with coin operated washing machine and dryer. Every morning there is an elaborate breakfast with lots of choices of fresh, tasty food."
"4586",4,"This hotel was in a great location--very convenient for a visit to Cornell. The prices were reasonable, and it was very nice to have a free breakfast and free coffee. The breakfast included eggs and homefries, as well as yogurt etc. Also, there was free coffee at all times of the day and night!"
"4587",5,"Stayed in the 2 room king suite. It was perfect. Loved the separate living room. Nice and clean and comfy bed. This hotel has room service and they took care of us very well. The valet were awesome and fast."
"4588",5,"We just returned from one week at the Honua Kai and would go back again. The resort was beautiful. We were initially in a one bedroom mountain view room . We arrived late at night so I did not get the full effect of the room until the next morning and I was not happy with the road noise that... More"
"4589",3,"My second cousin was getting married on the beach a short walk from this hotel, so I was very happy to find this place at a discounted price on the week of the trip. The hotel was fine overall but there were some small things that bugged me: * The beds were squeaky * The towels were scratchy * Some machinery within a locked area in the bathroom was running and making a lot of noise RIGHT next to the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom, next to the bed where my wife and I slept. It didn't keep me up at night, but it was noticeable. Some good things to make sure you don't think it was all bad: *The hotel's restaurant, Tradewinds, had great food, and it provided good room service AND it was the first time I'd seen room service at a reasonable price. *The hotel is right on the beach, and since it's not in the crowded part of VA beach shore, there's not so many other people to deal with. Also, the hotel is on the shore of VB that is in the Chesapeake Bay, so the water is much calmer than the beach along Atlantic Avenue something to consider if you have young children."
"4590",5,"This was a great stopover on our way to LA. Helpful staff. Rooms were very nice. Great for family travel. Lancaster was a bit out of the way but it worked fine for a late night and early morning. I was traveling with 3 teens so the two room suite with 2 queen beds really helped. Comfy beds, nice kitchenette.... More"
"4591",5,"Bad: Can be a little noisy at night but that is the compromise for being at the centre of all the action. Good: If you are looking to be at the centre of all the South Beach madness then this is the perfect hotel. Located right across from the beautiful beach and in the middle of the Art Deco district. Large comfortable rooms that offer full amenities. Good rooftop pool with great snack and drinks bar. Staff very helpful and John the concierge was great."
"4592",5,"We had a quick one night stay in Atlanta for business meetings. This hotel was great in terms of being quiet, short shuttle drive from Airport. The staff was very friendly at the front desk. They were very welcoming and quickly took care of multiple tasks and requests from guests. The room was enjoyable and as expected for a Hyatt... More"
"4593",4,"would stay at again. clean, comfortable and resonably priced. about a 15 min drive to the beach"
"4594",4,"Elevator (necessary for me) friendly staff clean, spacious room, comfortable bed. My husband and I arrived late, which was no problem for the concierge -- we were made to feel very welcomed, not as if we were putting anyone out."
"4595",5,"I had to request a room change because the initial room was not able to get wi-fi access (Room 405). We were allowed to move to Room 128 where it worked. The hotel was clean and up-to-date. Very pleasant. The breakfast bar was the best one we encountered on the entire trip. In fact, I can say of the five motels/hotels we stayed in on our trip -- in Pennsylvania and Virginia -- this one was the best."
"4596",3,"Nothing fancy, but cheap price and clean... Felt like this motel was built in 1950's....some sort of mobile home structure....small with one bed, but clean...had a tv with cable, a/c, and heat...view of woods in back....close to Acadia Park...no hair dryers in the room, but put one in per our request..."

"4600",4,"Nice stay, clean rooms. Right off the 15 fwy. The staff gave us the 2 rooms we requested next to each other. They were comfortable. The continental breakfast was sufficient. Walking distance to Peggy Sues diner. (Not affiliated with the one off the I-15 near Barstow)."

"4605",5,"Bad: paying extra for Valet Parking. Good: The Kings room"
"4606",5,"Bad: No complaints or dislikes. Good: Quality vs price was fantastic. Check-in was very friendly and above reproach. Cleanliness, comfy bed, quiet, and your typical serve yourself breakfast. Couldn't have asked for more for the price."
"4607",4,"The staff was very friendly and helpful! Some of the furniture is worn and needs to be replaced. However, the hotel is very clean. All in all I would say this was a good value, close to everything, lots of shopping and restaurants and only 10 minutes from the Inner Harbour."
"4608",3,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel overnight on our way back from a trip to NC from PA. We arrived after the normal check-in time, but we had to wait a few minutes for our room to be ready. After we settled in for the evening, one of the neighboring rooms occupants were having an argument. They proceeded to slam their door and yell in the hallway on and off for 30 minutes. They were loud enough to wake my husband over the television. When we left our room the next morning, the hallway reeked of marijuana and cheap air freshener. We were getting an early start on our traveling and even though the hotel offered a continental breakfast, nothing was available (not even coffee) before 7:00 am."
"4609",5,"Our stay at the Crowne Plaza in downtown Columbus was fantastic. The front-desk staff were kind and helpful. The lobby was sleek and modern. Our room was very clean and very well-lit--- which is very important when you're studying for the bar exam or doing work. The bathroom was very clean. The beds were comfortable. I loved the city views... More"
"4610",5,"Very nice hotel. The lobby was very modern and the staff were accommodating. The pool room and back patio were very nice. Would have liked a hot tub but none was available. The breakfast was warm and had a good variety. I liked having the access to the wifi and many places around the hotel to recharge my devices."
"4611",4,"Good: Location to Camden Yards, Inner Harbor and light rail stop."
"4612",5,"Great stay, quiet, and affordable. West Texas is famous for its hospitality and this place contributes mightily to that reputation. I especially liked the outdoor fire pit and sitting areas. I look forward to coming back."
"4613",4,"We were looking for a Saturday night stay. Most hotels require a 2-night minimum. Inn at the Vines would book a one night for a Queen bed, which was fine with us. AAA discount was 186. If you have a BW member then you get a free breakfast at Denny's which is next door. Hotel was refurbished about 1-year ago, so everything was clean and fresh. Only issue is the in-wall air conditioning units are too loud to run while sleeping.Great location and convenient to freeways.Thank you for your review! I am sorry about the noisey a/c unit and will have it checked out. Almost all units have been replaced and maybe we missed one somehow. Your sleep and comfort is our main goal and with a little fun on the side. Come back and let us show why we are BEST WESTERN!"
"4614",3,"This was a weekend get away for my husband's birthday. When we first arrived, the receptionist was pleasant but screwed up my information. Kept telling me that my credit card had declined I had booked through another travel company when I clearly showed her my reservation status verified that my credit card was in good standing. She then, goes get a manager who had gotten everything taken care of but didn't apologize on their end. After going through that (holding up the line because she was the only one working) she then tells us that the computer was down so she couldn't issue us room keys. We asked what were we supposed to do She said that she would send house keeping to out floor to let us in. House keeping even struggled to get in had to get another person to open the door. Finally, enter the room checked it thoroughly. Room was dusty bathroom sink was clogged when I washed my hands. Take a shower later on, and water leaked all over bathroom floor. Checked back 3 hours later for the room keys she told us the machine was still down so we had to wait an additional hour or so. Upon check out the next morning, a different young lady ask how was our stay, I explained briefly our experience. She then tried to cover up for the hotel saying Oh, it's just that the building is older and gave us a free breakfast ticket which the food was nasty Luke warm (NOT HOT). Very disappointed! Will not be staying here again."
"4615",3,"We had a good stay in this hotel, it was clean and comfortable, everything was ok as far as the basic services, but the wireless internet did not work well at all during our 6 day stay. I would not recommend this hotel if you want reliable wireless internet access, I noticed that other guests had similar issues with the wireless access."
"4616",3,"Booked this place to stay the night for a wedding that I was attending. It was me and a couple of buddies so all we really needed was a place to crash at the end of the night. It was fine for that. Would I bring my lady here for a romantic trip, no. But if you need an affordable... More"
"4617",5,"Bad: Worst bartender ever. Long Island Iced Tea missing a few ingredients, King Alphonse was actually a Kahlua and cream with ice. Ugh. In-room coffee machine didn't work, took two days to get fixed, and then made awful coffee. Morning coffee from the restaurant was undrinkable. Thankfully, Starbucks nearby. Good: Best restaurant for dinner of any hotel anywhere. Entrees superb, bread pudding beyond superb. Excellent security staff -- Cheerfully and efficiently retrieved my forgotten keyboard, assured me it was safe, and FedExed it to me no charge. Decor stylish, cozy room made clever use of small space, room clean, rain shower nice. Non-convention type hotel very appealing. Really great value in accessible walkable location."
"4618",3,"The hotel was clean and staff was friendly but the bed was rock solid and after sitting in my car for long due to the weather my back didn't need any help in feeling worse. Breakfast was tasty, but cold in the sitting area being directly in front of the doors where all the cold air came sweeping in."
"4619",5,"Plates outside of hotel room door when we arrived stayed there all day and evening Bed extra comfy. Very courteous staff."

"4628",4,"Breakfast not as good as last time - air conditioner blowing on us while sleeping. Location, breakfast menu, comfortable bed"
"4629",2,"This hotel needs a better ventilation system!! The whole place smelled of smoke and farts. I found the casino to be very dreary and outdated. The rooms were very clean and we had a nice view. We had breakfast there and the smell of smoke permeated the restaurant so bad it was hard to eat. I wouldn't stay here again, for sure."
"4630",1,"The airline put me here when weather delayed my flight and I missed the connection. The place is not well maintained in general. I will put up with a lot, but when a dozen cockroaches run out of the room when I opened the door, I'm out. This place should be condemned."
"4631",5,"This hotel is fantastic! The staff is great and goes above and beyond for the guest. Extremely clean and the place looks brand new, the staff obviously takes a lot of pride. The only thing that is lacking is the breakfast but that's a given at most hotels."
"4632",5,"I stayed here with my family for my daughters wedding. It had a very accommodating staff, Olivia was excellent. The rooms were very well maintained. Would highly recommend this hotel, especially if your wedding venue is Celebrations at the Bay!"

We can't wait for your return for another Monkey Board rooftop bar and dj music experience. Ron Olstad, General Manager"
"4635",4,"Nice and clean. Decent sized TV that you can rent movies, N64 games, go online, or listen to music. Not much closet space, only get one dresser, but plenty of hanging room. Nice bathroom. Bed was comfortable, but pillows were a little stiff. Kitchen was large enough. Full sized refrigerator with freezer. They have some pots and a pan, and a broiler pan, but no cookie sheets. Plenty of utensils and glasses, and a few things like serving spoons. There's a dish washer, and they give you the detergent. Good microwave, and cabinet space. The oven wasn't the best, but good enough. Take advantage of kitchen, stuff down here is expensive. Friendly staff that was multi-lingual, but spoke English very well. I think their website said olympic sized swimming pool, but the pool was not Olympic sized. There was a lifeguard on duty, but he did not double as a pool boy so there was a good bit of leaves and stuff floating around. Overall I was very happy with the hotel and would definitely stay here again."

"4642",4,"The rooms were comfy and big. Not many minutes from the boardwalk or city centre. On the negative side the surrounding area is a bit gritty, but that is a AC problem, so you really cant blame the hotel."

The front desk response was that the hotel was busy and it was not unheard of for rooms not be done at 6pm - and offered an apology as did housekeeping.

"4658",4,"Quiet neighborhood. Less than 10 miles to Sea World, Old Town, and Seaport Village. Double bed rooms do NOT have a sofa sleeper, as indicated when I booked (should be changed by now). We've stayed at several hotels in this chain, and we've always had a sofa sleeper and, usually, queen beds. Hotel staff was very accommodating, though, when I discovered this and they came up with a satisfactory solution. Breakfast is good, although very crowded."
"4659",4,"We had a terrific view of the ocean and beach. The room was big, the beds and pillows was comfortable. The only problem was the fan in the shower/toilet room was extremely noisy, the toilet was too close to the toilet paper dispenser and there wasn't enough counter space for our toiletry items. We had to leave most things in our toiletry bags and use the items from them. Otherwise, the room was great and it was nice to hear the roar of the ocean every night. All staff was very friendly however we were told that there would be a concierge who would sell us tickets for the whale cruise but we never saw a concierge for the 2 days that we were there. We went directly to the cruise ticket office instead. We will probably stay there again if we go back to Virginia Beach."
"4660",2,"This place is as basic an accommodation as you can get in downtown Atlanta while still being suitable. Yes there is free parking but this place is so cheap that they don't even give you free shampoo in the bathroom - just two little bars of facial soap. Place isn't in the greatest area (downtown Atlanta is kind of sketchy at night) but is centrally located. For a healthy restaurant nearby I recommend Metrofresh - it's less than a ten minute drive and totally worth it! Basic cheap motel quality beds, old TVs, frustrating elevator that takes forever to close and absolutely NO FRILLS. Got it for 53/night using a coupon code on the Motel6 website."
"4661",1,"First night was okay, there a band aid was in the pool, my gf pointed it out and we left to our room. Second night a water pipe burst causing water outage for the whole building and damaging their computer area. Our room and our friends adjacent room had ants in it. The phone in our room was not connecting to any inner hotel numbers so we couldn't have notified them of this issue or any medical emergency even if we wanted to using their phone system. When we left Sunday morning I notified the front desk of these issues and they said hotel GM would be calling me to try and rectify the situation. This never happened. After waiting a week I contacted the hotel for a refund for the one night and they informed me since I booked through Expedia I would have to contact them. After getting a hold of Expedia they contacted the hotel and were able to retrieve 1/2 of the cost of the night. I was amazed the hotel would not refund us our entire night considering the conditions of the rooms and lack of basic services. We could not go to the bathroom for the entire night (verified this at 10 PM, and again in the morning at 10 AM, the water in the toilets were backing up after one flush) and had to drive down to Chevron a few miles down the road to use their facilities and purchase drinking water. I can't even begin to comprehend how refunding half the night for these kind of inconveniences is fair to anyone who stayed during this time. I cannot recommend this place."
"4662",4,"The hotel was very accommidating for me and my dogs! The staff was very friendly and helpful."
"4663",4,"We needed some amusement park tickets printed and the business center printer wouldn't work, so Jennavee at the front desk entered all of my info and used the office printer for my tickets. All with a smile!"

Floor, wall, corners, ceiling all needed cleaned and renewed.... More"
"4665",5,"I was pleasantly surprised. I've stayed at many Hampton Inns and have always been pleased, but this one was a cut above! I like that it was tucked back off the main street and very conveniently located. The room was pristine, while still being inviting and comfortable. The staff was excellent. I will be back!"

"4671",5,"Surprised by the quality of this hotel-very clean well furnished rooms , professional and friendly staff-no complaints. It was very quiet and convenient. Very central location from which to visit Mt. Dora and other destinations."
"4672",5,"I stayed in 809, and it was an absolute blast. The view and overall feeling of the suite exactly what I needed. Treat yourself to it, and walk the hotel to view a ton of local art. It's everything I want in a downtown hotel. Beautiful design, comfy rooms, that wow factor, local focused, and friendly staff.Thank you so much for this awesome review! We hope you'll come back and stay with us again soon."
"4673",4,"Bad: Not much of a view. Good: Great location. Small hotel with good service. Lots of pillows:)"
"4674",3,"Our softball team stayed here for a tournament in Duquoin. This is just an average hotel. The bedding is badly in need of updating. The bedding had holes in them! Breakfast was ok. Waffle maker, muffins, cereal, toast, bagels. The hallways smelled like smoke, however the rooms did not. The staff was friendly and courteous."
"4675",5,"Came to area to visit Washington D C, Mt. Vernon and monticello without having to drive everywhere. Although we drove to mt Vernon one day and Monticello on the way home it was nice not having to drive into DC to find a place to park."
"4676",4,"We booked this particular La Quinta because its location off I-10 was convenient for our long roadtrip. Great price on hotel website, and room was new and clean. My son liked the pool, and it was nice to have complementary waffles and fruit for breakfast. Staff were friendly and helpful. There were a couple of shady characters hanging around outside, but we never felt unsafe. I have a feeling this area might not be the best part of town."
"4677",3,"This hotel was a good value. The rooms are clean and comfortable and mine was newly upgraded. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. The only real issue is the noise...constant hammering that seemed as though it was in the room next to me. Also, the hot water in my bathroom did not function, so I ended up taking a cold shower. Needless to say, the noise and lack of hot water made for a disappointing stay from the standpoint of comfort. Still, a good value with easy parking and not too far from either DC or Baltimore if you are visiting."
"4678",3,"We checked in late...around 1 am. The lady at the desk was really nice and she was every night we saw her. I was disappointed with the front desk during the days. We needed clean towels at one point and were told we had to wait until housekeeping came in....which was one hour later! I know from other hotel stays that they could have at least got some for us to pick up. The room did smell a little bit musty also. Over all it was a decent stay. It did have a very convenient access to the highway heading in to D.C., so that was a plus."
"4679",5,"Quiet location in an office park. 15 minutes to downtown Boston. Great location for touring the city."
"4680",5,"In DC at the beginning of the Labor Day weekend, and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The service was fantastic from the moment we arrived by taxi, through check-in, and culminating in a turn-down service that was just the extra special treatment we loved. There were special weekend events like a family movie with tons of snacks, wine and cheese tasting in the lobby, even a magician for the kids. I loved it. The kids loved it. I would recommend highly and definitely stay again when in the DC area. The metro is right outside the front door!"

"4683",2,"The side door was broken and stuck open-not safe by my standards. There was plastic food storage under my bed skirt. My room was comfortable and a great breakfast started at 4am which helps for early flights."
"4684",3,"We checked into this hotel on Saturday for one night. Check in was smooth and easy. We asked for a first floor room when we reserved. They only had an ADA room left which was fine with us. We travel with a lab and first floor is easier for her. The hotel was quite pet friendly but the dog walking area was limited and there was no bag and disposal station. The location is convenient and right off I10. The area is a little run down but I not to the point of feeling any safety issues. The room was comfortable and clean with the usual amenities. The air conditioner was hard to get on the right temperature. The was no wall temperature setting so you had to adjust it at the unit which was an older knob type. It took quite a while before we were not frozen out (which is better than the alternative in Phoenix). The hallway carpet was getting a little worn and could stand to be replaced. On to the breakfast. This was a pleasant surprise as it was better thsn the typical La Quinta breakfast. First of all there was real coffe, not an instant machine. There was also sausage links and multiple berry toppings for the waffles and whipped cream. I usually don't eat these things for breakfast but since they had them it was a nice treat. The cinnamon toast also looked inviting.Overall a good stay for one night. Given the lack of other things to do at that location I would not consider it for an extended stay."

I pressed for the room I booked and eventually got the room I wanted. On top of that, they included drink tickets. The trip started a little rough but it was great. Hotel is situated in a great place and all the amenities like the pool and bar were fantastic."

Front Desk and Dining room staffs were very Friendly. We arrived on time to check in so that we have more time to see Seattle. But, our room was not ready. We waited for couple of hours in the lobby before it became available. What Not very impressive!Then the whole night our wifi wasnt working. They said they will reset the router as soon the Technician arrives but it was already too late. We had to check out early for our City Tour and our cruise Housekeeping I think they have to pay more attention in terms of their room services. Towels and toiletries supplies were not enough to accommodate 5 people. We had to request some more supplies.

"4711",3,"The hotel was generally clean, well maintained, comfortable beds, towels at poolside, breakfast buffet reasonably stocked. However, there were a couple of problems with our room. We stayed in room 120 for two nights. First, when we entered the room we were all struck by a kind of damp feeling and ammonia smell. I thought it was just cleaning fluid and our noses did adjust in a few minutes. However, upon reentering the room each time the smell was always there and did not go away. Additionally, paper left in the room got that kind of damp feel about it where it goes a little limp, and wet clothes hung up upon our arrival were still damp two days later, even though the air conditioner was on the whole time. Theres almost certainly water collecting somewhere in the room causing the ammonia smell and damp feeling. Its worth noting that the air conditioner was new and quiet and worked fine, and I wouldnt have suspected any problem. However, my suspicion is that it was set to recirculate or perhaps the drain was clogged, or both. I looked for a recirculate control on the A/C, but couldnt find one. Either that or theres a plumbing leak somewhere in the room, though I saw no sign of it. I reported this to the clerk on checkout. The other problem is that the tub drain was misaligned with tub floor and would not close properly, so it was impossible to take a tub bath. The clerk offered to switch our room, but it was not worth the trouble since we were checking out soon."

"4713",3,"This hotel is conveniently located off 1-10 but for the price we were a bit disappointed. The carpet in the hallway on our floor was very wrinkled, needs to be restretched or replaced and we had a lot of trouble getting our door open as the keylock was rickety and had a sort of personality of its own you had to lean on the door at the same time as putting the keycard in the slot. There was a lot of noise from someone in the room above us, walking or jumping on the floor which of course was our ceiling. It went on for a long time and made it so my mom couldn't sleep so I called the front desk to complain. The front desk clerk must have called them so it stopped for a good while, happened again briefly and then stopped for the night. The breakfast was good, pretty standard for La Quinta and I liked that they had Mexican salsa, fried potatoes and good sized disposable paper coffee cups. I don't like the weird industrial type scrambled eggs at this and other La Quintas because they don't even seem like real eggs at all, more like some liquid egg heated in a microwave. They have little flavor and the texture leaves a lot to be desired. Wish they were real, freshly cooked eggs and that someone in top management at La Quinta headquarters would pay attention and improve that. That would definitely improve my opinion of their breakfasts!Dear Traveler,Thank you for choosing our property for your traveling needs. We are working on plans to renovate the hotel this year. It is our hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W."
"4714",5,"We had a very positive experience at this hotel. Our party (2 adults, 2 teenagers) had plenty of room to spread out. We had a pull-out sofa sleeper, roll-away bed, kitchenette, and queen-sz. bed. There was a large dressing area off the bathroom, a great place for suitcases, etc. The furniture was contemporary and new, beds were very comfortable.

It is across the street from the stadium and there are a few places to eat that range from Carls Jr to a nicer sit down restaurant (The Catch I think). The hotel provides a continental breakfast which was a pretty standard hotel breakfast. It's always convenient when traveling with kids. There was barely any room to sit and very busy. One morning I ended up finding a table and the next morning I took our food out to the pool and sat out there with the kids which was very peaceful. The pool area is small, but enough to keep the kids busy for a couple of hours. It was a nice temperature, not too cold. They also loved going between the pool and jacuzzi. The room slept 6 of us, but was not spacious. It was nice to have the 2 queens in separate bedrooms and a living area, so if someone wanted to rest, they could close the door and others could watch TV in another room. There were 3 TVs. The beds were OK. The bathroom was small considering the room slept 6 people (not 6 adults, but doable with a mixture of adults and kids). The kitchen area was more than adequate to bring some food with you, prepare it and not eat out every meal. The decor is updated, but some areas of the room felt worn. The room was clean and we had excellent service at the front desk.Hello Snulie,Thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott.

"4732",3,"Bad: There is nothing on website or booking.com about the rules, and there are many, at this hotel, or that it is a quiet hotel. There is nothing about quiet hours starting at 11 on the sites either. Nothing about the limit to number of people that can visit you in your room. Nothing about the fact that when people come to see you they will be detained at the gate and not allowed to enter if you have more than 4 extra people you are visiting with in your room or the outside courtyard area. If these are the rules then fine, but we would NOT have stayed here if we had known this .Please put this information on both sites so that others do not have the same experience we did. A woman in the office was very rude and threatened to call the police for no reason. She was extremely rude and disrespectful and threatening during our stay. There are ways to communicate respectfully and calmly and this was not the case. I would never ever ever tell anyone to stay at this hotel. In fact, I will tell everyone I know to avoid going to this hotel unless they want to be treated rudely. I am sure that this woman in the office will respond saying she was not rude or threatening, but take my word, I do not ever write reviews and this is exactly what occurred and it made the stay unpleasant and uncomfortable and impossible to make plans to go out with friends. Ridiculous."

"4740",1,"I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering. This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons:1) They don't honor their commitments. I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque). At checkout, no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay. Overall, the location is great, the rooms are clean and quiet, and all of the appliances work.

"4750",1,"We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the 1st weekend in Jan.We never have issues but when it rains it pours with this group...We checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a re-rate. They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect. We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium."

"4755",4,"Bad: The staff, specially at the restaurant is arrogant and not well trained. The pool area wasnt cleaned in the morning, cleaning ladies came later on and did only the basic to clean it. Rooms in the first floor are noisy and you can hear the music of the restaurant below. A gym would be a very nice to have. Good: The rooftop pool was so nice and with a beautiful view to the sea. Rooms are absolutely cosy. The restaurant is nice furnished and serves excellent food. Excellent location."
"4756",5,"Stayed here July 22-25, 2016. The front desk people were true gems, very helpful and friendly. The rooms were clean and wifi was free. All guest rooms have a refrigerator and a microwave. The breakfast buffet was great, lots of variety and both hot and cold foods. Free chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies in the lobby each night."
"4757",5,"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed."

If you can stay here during the week it is actually pretty reasonable but it gets really expensive on weekends. Except for the cost however we found little to complain about. The staff is very attentive and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. My only complaint was that the breakfast, though good, was nothing special."

"4774",5,"From the beginning to the end of my stay, the hotel staff was extremely accommodating. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
"4775",4,"Hotel is in the perfect spot at the perfect price with the not so perfect view. Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!"

"4790",1,"Something is seriously wrong with the hotel in this casino! Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much. Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern, and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation. At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature. While we can understand your frustrations, please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this. We hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip, the Grand Canyon must have been amazing to see in person!"

Even after waiting for an hour, they didn't have a room for us. We stood up there waiting for about 30-45 more minutes, and they decided to give us a room with a kitchen, living room area and a fireplace in lieu of what we reserved. I have to say, they were very accommodating and we appreciated the extra space. They were very nice and did all they could to make it right- and we were very happy about our room when we finally got it!! Now, on to the free breakfast that is offered....it is amazing!!! Biscuits, white gravy, oatmeal(with all kinds of toppings to put in it!), bacon, grits, eggs, hash browns, cereal, toast, bagels(all types of cream cheese and butter and jellies), coffee, hot chocolate, apple juice, cranberry juice, orange juice and milk...there was sooooo much!

"4830",5,"Used for last night before flight. Hotel was immaculate. Staff was friendly and efficient. Breakfast was standard but what we expected. Would definitely choose again. Were also helpful when cancelling earlier arrival reservation due to flight cancellation. Will review airline in separate review."
"4831",3,"The ad says that the rooms have been redone and the pictures look great, but in reality we had a poorly patched hole in the bathroom door, rusty tub fixtures, and the obviously new paint was chipping. Comforters looked new, but the sheets were super scratchy. Also, it is a motel style place (which was not clear from the ad), which means people smoke off the balcony outside their room and the air conditioner sucks the gross smoky smell into your room. It was fine for last minute since literally nothing else was available last minute for the night were were staying for business in DC, but normally for an extra 20 bucks you could find something MUCH nicer."
"4832",4,"We needed a place to stay close to the venues for a basketball tournament, and wanted a Hilton property. Other than wishing breakfast was complimentary, we had no complaints and were very pleased with our stay. The neighborhood alone is worth the decision to stay at this hotel,"
"4833",4,"Nice size rooms. Breakfast and drinks and the reception a plus! The kids loved the pool. Very close to downtown, only 10 min. drive. We will be back!"
"4834",3,"This hotel could use upgrading. It is clean enough, but truly bare bones. Of greater concern was the mandatory destination fee of 9.95 per day that tacked on the bill. There was no option to decline it, and I was not informed ahead of time. In essence, it adds 10 to the room charge. I booked this hotel because the price seemed reasonable. But at 10 more per day, I could have stayed at a nicer hotel for the same price."
"4835",5,"Cool piece of history, but nicely up to date. Friendly staff and reasonable price. A little of the beaten path but worth looking for. The four of us stayed in the family suite. 2 rooms, king bed, queen/ double bunk bed. lots of room, great mattresses."
"4836",2,"So I stayed here for one night in room 114 (their only king 1 bedroom suit) and it was ok but looked like they just gave it a quick once over after the last guest stayed. Didn't think much of it as I was planning on checking out in the morning. I also noticed a small stain on one of... More"
"4837",3,"The reason I choose this motel was it was the least expensive motel in the area with a total cost with all taxes and fees of about 70.00 a night. Though not expensive, it is a higher end price especially for a motel and for that you would expect to have a very decent to excellent motel room. That was... More"
"4838",5,"Very comfortable, but location was not the best. Hotel in general was nice and clean."
"4839",3,"In town for a funeral. The hotel was okay. Heat/AC was noisy. Wires across floor in common area a trip hazard. Employees were pleasant. The room was a little suite, but was oddly set up. Some of the furniture was too big for the room, almost totally blocking the small closet. But overall no major complaints."
"4840",1,"The place is a complete dump! The rooms are super small and cramped. They don't care about their customers and house keeping could do a way better job on the cleanliness of the rooms. There's not enough parking and the chance of your vehicle getting hit by another is highly possible. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone staying... More"

"4848",3,"You may want to view your room first,before you bring all your stuff to the location.

"4849",4,"This was adequate for our short Christmas season get-a-way and met our needs very well. Breakfast is somewhat limited, but we were satisfied. We did our sightseeing in Jefferson, Texas and this was the closest Best Western."
"4850",4,"the room is very nice. It's very modern and a bit on the side of a luxurious room. there's a Keurig Coffee machine. The room is relatively small, but I would say this is norm for downtown Chicago. I'm paying maybe 170/night before taxes and fees."
"4851",2,"They told me my husband could check in without me but when he arrived they stated I had to be there. They were unprofessional with bad attitudes. There were grown women intoxicated knocking on doors and running. They were in the halls making a lot of noise. This hotel has a club inside and attract the wrong people."
"4852",5,"The hotel was lovely! The staff was very friendly and the room was clean. The bed was very comfortable. The room contained all the a needed amenities. While room service was pricey, the food was very good. It is also close to Marta, restaurants, and a park."
"4853",5,"Amazing hotel for the price, the staff was very nice. I would definitely stay again if I need to. Close to places and the bed was very comfy."
"4854",5,"Not only was the room clean, modern, and nicely decorated, but it also slept my family of seven comfortably. We booked the 2 Queen beds suite which also had a pull out sofa bed as well Great value for the money, highly recommended I will book a room again at this chain"

Front staff were very helpful and the breakfast was great. Shuttle (ART pay as you go or get a pass at the office) was just outside the door as was Denny's and Starbucks. Not the usual Mariott standard though. Older- small pool. --Hence the 3 star.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your review. I am sorry to hear that we did not live up to your expectations.

"4867",5,"A gorgeous hotel! Not a typical Hampton Inn. Easy to find and the location is convenient to vineyards, downtown Napa and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and movie theater. Inside the hotel is gorgeous and the guest rooms are all suites and huge! Mini fridge, huge shower, I could live in this room!"
"4868",5,"cant think of anything Location, helpful staff, quiet room, good beds, wifi and breakfast."
"4869",5,"All of the usual accolades to a good hotel apply here. But I was particularly impressed by the employees' response when my 15-year-old granddaughter decided to socialize with some boys she met at the pool and didn't bother to tell me where she was going. The hotel's front desk and security people were extremely efficient and courteous in locating her, saving her 70-year-old grandfather much angst! And the service people in the restaurant area also went out of their way to get to know us."
"4870",5,"Very pleasant experience, I have no complaints whatsoever. The staff was friendly, the room was clean and quiet. Reasonably priced as well. The breakfast wasn't the World's best but it did the job! I would recommend if you are needing to stay in the Austin area."
"4871",5,"Needed a hotel near the West Village and with parking -- this was perfect. Hotel is very chic, and room was comfortable with lots of storage which offset its small size. Will definitely be using this hotel again in the future."
"4872",5,"Everyone including Ismael at this hotel went above and beyond to make our experience great. The hotel is a bit pricy but the location, service and comfort of the room made it worthwhile. Proximity to Santa Monica Pier, the Promenade shopping area, restaurants- All great too..."
"4873",5,"Excellent. Gracious clear staff, perfectly cleaned and maintained. It is noteworthy that there is a fee for internet, but the fee was waved for me. Spa and exercise options are very good. The free shuttle from the airport is great."
"4874",2,"The overdone maritime theme makes this place creepy. Everything is painted dark blue--it's overwhelming and depressing."
"4875",4,"The hotel was good. Clean rooms and friendly staff, unfortunately, there is nothing to do in the immediate area. It is close to the Metro station but other than that, there were not a lot of choices within walking distance for shopping, restaurants, etc."

"4877",5,"This motel was a good surprise. Our room was very clean, and still smelled of bleach. The floor is hardwood, not carpet. I guess it's because of the pets allowed it's also easier to clean. Overall, this motel is an excellent option in Escalante, and don't miss the attached restaurant (Circle D eatery), which is very good."

"4884",3,"Advertised as a golf resort, but the golf course has been closed for well over a year. One small swimming pool was open, the large lap pool and fitness center are closed :( Not updated in a long time, it's 4 unit 2 story bungalows for much of the property. Quiet, easy access to San Diego which is a 20+ minute drive."

"4886",5,"The staff were especially helpful and nice. I showed up at one in the morning and still received a courteous reception. Breakfast in the morning was good as far as continental's go, and the bed was quite comfortable with fresh soft sheets."

"4888",4,"The location was right off the highway which was perfect. The hotel is outdated, but the rooms were clean and functional. Everyone working here was very happy and helpful. It also had a decent breakfast. All in all I thought it was a great value and would stay here again.."
"4889",5,"I was attending a conference at the River Hotel (January 30-31, 2016). This was purely business so I wanted to minimize my stress by staying at (or near) the conference location by being able to fly in, then shuttle to from O'Hare airport and yet have plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel. The River Hotel found me a small room for a VERY reasonable (unbelievable) rate. Yes, I have read the reviews about the small rooms. This one was small. There was one queen sized bed, a desk, a pull out work station, and a full (shower) bath. Period. No extras. Yet it met MY needs (listed above) and my usual criteria of CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, and SAFE. The staff was EXCELLENT. I received friendly, efficient 5 star service for a 3 star price - from every single employee shift - both day night. I received free bottled water from a water station in the hallway. The vending machines were reasonable. My 17th floor small room, overlooked the river, the Trump Tower, the River Walk, and the city lights and sounds only added to the ambiance. I took the elevator down, crossed the lobby, took another elevator up to the conference (the two elevators - activated only by your room key card - ensured that the guest rooms were secure from being accessed by non guests). Even the conference was well prepped and attended by the hotel staff with fresh coffee, tea, and complimentary sodas that were refreshed at every break. I could continue... But suffice it to say that I was IMPRESSED. YES. My room was small. However, the break in price was compensation for this and (since I was only needing work space sleep) I did not NEED more. That said, if I am ever in Chicago again - for work or vacation - I WILL be back. NOTE: The hotel has an on site Italian Restaurant called Bella Bacinos. I will review it separately. For now, suffice it to say the food was DELICIOUS, the service was also 5 star, and the price - while not as inexpensive as I am accustomed to - was as affordable (more so) than comparable places nearby. Just be aware that a small is a medium... a medium is a large... etc. Yum!Dear John S,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your detailed review of your experience.We are so proud of our staff services as well as our prime location and are delighted you were pleased as well. There is nothing I like more than sharing great comments with the team and I will certainly pass along your kind words.We are beyond thrilled to know we are your hotel of choice when visiting Chicago. We will look forward to welcoming you back soon!"
"4890",5,"Great hotel. So much more character than staying in one of the big chain hotels. The building was a transformed warehouse, so walls are old brick, floors are resurfaced wood, etc. Very Cool. Super helpful staff. Great coffee shop restaurant downstairs. Definitely will return."
"4891",4,"Hotel appearance is modern, very clean and stylish. It looks very upscale and was a bargain for what we paid per night (mid week). Its large and as such, was a loooonnggg walk to get out of the hotel there is a lot of winding through the Crystal shops and then a plunge outside and then back into the lobby.... More"
"4892",4,"I found this trip on this site and I'm glad I did, it was a great choice. The rooms are smallish but comfortable, and since the trip was a Conference, I wasn't going to be here much anyway.Complimentary wireless access makes this an even better deal. The restaurant is OK but not great (room service through them was very unfriendly), but they have a Starbucks next door for breakfast as well. Conveniently located."
"4893",4,"Overall, I enjoy this hotel. I have stayed there a total of 5 times for business purposes. Each stay was for nearly a week. The staff are always warm and welcoming. A decent free breakfast and decent free wifi. My bathroom has been ""dirty"" a few times, such as hair in the sink or toilet. But nothing horrible enough to request another room. Overall, great stay."
"4894",5,"This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!"

"4897",5,"My wife and I loved this hotel. Our large room was beautifully decorated...with a super comfortable bed. The ambiance of the hotel I would describe as urban chic boutique-style luxury art gallery hotel. The location is wonderful for exploring the charming neighborhood and nearby downtown. The service was excellent. Brunch was delicious in the charming restaurant. Bottom line - it combines a fun, happening atmosphere with a great stay. I doubt we'd look anywhere else in the future. This is the hotel of choice.Hi Doug K,Thank you for your kind words! We think you're pretty great too! We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!"

"4899",4,"Rooms greatly exceeded expectations. Nice and clean. Seems like a sketchy area, but I am sure once renovations are complete and the parking lots has more cars that perception will change.

"4908",2,"The room was supposed to be a non smoking room yet the smell made it clear that previous patrons had smoked and more than just cigarettes. There was a cigarette burn on the wall above one of the beds. The overall condition of the room was disappointing especially when it cost 80.80 for a one night stay."

They provide more than just coffee and danish in the morning there is real food. Plus snack items designed to help you make it through a difficult day on the Hill. Convenience to the Metro is a big plus, and it's provided by a shuttle. Wait staff goes out of its way to accommodate and address problems if any. We have, of course, other options as far as where to stay in the DC area, but this Best Western has my vote hands down right price, right place, right service. It's a winning hand all the way."

"4935",3,"Bad: Dropped in for advice on a good Japanese restaurant. The concierge seemed perplexed and said he would call or email with info. He never did. In fact there was a great sushi just in front of the hotel. Very strange. When I called the concierge from outside the hotel I was put on hold and left on hold. I could have died on hold. The rooms need a facelift and I have stayed in better for half the price. The restaurant for breakfast is soulless and very expensive and not up to much. Regarding the above you have many comments on TripAdvisor about the same so why not do something about it. Good: Joyce the concierge ( I think that was her name) made up for the others who probably couldn't find Los Angeles on the map. The pool. The location That's it."
"4936",5,"Our hotel staff recommended we check it out for the view and brew and we just loved it! Such a cool idea to re-use a character filled building! There's a little something for everyone there...we checked out a new movie for only 3 and enjoyed drinks and food while relaxing in comfy couches. Prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere...

"4940",1,"Good location, but DIRTY hotel! In my opinion, it should be DOWN-rated to a 2-star hotel. It's OLD, the room I stayed in smells musty, and the common areas were DIRTY!"
"4941",1,"I am not sure who wrote the reviews on this place nor when they were written. evidently they have not been there recently. The outside looks very good but, beware! The man at the register was unhappy and it showed. The rooms he assigned us had not been cleaned, beds unmade and had a horrendous odor. The swimming pool was... More"

"4955",5,"We only stayed one night, but everything was great. The hotel employees were very helpful and friendly. The service was great. And, the breakfast is always a plus, especially when you have kids. You can sit down and enjoy yourself, then go to destinations."
"4956",5,"Starting with the location - excellent. Perfect to explore the downtown area on foot, many attractions within walking distance or the free shuttle will take you.The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. We loved having a small kitchen, we loved everything about the room.We were helped by Behder at the front desk who answered all out questions and made us feel very welcome.Any time we return to Seattle, there will be no other option for us than the Hyatt House."

This place is right out of Good Fellas - great ambiance, and old school vibe with great food. We've never stayed here, but always enjoy gambling here and coming for an occasional drink, or to watch a movie at the theater."
"4968",4,"The Ramada hotel is located in Kingman, in Arizona. I might be wrong, but Kingman does not have much to offer to tourist.

My daughter loved the pool, and it was kept up nicely. Not having to leave for dinner or breakfast was a huge plus. All the guests we met while there had smiles on their faces, I'm sure it was because of the great atmosphere Drury staff created."
"4975",4,"Pleasant room with small bathroom and closet. Clean (air freshener a little strong at first) with comfortable beds. A/C worked fine. Fridge Microwave were useful. Staff friendly and helpful. All in all very good value stopover with easy access to the freeway."
"4976",2,"Very disappointed...this is a 3 star It is a 40+ year old hotel they are trying to bring up to date. I commend them for trying to make improvements, but the workmanship was very shoddy and unprofessional. The tile in the bathroom was only 1/2 grouted. The shower faucet was hanging by a screw coming out of the wall. Dried paint was all over the bathroom floor where they painted the walls after laying the tile--without covering it--or cleaning up after. Ceiling texture was all over the light fixtures and mirrors. Lighting in hallways was dark and scary."
"4977",5,"I've stayed here a couple times and have been impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel and the friendly staff. I've stayed in many comparable smaller town hotels and the Fort Morgan Comfort Inn beats them all hands down."

"4985",3,"Definitely not worthy for over 500 pernight with additional 35 parking . The room is small and the offer is limited. The location is great thought , just right across street from the pier ."

Normally charges are taken out day you leave but they took them out day I arrived then charged 76 extra just incase I broke or damaged something-they said I would get it back but it was still pended out of my account. Good: Loved the free breakfast"

"4993",3,"This hotel is located within walking distance of downtown Gatlinburg. The room is very nice for the price we paid.

"4994",4,"Very enjoyable, staff was polite and helpful"
"4995",4,"We chose this hotel based on the price and location. It certainly lived up to our expectations. It was by far the best value for money I could find with most other hotels almost double. Given we would be out and about most days we just wanted something decent we could get a good sleep in and was clean.River Hotel check in was quick and easy. After a long flight we asked for a quiet room that had a great view when we woke up.We got a room with a view of the alley way and some kind of air con vents outside (1011). Whatever the air con thing was outside had a constant hum and it would drive anyone crazy.The air con in the room was the only thing noisier! Impossible to sleep with it on even with the supplied ear plugs. It's not the city noise that's the problem it's these two things.We loved the free filtered water and bottles.So overall looking back on this trip I think the value and location win out ever so slightly. Maybe a different room would make a difference to this review overall of the hotel."
"4996",5,"This was the most charming hotel we have stayed at in a long time. The rooms were huge and with a fireplace and a couple chairs- so comfy and clean.

"5001",4,"Upon arrival we were greeted at the check in desk. He was very friendly and didn't waste anytime getting us on our way. We stayed on the 7th floor. The room was more like a suite. It had a king size bed and a sitting area that converted to a bed as well. The window overlooked the harbor in the distance and had a ceiling to floor window. Very modern room and hotel. Our room had a door, that conjoined to the neighboring room...this was the only flaw. I'm unsure if it was because of the conjoining door or thin walls, but we could hear everything they said and was a bit uneasy knowing they could hear us too. The hotel offers a continental breakfast. It was mediocre, like they all are. The setup was very nice and very clean. We didn't park at the hotel, 35 a night, instead we parked at the rear of the hotel. It was 3 a night in the public parking garage. This hotel is walking distance to Fells Point, Harbor East, Little Italy, and Inner Harbor. It is also under a 10 cab ride to Power Plant."
"5002",3,"The hotel was just okay. They are under construction and the location has quite a bit of road noise. The room I was in had and older bed and the bathroom could have used some updating. One good thing was the bathroom was clean."

An all-around pleasant hotel stay."
"5006",5,"My husband and I attended the Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg. This was the second time we stayed in this hotel. The rooms are clean and attractively decorated. The staff are friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed the restaurant and lounge for breakfast and dinner. The staff here were also friendly. Both meals were reasonable in price."
"5007",5,"Staff was friendly... Clean room... great location... will definitely stay again. Right by the Superdome.. Not far from everything else. No ice machine on your floor but staff brings ice to ur room quickly. Again great stay."
"5008",5,"Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system. We almost missed our flight due to being unable to leave the lot. Security had to be called and that person told us that there have been a large number of similar episodes. They need to FIX this!. Good: Everything EXCEPT the parking."
"5009",5,"Convenient location. One exit away from many restaurants. The staff was very attentive to address any issues. The lobby and breakfast area was very nice and inviting. Beds were extremely cosy and there are rooms that connect for big families."
"5010",4,"my husband and I went there to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and was very impressed by the beauty of the lobby. But upon the first day of our 5 day stay we encountered numerous teens there for some convention they had there, and on the second day we tried to make reservations at the seafood restuarant on the premises and... More"
"5011",2,"Our first impression was that the hotel was just run down. Our room had broken furniture, disintegrating drywall and wood, an air conditioner that left a growing shopping wet puddle and beds a pillows that no one would find comfortable. The continental breakfast consisted of slices of bread, waffles, bagels, fruit loops and apples. To bad for you if you are gluten intolerant or just want some protein for breakfast. The free shuttle only picked up twice a day and would leave on our before the scheduled time so you had better be there early. You still might not get on, because it's just a large van and they had to call a second shuttle for you to wait for. The hotel staff could be rude and curt or helpful and curt, it's a roulette. By the end of our stay the maids didn't seem to care. They just threw the covers on no matter what was under them and didn't bother to clean. Since it's just a place to lay down after the amusement parks I guess if serves is purpose."

"5015",1,"The best part of the stay at Metro Points besides check out was the staff. I commend them for working in such deplorable conditions. I was extremely disappointed. From the outside, peering through the window, the hotel is beautiful. When I entered I was met by stained carpet and dirty walls. Although check in was easy (Kudos to Mr. Davis) who worked hard to accommodate me. However, he could not fix the peeling paint, the spotty drapes, the snowy picture, the no wifi the entire time I was there, the sink with no running water and the tub with no knobs. This hotel has the potential to be very good. Management cannot be oblivious to all the defects. Management needs to get it together. It's the little things that keep customers or drive them away. I drove away with no intention of ever returning."

"5021",5,"This hotel was great. The staff was genuinely nice and helpful. My boyfriend and I came for a trip to the Verizon Center to catch a Wizards game. The Verizon Center was not far at all. I called front desk for a cab and had one in about 5 minutes. The room was clean and nice. I'm a bit of a germaphobic and I had no problem with it. I didn't spot one dirty spot or anything. When we first got in the room there was a problem with the heat. Maintenance came and fixed it quickly and all was well. If I had to list one improvement it would be that the furniture looks a little outdated. But it was not really a problem. It didn't look dirty or run down, just not fashionable. Other than that, this hotel was wonderful. It was in a great location to restaurants and DC and I would absolutely stay here again."
"5022",4,"My husband, baby daughter and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. You are in a great location near all the restaurants and shops and you cannot beat the price! The beds were not the best quality but were comfortable. I liked the fact there was a microwave and mini fridge in the room. It is not the fanciest hotel to stay in but it met our immediate needs and was very accomodating for a weekend trip getaway with my family. The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and courteous too. When we return to the area we will come back to this hotel."

Thanks to Expedia for allowing us to book this trip on line from the comfort of her own home. Mahalo"

"5026",4,"We checked in and left the Econo Lodge down the road, and found a room at Best Western. Much better room, and much better area for dogs. The Econo had a high TripAdvisor rating, but it was a shabby place with a strip of grass for dogs. The grass was full of fire ants too."
"5027",1,"This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The rooms where not clean. The showers did not work well( went from hot to cold, then hot then cold) I had to unplug the tv to plug in the microwave because they did not accommodate for both. Just an unpleasent experience. Certainly wasn't worth the price ."

"5032",5,"Bad: Nothing. Good: The hotel was simply excellent. The coolest hotel I have ever stayed!"
"5033",5,"Bad: I can't think of anything. Good: The hotel was less than 1/2 mile to the strip (an easy 10 minute walk), which allowed me to be close enough to take advantage of it, but far enough removed to get away from the mega-ness of it. Check-in was easy, the staff was friendly and helpful, the size of the room was pretty standard (which is all I wanted or needed), the bathroom was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was comfortable."

"5037",4,"This hotel provided a stimulated experience with the abundance of local art on display. Pool was wonderful despite the shallow depth (4 feet). I was also amazed at how quiet it was given all of the negative review I read prior concerning noise levels. Hotel is immaculate, surrounded by nice eateries, coffee shops, and bars. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Overall, I had a great time. I like the new artsy vibe in downtown AZ. The only issues we experienced were 1) Bathroom sink kept clogging at night. 2) There are no hooks in the bathroom to hang towels (this we found quite annoying and odd).Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We're bummed we missed the mark in a couple of areas. Our engineering team has actually been going floor by floor to install the bathroom hooks over the past week and are still working on them. Hopefully, next time you visit you'll have them to use. As far as the bathroom sink, we will certainly have someone fix it!"
"5038",5,"This hotel was fabulous. The staff is very much customer service centric. They made my stay better. The rooms are nice and WiFi reliable. They offered great places to visit and eat while there. This hotel is not pricey and HIGHLY recommended."
"5039",5,"Very convenient location. Hotel very convenient for traveling in New York City. Recently renovated, very comfortable and clean beds, modern furnishings (LCD TVs), granite counter tops in bathrooms. Good price too! Taking the bus from New York City to the hotel takes only 15 minutes. The commute in can be a little longer, up to an hour, so leave lots of extra time traveling into NYC. The Wal-Mart next to the hotel was very convenient for last minute things. Would return next time I go to NYC. The hotel restaurant never seemed to be busy though, even at night."

A bit of road noise.The 'Manager's Reception' features plenty of drinks, and some food, but not really dinner. Good exercise room. Breakfasts are excellent, but start at 6 so not good for very early flights. Watch out for all the kids. The place was overrun with them when I was there."
"5042",5,"The new Best Western Plus motels are my favorite! Modern decor... Very clean... Your normal free breakfast. They seem to be even better quality then some holiday Inn expresses. Highly recommend, it was a real treat."
"5043",5,"Place is outstanding!! The people here treat you like gold!! I was very happy with our entire experience here! Karl did an awesome job setting everything up for us every time we came to the beach! No matter what we needed, he was there. Very helpful and outstanding customer service.

"5048",4,"Bad: Nc. Good: GReat beds!"
"5049",3,"The stay was adequate but the hotel was dark inside. First thing that hit us when entering the room was a strong odor of some sort of freshener. When going over the essentials, it did not have any toothpaste. Although the staff is very nice, we requested toothpaste 4 times within 3 hours before it was finally delivered. Still, the stay was adequate for the price we paid in this area."
"5050",5,"Good: All the staff was genuinely friendly."
"5051",4,"Was visiting DC and the hotel was conveniently close to metro, with a shuttle service to get you there. Continental breakfast was great. All the staff were very friendly and helpful."

Very nice lobby, only two clerks for check in at 5:00 on a Saturday.  In the future I'll stay downtown or somewhere else.  Disappointed that Wi-Fi and parking were so expensive.  The parking garage two blocks away was free though."

A very nice rooftop bar but there are times this place gets too busy for the number of employees, so services gets a 7 (from 1-10) Good value on alcohol.The breakfast service is super good, the have a buffet style and fresh omelette's made to order. Must say this hotel does not really cater to the business traveler, no comfortable desk area in room, no place to make a few copies (i.e. business center) For a vacationer this is super great place, clean, location and good staff.Thank you for taking the time to share this review of your stay and for providing this feedback.

All we needed or our two night stay. Area directly surrounding hotel a little hard to navigate and not a lot of choices. Couple of nice eateries within 5 min walk."
"5058",5,"Everyone there is very friendly, accommodating and helpful. Hidden behind Holiday Inn, it's very much worth the stay. This is the 3rd or 4th time we have used this hotel and will continue to. Never had a problem here and continental breakfast offers a huge variety."
"5059",5,"Good: We loved our stay at this hotel. All the staff specially the people in the front desk were extremely nice. Our room was very clean. Bed was really comfortable. The pool area was very relaxing. We had the hotel breakfast twice and both days it was fresh and tasty. We were also able to see magic kingdoms fire work show from the outside of our room because it was facing the park."

"5065",4,"Everything was great except when we discovered that the cleaning person was putting back dirty towels we placed on the floor, back on the rack. Now I questioned if the bed linens and anything else was actually cleaned. We are deeply disappointed that she would do such a mean and unsanitary act. overall, the other staff were helpful and pleasant."

"5068",3,"A friend and I decided to stay at this hotel and though we chose for the price we were disappointed in the fact there are no fridges to put food in if we went out to dinner. We were also expecting hot water for much longer but we made what we got work."
"5069",4,"We stayed here last year about this time to catch an early flight out of Pittsburgh. You can tell that the hotel is in the process of being renovated. Our room was done and looked great. The outside of the hotel was also being painted. The shuttle driver told us that the hotel was recently under new management and a lot of items that were left by the former management is now getting done."
"5070",4,"This is a lovely hotel where one is made to feel very welcome. An extra bonus (for cat lovers, at least) is Claire, the resident cat. The hotel is ideally located for exploring the utterly charming French Quarter. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable but as this is an old building, it is not very soundproof and other guests talking in the courtyard and entryway and wheeling their luggage around disturbed us early each morning - at 4am during the first night. The Frette linens and Molton Brown toiletries were much appreciated luxury touches. We were however disappointed by the breakfast - we ordered toast in preference to biscuits and one slice of toast each seemed rather meagre. Be warned - the coffee is flavoured with chicory - a New Orleans tradition but not to our taste. I would recommend this as a place to stay if you are happy to put up with the quirks of an old building but suggest eating breakfast elsewhere.We usually do have pure coffee in the freezer. We don't get many requests but we try to stay prepared. You simply needed to request it. I doubt that anyone could find breakfast spots in New Orleans that serve pure coffee. New Orleans traditional caf au lait is French roasted chicory coffee served with an equal part of warm milk. That is what we serve. That is what Caf du Monde serves. We are famous for our buttermilk biscuits but we do keep gluten free and whole grain bread for the guests who don't eat white flour. I do apologize that you were served only two slices of toast. An order of biscuits if four therefore an order of toast should also be at least four.Please if your travels bring you back to New Orleans give us another try. In addition to the tea , hot chocolate and iced coffee that are always available we will brew pure for you each morning. We will also give you a room on the second or third floor or even on the other side of the street so if we have late arrivals or early departures you won't be disturbed.Claire would be disappointed if you went elsewhere and so would I"

"5075",3,"This hotel is fine. The room was nice and the lobby clean. The buffet was good. My problem is you pay a premium for this hotel due to the location and it really isnt' worth the money., in my opinion. Stay at a hotel farther out and take the public transport system. Our one night stay for a basic room with a king bed was 345. Also, they give you ear plugs on your nightstand. Not a good sign. Bring a noise maker to drown out the noise.Dear TinasB3116Mo,Thank you very much for taking the time to review our hotel and share your stay with us. I very much appreciate the feedback and sorry to hear that you felt the cost did not match the experience of being at the heart of Seattle across the street from Space Needle. Our prices do very through out the year and often are much lower. Also if you are a World of Hyatt member and book directly with Hyatt.com you can save an additional 10 off.I hope you do keep us in mind the next time you are in the Seattle area. We would love to host you again! Most Sincerely,Jonathan"

There is nothing much right next to the hotel. Breakfast, checkin, checkout and the reception staff were all good. Breakfast staff could have been a bit more courteous."

"5085",4,"The hotel is clean and pretty much up-to-date. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The annoying thing sometimes can be that the heating or a/c can be really noisy. The trick is to heat/cool up your room enough during the day time so that you can shut it completely down during the night."
"5086",4,"This was our second stay at this location. We returned because we were impressed with the staff's attitude of extra mile service. We appreciate the Residence Inn's stocked kitchenette for when we just wanted to stay in, but the complimentary breakfast was a welcome option.

He not only arranged our chairs and umbrellas by the beach but he also positioned the cushions and towels so that we were as comfortable as possible. He was amazing!"
"5093",4,"In town for the US Open it was a bit noisy the night the Penguins won the cup but it was a comfortable room with quick room service. The only negative was I had waived room service for the first day and the maid service never showed up all week- i had to call to get them to clean."
"5094",5,"We picked this hotel because it was halfway between Tampa and Miami. The front desk staff is so nice and helpful. They answered every question and even came and cleaned our room when housekeeping missed us. The cookies after 6 p.m. in the lobby are essential. Great stay"

"5101",4,"We loved our stay here. Our favorite is Miss Domi who is so friendly and greeting everyone with her sweet smile. The only downside is the bathtub.

"5102",4,"We chose Aloft because we were able to use our credit card points towards our stay and it was the closest and cheapest we could find the French Quarter. With that being said we are happy with our choice. When we first arrived we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff Jermal was great. We got to our room on the 12th floor and were happy with the amenities. The room was not as large as I would have thought, but it was comfortable and a non issue since we spent minimal time in the room. There was a coffee pot, a mini fridge, and lots of mirror space. Our view overlooked the Ritz Carlton and we were able to see their pool and patio area- pretty cool. The beds are comfortable and the towels didn't feel like sandpaper. They provide Bliss toiletries which was fine, however, I did not pack shampoo or conditioner and they offered a shampoo conditioner all-in-one which I did not care for (but my husband loved...). The vanity area has intense lighting good for makeup application!The lobby area is very nice and fun. They have a snack area for any cravings you have when you are there- premade salads sandwiches, candy, chips, fruit, yogurt, beer, juice, pop, etc. The lobby bar is very nice- good drinks and a fun environment. Lots of games and fun dcor. LaKisha (I hope I spelled that right!) was very friendly and did a great job. They do offer a pool table and computers/printer which came in handy to quickly print our boarding passes. The only issues we ran into was the room service for our room, they did the bare minimum in cleaning our room. The bed was always made, toiletries and towels were always replaced, however, that was about it. No trash was picked up and nothing was organized. When you go to a hotel, typically they neatly arrange your items so they can clean the room/bathroom/vanity completely, but this was not the case. Our toiletries were shoved to a corner or moved over so they could place new toiletries, I had a half eaten sandwich placed on a shelf instead of being thrown away, the coffee pot wasn't put back or the coffee replenished (but new coffee cups were given), whatever was left on the bed was thrown back on it, there was a bottle cap left on the floor... small things that added up. This wasn't huge issue, but enough of one to notice and let the front desk know as we checked out. Also, the elevator functioned oddly for my husband once. He was brought to the top floor and then back down to the lobby instead of being brought to our floor.. but that was not a huge deal.. just odd!Our friends who were staying on the 11th floor experienced some poor water pressure and cold water, however, we did not.The hotel is in a good location- two blocks from Canal and two blocks up from Bourbon- easy walking! The valet out from was super helpful when we were getting ready to leave by reserving us a taxi so we did not have to wait when we wanted one and put our items in the vehicle while we were checking out to make the process smooth and efficient. All in all, the hotel was a great choice and we'd recommend and stay there again. For being brand new, they did a great job!Fantastic! Thank you for your feedback, with us being a new property, reviewers like yourself help us get better! We are thrilled that you liked the property and all of the outlets like our WXYZ Bar and Re:fuel pantry. We cant wait to have you back here with us again soon.We truly appreciate your review and thank you again for staying with aloftnola.- Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager"
"5103",5,"This motel was close to the airport and only a short drive from a shopping mall and many fine restaurants. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The whole facility was very well kept and having cold, fruit flavored water available in the lobby was very refreshing in hot July. We would certainly stay here again."
"5104",2,"I was so disappointed in this property! Threadbare, torn carpet, no guest services until 6am, dingy outside. I didn't feel comfortable the entire time I was there. Does not look anything like the photos posted. Until they do a major renovation, find another place to stay."
"5105",1,"This was the dirtiest and worst run hotel we've ever stayed in. It was so dirty we had to leave early and find alternative accommodation. Sticky carpets, dirty linen AC and fridge not working. Changed rooms but no improvement - no way could this be a 3 star hotel"

"5107",4,"Close to Midway airport, great shuttle service, good interiors for the price. Would readily stay again."
"5108",3,"IF your looking for an affordable place close to DC this is the perfect place. It was convenient with 2 children to have a kitchen and a little extra room. The hotel offers a shuttle to the metro station but we found the walk to be pleasant and only 10 minutes away. There aren't any restaurants nearby so you either have to plan in advance or order food to be delivered. Another added benefit is the free parking, and plenty of it. I would probably stay again, if only for the location."
"5109",5,"Everything was great from beginning to end! Check out went smoothly, and the staff was friendly! Our room was absolutely amazing! There was a balcony that overlooked the ocean! It was incredible. The beds were comfy and the room was clean. The restaurant downstairs gave hubby and I free Shirley temples! I loved it and wished I could have stayed longer to fully take advantage of the amenities. I will definitely be back!!!!"

"5118",3,"There were stink bugs on the curtains! The front desk was somewhat quick to come remove one or two. But by the end of the night, I had removed three myself. The complimentary breakfast was typical, although I would have enjoyed some toppings for the oatmeal. No one bothered to clear the entrance/exit driveway, which is a steep hill, after 6 inches of snow. There was no other hotel close enough to move to, as I was there for business."

"5120",5,"I had a change of plans in my day and went in to check in at 11am or a little after so I wouldn't have to at 2am. The front desk staff was very accommodating and allowed me to with no hesitation. Room was very clean."

"5124",4,"Appreciated the shuttle service! Very friendly staff."
"5125",5,"I've stayed at this hotel before and was pleased when Hotels.com again offered it at such a reasonable price. The hotel van comes promptly to the airport, check in was speedy and the room was clean and welcoming. The one issue was that I arrived at the hotel tired in the middle of the afternoon and the pool did not open until 6 PM. I get that they mostly get traveling businessmen but having the pool available in the afternoons would be a great advantage to work off some sore muscles and traveling frustration. Hotel itself though is great."

If you are going to Chicago to shop, sight see, or hit a few wonderful restaurants and want a clean, well maintained hotel where you can sleep peacefully- this is your place. The price is great for what you get. There are few frills, but the accommodations are very reasonable in terms of function and comfort. The perks:- Great location! Close to shopping, parks, restaurants, Navy Pier and most downtown sights.- In and out valet parking for a reasonable Chicago price (52/day). You can find cheaper parking nearby, but not with in and out options.- Complimentary ater bottles and purified water on all floors.-Lounge with complimentary snacks, coffee, tea, and soda open for much of the day.- Wine in the Lobby in the evening.- Responsive, kind staff.-Free high speed internet is high speed enough for most purposes.The less fabulous aspects:-Rooms are small or sparsely decorated. The rooms serve as a clean, functional space. There are no bathtubs, only showers. You get a a couch, TV, mini fridge and desk if you upgrade to a queen suite.-Matrresses are firm...not so firm those of us who prefer softer beds can not sleep, but firm.- Valet was understaffed for our visit with only one attendant even during busier times. It did take 20 minutes to get our car when requested.- The cable is not top quality and goes out or the stream gets paused often."
"5128",5,"The room was very nice, the A/C was phenominal in the room, a quiet and pleasant stay. The staff was very nice. The only downside of the stay was the internet cut in and out through the day. Overall, great experience!"
"5129",4,"There was no guide in the room (the book that outlines amenities, important locations, area restaurants, etc) and I found the wireless to be quite slow. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean. Breakfast was tasty."
"5130",5,"My family and I enjoyed the cleanliness of the hotel, friendliness of the staff, and convenience of its location. We always stay at Hampton hotels because of their cleanliness and dependable service! We highly recommend the Erie, PA Hampton Inn."
"5131",3,"I made a reservation through Expedia. I'd read an article saying that all the rooms had been refurbished, so I thought I was OK. A day before our stay I looked at the Alamo's web site, which advised that one needs to call the motel to get a refurbished room. I tried calling them over the course of 4 hours... More"

"5136",5,"Such a good trip. Being there with my fiancee to enjoy a little getaway for the weekend was perfect. We couldn't believe the view. The sunset was phenomenal and you can't imagine the sunrise. I just wish we were able to have free-wifi. Sucks to pay but they want to make a profit right Other than that the amenities sounded so great. A free bike, shuttle to downtown, and 24 hour pool. I guess that's where the extra income from the paid wifi goes too Whatever. It was sweet. We loved it and loved how friendly the staff was. They truly care about you and are always ready to help."
"5137",4,"This hotel is right on the river, which probably makes it the best one in Yuma.

Hotel was recently redone and is much nicer than some of the higher priced hotels along beach front. You get to control your a/c. I wish we had stayed here for the entire stay. The neighborhood has great little pubs and small shops and restaurants that you might want to check out as well."

"5160",5,"Wonderful! Especial nice for persons traveling with pets!"
"5161",4,"We only stayed one night, but we can see why it would be good for an extended stay. The room had a small kitchen and work area. We prefer to stay at hotels that offer a full breakfast, which this one didn't but that was okay, we just went to the Waffle House down the street. This is not a complaint by the way. We were mainly looking for a hotel close to Interstate 64 for one night and the lack of a full breakfast was not a big deal to us. The staff were friendly and courteous and the room was clean and adequate for our needs. We would stay here again if we are ever in the area."

"5182",5,"We had a great time. When I booked the Hotel I booked it for the inside pool for Spring Break for my grandchildren. I didn't even realize all the other perks of this hotel for kids. Inside pool, inside playground, inside game room and mini golf. I would totally stay here again for kids it was great."
"5183",5,"The staff was top notch. From the desk manager to the cleaning ladies everyone was friendly and eager to help. Great attitudes. The WiFi was slow and eventually just turned back to 4G.

"5209",2,"Clean hotel but the noise and vibrations from people walking outside to the bathroom fans in other rooms reverberated right through the bed. very poor insulation.

Great breakfast with lots of variety. Nice to have the shuttle even though there were limited times. We took it when we could other wise just used uber which was not really a problem for us. The room also had a little fridge and microwave which was great for storing and having snacks."

The mattress on our bed was lumpy and needs replacing. As a hotel that allows pets, they should do a better job of cleaning the rooms. I love dogs, but am very allergic to... More"
"5223",2,"The grout in the bathroom was filthy,  the rooms are out dated.  The noise we got being on the 39th floor must have been from poor insulated glass.  We could hear the cars driving.  The bed wall was aginst the two elevators running up and down all night.  The breeze way running to the vehicle garage was being used as the smoking area buy the staff.  It was suffocating coming in and out of the building.  The only time we ate there was first day in the morning.   The buffet was horrible.  The bacon was rock hard,  the powdered eggs tasted like caulk, the ham was nothing but grease.  Very unhappy with the meal.  And to top it off it cost $35.00 for two of us.  I had continental breakfast that had more to offer, and alot better taste. Adding the 34.00 for car parking,  the horrible breakfast,  and two nights of restless sleep.   It cost me 700.00.  This is a very unsatisfied customer that will post to other trends to let people know that this is hotel shouldn't even have a rating."

The room was absolutely depressing. Desperate need of updating. Walls were cracked and dirty. The bathroom had fixtures... More"
"5235",2,"The hotel is listed as near Bricktown. I guess that would depend on your definition of near. Near to me would be near the Pilot truckstop as it was next door. Our room was clean, but you could walk to the pool an see other rooms that were not. Many had mattresses propped up against the wall, and almost all the second floor rooms had pillows stuffed in the a/c units. You could see all this through the windows of the parking lot because lots of the sliding glass door curtains were open or missing pieces. It honestly looked like they were fixing it one room at a time. I don't know how old the hotel is, but it is far from being completely renovated. I think hotels.com should do more research on the hotels they show with a 4 star rating. The two star the hotel showed was more accurate."
"5236",5,"This was a very nice Hampton Inn. Lobby area is very nice. Negatives- Breakfast is very busy. Not enough seating. Food is just OK. Our room did not get cleaned until after 5PM. We just got back from all day wine tasting. Maids did not knock they just walked in."
"5237",4,"Service is great, Charles is awesome, he goes above and beyond to take care of us. Everyone, actually, was very friendly and very helpful. The only two things we didn't like was the room had a horrible view, and the pillows were so soft that they didn't provide any support, and that made sleep not very comfortable."
"5238",3,"First come first serve basis should be put in effect. Rooms were assigned before guests checked in and prevented me from getting a much wanted side of the hotel. Curtain change is very much needed in room 224. It's got a big window with very thin, net looking curtain that will not block the sunlight in the morning."
"5239",5,"Very comfortable beds, nice linens. We used the mini refrig for cold waters and drinks. Great Breakfasts!! Friendly, helpful staff."
"5240",5,"Came down for Valentine's day for a little vacation and enjoyed every second. Bed was very comfortable and the room was nice and big for our 4 night stay."
"5241",4,"Fun time and very relaxing. Breakfast was pretty good also."
"5242",4,"The hotel is located within walking distance from the main street of the island which is right on the beach. The island experience should not be missed! You won't believe you are in the United States. The hotel rooms are pretty good and clean. Everyone is extremely nice and the owner even drove us to the ferry boat! There are... More"
"5243",5,"From check in through check out, EVERYTHING about this hotel was amazing!! The facilities and rooms were better than the internet pictures...... The staff was very helpful and did what ever it took to make us happy and the price was very favorable!! If I ever need a hotel again, anywhere near Harrisburg... I will definitely be staying here."
"5244",5,"Bad: View. We had a view of an alley. But, that's the only downside. Good: Staff was extremely helpful. Rooms were well-appointed, clean and functional."
"5245",4,"My first time staying at a Best Western Plus and I was pleasantly surprised. The employees here are great and genuinely nice people always willing to assist. The rooms were clean and well kept and nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms spacious and clean. It was also very convenient to have a Denny's restaurant within the hotel. The location of this hotel is also very good and on a main road with many shops and dining options. This place is good for an affordable family trip without sacrificing on quality.Jorge,Thank you for the great review. We are always looking at being very competitively price and to give our guest the best accommodations for the price in Napa. We will see you on your next trip to Napa."
"5246",5,"The owner of The Hotel Storyville went above and beyond to help us put on a birthday party in the garden. The evening was a great success. The rooms were clean and well-furnished, and the location can't be beat."
"5247",1,"There was a restaurant charge on my invoice for 139.00 and I contacted the front desk to notify them that I did not eat at their restaurant, charge a meal to my room or order room service so obviously someone used by credit card info on file to charge a meal. The person working the front desk was dismissive and rude and just said We'll look it to it. I told him that was not good enough I wanted to know if my charge info and identity was compromised so I could notify my bank. I'll cut to chase he was no help. I asked to speak to a manage but I was told there was not manager on duty so two hours later I finally spoke to a manager Jim who told me the charges would be reversed in 3 days...I still don't know if my personal info has been compromised and I have to monitor my account everyday and the charges have still not been reversed. Terrible customer service. Bob"
"5248",5,"It was great room was very nice n they treated me like a vip"
"5249",5,"Nice room overlooking the street and the river. Wonderful breakfasts as well."
"5250",5,"Great Experience considering the horrible weather we were having. The staff was exceptionally nice and friendly. Breakfast was very good and the location in all was very clean."
"5251",4,"The hotel is older but it is clean and the staff were very friendly. We arrived late after travelling for many hours and they were friendly and quick to get us into a room. They kept the pool open an extra half hour so our daughter could swim, which was a huge bonus to an 11 year old."
"5252",5,"I am sitting in my room at the Suncoast as I write this reveiw to you, via high speed internet service provided by the hotel at a 9.99 fee. ( a bargin since I probably saved 100 over the 24 hour period, by using my computer instead of gambling!!)Trip advisor is my travelers bible. I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try.We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28.Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about.The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds)We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers.The buffet was wonderful.We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!"
"5253",5,"Will always stay here when we're in that area"
"5254",1,"Overall miserable experience. Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location. Manager had a very confrontational attitude and certainly does not treat her guest like I am accustom at other higher end Hilton properties. She certainly makes it clear your word isn't good enough unless she can see the messed up room details for herself.... More"
"5255",2,"We have always been extremely satisfied with the Holiday Inn Express hotels that we have stayed in in the past, especially the breakfast buffets, and that was why we again chose a Holiday Inn Express when we were passing through the Baltimore area. Were we ever wrong on this one!! The buffet was very limited, hardly any hot items and what was supposed to be hot was actually stone cold (i.e. the gravy for the biscuits). The biscuits were rock hard. The scrambled eggs were a very bad version of imitation. Seemed like the person running the buffet was using week old biscuits and figured the warming lamps would heat up the gravy so she did not have to. I have never had a worse breakfast anywhere. If you are planning on getting your fill at this buffet - forget it. We had to go out to breakfast after checking out just to keep from starving. We hadn't balked at the room fee because we assumed the buffet would be worth the extra money - Boy were we wrong!!"
"5256",4,"Historic. Clean and comfortable. Staff friendly and quick to respond about lamp not working. Breakfast buffet- had choice of make own waffles, eggs, turkey sausage, biscuits and no meat gravy, and typical fruits, cereal, etc. Would stay again"
"5257",5,"Bad: Nothing. Good: The location was perfect!!! The hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly. We highly recommend this hotel."
"5258",3,"We were pleased with our stay, for the most part. The carpeting in the hallway seemed kinda dirty, but our room was clean. I didn't like that breakfast was only until 9 am. And the breakfast hostess, who was very nice, started taking it all down at 8:50. She did tell someone if they wanted yogurt, she would go in the back and get it. But I felt like I had to rush through breakfast."
"5259",3,"it's was alright the vent leaked water, there was a lot of cold air from the sliding door. no extras just alright, I won't stay again"
"5260",5,"One night stay before flight home. All we needed and with a 12 noon check out - good room, clean comfortable.

"5263",5,"My wife and I stayed here for the first three nights of our honeymoon and had a great time. The hotel has a lot of character and history which we felt made the experience that much more unique. And the lobby bar was magical."
"5264",5,"We stayed at the Honua Kai in 2012 and although it has increased in price significantly it is still an amazing place. Went through VBRO and rented which was cheaper than on the hotel site. Really not a bad room the sun rises over the mountains and sets right out front. It has everything you need beautiful pools, well cleaned,... More"
"5265",4,"Check in kid was motivated and high energy. while this sounds stupid I found it entertaining and welcoming."
"5266",4,"Hotel stay was great! Good service and customer care as always! The live concert by river was enjoyable. Happy hour on patio at Colorado Belle was awesome. I really enjoy the 5 blackjack two deck tables."
"5267",3,"This is a budget hotel which has been recently remodeled. No frills, small but clean and neat. We had a king size bed which had the most comfortable mattress of our entire trip! The sheets were crisp and clean, so relaxing after a long day of activities. The area was quiet and we had no safety issues. There is coffee in the lobby which was good. No other food or drink except vending machines, but numerous eating choices on the same street. There is no elevator, but we had a ground floor room, so this wasn't an issue for us. Overall a good value if you are just looking for a place to sleep. We would definitely stay there again."
"5268",4,"The room was basic but clean and comfortable. I asked for a ground level room because I have a bad knee and would've had difficulty with stairs, especially taking my dogs out. The lady in the office had to do some reshuffling in order to accommodate me, which she did cheerfully even though it was more work for her, and... More"

"5270",3,"We decided Saturday morning to go to A.C. for the night (from North Jersey)... looked online for a hotel that was reasonably close to boardwalk and casinos and priced below saturday night casino rates... this hotel fit that criteria... 2 blocks from boardwalk... essentially between resorts and ballys... good location (although other reviews are right about strip bars on street between boardwalk and hotel)... hotel is older and no frills - but clean, comfortable (air conditioner in our 4th floor room worked great), and certainly adequate... i would certainly recommend this hotel as a reasonably priced place to spend an overnight"

In many ways its the same stylish, chic and not quite up to snuff on service (the exception being the front of the house which is very good). I would say that LWH... More"
"5275",5,"This hotel has a lot to offer at a good value. The suite was spacious for the price. It offered a separate BR from the tv watching area and desk. It had two televisions, a fridge and microwave. The staff were courteous and friendly to a fault. This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. As to the extras - the hotel offered on site parking in their private garage. There was a great complimentary breakfast each morning, offering every conceivable food. Last, there was a 3 hour happy hour that offered free drinks (adult beverages as well!) and snacks - daily! This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. We would, absolutely, stay here again!"
"5276",5,"Fantastic - ease of travel convenience, location with respect to attending events (easy access to Metro), great bar at the hotel. I cannot think of a single negative and will stay there anytime I travel to D.C."
"5277",5,"As soon as I walked into the hotel I was greeted with smiles from the front desk staff along with a warm, welcome to our property.

"5279",2,"We made reservations on November 9, 2011 for a stay on the night of May 16, 2012 and specifically asked for a non-smoking room. When we arrived at 11 p.m., the desk clerk casually told us the only room left was a smoking room. No explanation as to what had happen to our reservation for a non-smoking room. No apology. She couldn't have cared less. The smell that greeted us when we opened the door to the room was unbelievable. I slept with a clean towel on my pillow to avoid the tobacco smell that permeated every inch of the room. Not going back there anytime soon."
"5280",2,"The hotel was very unclean and the staff acted as if it was a chore to do their job. I had items let in my room from previous consumers. My room had cob webs in the ceiling and the bathroom was dirty. I spoke with the front desk and she was very nanchalant, telling me someone would call be back but to this day no one called me back. My car almost got towed because the front desk person forgot to give me a parking pass to park on hotel property. I had to rushout to speak with the tow truck gentleman, then she gently said O i'm sorry, I forgot"

Because room was left very clean . We only took a shower and slept we didn't even use anything else in are room. All towels were left in bathroom in a pile after we used them bed was clean .

Arrived back at hotel at 6PM last day of stay and room was being cleaned - unacceptable! We went to the front desk to complain and were offered free drinks at Monkey Board and reassured would be completed soon as well as told that hotel was full - that was why cleaning being done so late - not the customer's issue at all and should not be used as an excuse. Major inconvenience as we had been at French Quarter Fest all day and were planning to rest a little before getting ready for dinner. Also, elevator setup is less than optimal. Big line in lobby to get up to bar interfering with guests trying to get to rooms. Also, didn't seem to be separate service elevator from guest elevator - another dissatisfier. Nice looking hotel - rooms were actually very nice looking/well designed and decent location but really need to get the service kinks out before I would recommend to others and/or return. Lots of other great choices in NOLA....Thank you for your comments Josh, I'm very disappointed to read we didn't exceed your expectations. Your concerns have been shared with my Front Office Manager and Director of Housekeeping so that we can improve. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience and know that we can do much better.

"5300",5,"Bad: There wasn't anything I didn't like. Good: All staff was very nice and extremely accommodating. The entire property was clean and well kept. The room was clean when we arrived and housekeeping came every morning to clean and verify all was well and if we needed any additional towels, toiletries etc. Their breakfast area was clean, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty food to go around. I read some guests didn't like the breakfast voucher system but my husband and I liked them because we have stayed at other hotels where there is more people in the breakfast area than there is food. Their Wifi went down while at their business center, they informed me that the system was running slow and that their service provider was on property trying to fix it. I let them know that I was in the middle of a Disney ticket purchase and the front desk staff immediately got their own personal Hotspot set up on their front desk computer. They let me finish my Disney ticket purchase/transaction from their desk....yes from their desk... which i didn't expect. I was really happy cause that saved us alot of time and hassle. The hotel is close to WDW and plenty of dinning. It was overall a wonderful stay, nothing to complain about...other that they could accommodate me the extra day we decide to stay, but that was our fault since we did it last minute. Would HIGHLY recommend."

The room was amazing and the best I have ever stayed in, very clean and neat, beds were comfortable, price was great, and the breakfast in the morning was filling and good. I didn't get to use the pool... More"
"5331",1,"Noisy hotel, paper thin walls and not conducive to sleep. We stayed here because it was near the hospital and we heard they offered a special rate for hospital patients. We were not offered a discount rate and got no sleep before surgery either! Hippy dog in halls at 2 am, car traffic late night and early morning, dark surroundings with little security are reasons why we will never stay here again. Also, no smoking room reeked of smoke especially when bathroom fan was turned on. Morning receptionist did nothing to resolve."
"5332",5,"Bad: There's nothing not to like here. Though the maid service was good but they are kind of early to knock at the door for cleaning service. They're there at 8am and we were still in dreamland that we were forced to get up and open the door to talk to them to clean later. Good: We love our very spacious room though we didn't have a single king sized bed. They gave us twin beds but it's fine. The Garden court buffet was also great! It was very affordable. We almost eat there everyday because of its price. Please keep it that way."

"5334",4,"Good: Very friendly staff. Rental of a beach chair and umbrella was included in the room price."
"5335",5,"Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. This hotel has the best redemption for SPG points value, and we took advantage to pamper ourselves. It was really very nice, though one mishap occurred when we were billed for something in the bar that we didn't order. The reception cleared it for us right away without the hassle we may of experienced at some other hotel. We didn't receive the 5th Ave view we were hoping for, but that's only fair when using points. Would definitely stay again.Dear Rose2li, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"

"5338",5,"We stayed over night so we could catch an early flight the next morning. The motel provided transportation to the airport. They were so nice about it! They gave us a free sample beer the night before, and free coffee the next morning. We would have been given breakfast, too, but we had to leave too early."
"5339",2,"The bed in room 305 had to be the worst bed I've ever slept in. NOT HAPPY. not impressed. will not be staying there or will do my best to avoid another holiday inn express."
"5340",4,"We have come to this hotel yearly for 23 years. It's convenient, friendly and has above average amenities. We recommend it especially for families. All rooms are two room suites which gives parents an opportunity to separate awhile from children. All rooms have a view of the Chesapeake Bay and balconies."
"5341",2,"The room was clean and comfortable but the hotel halls etc. were messy and looked liked they werent cleaned on a regular basis. The breakfast was a joke. Three types of sugary cereal, no toast or yogurt."
"5342",4,"I requested a smoking room because my hubby likes cigars and was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the room was! I've stayed in higher-end hotels and the hallways and rooms reeked where smoking was allowed! That was not the case at Extended Stay. Admittedly, it's not the most modern hotel, but it was comfortable, staff was friendly, and it was well-kept. My only minor complaint is that you have to request kitchen amenities. By the time I knew that they weren't in the cabinets, it was late and I didn't feel like bothering to request any."
"5343",5,"Stayed during high season in Phoenix. Not super chi-chi, but super solid. Impeccably clean room, clean lobby, clean grounds. Friendly staff. Cheesecake Factory walking distance a bonus. :-) Easy to get to from Phoenix ingress on Highway 60 from East. Great."
"5344",5,"This was a beautiful hotel with an indoor pool, very comfortable beds and an extensive breakfast buffet. Each of the employees was friendly and helpful. Will stay here again when we are on our way through."

"5346",5,"I love the Best Western Plus product. The rooms are always big and clean.This is my first visit to Napa, the area is beautiful. I picked this locating using my airline discount site which posted good reviews as well.The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We received a 3rd floor room above the lobby which afforded us a great view. Even though our balcony overlooked the road, we never heard any traffic noises. There is plenty of shopping and food options right across the street.We drove to downtown Napa and found plenty of great option for shopping and dining as well. I recommend going down there for good local flavor. I would discourage using your phone as your GPS to get around to various vineyards, we had two different maps going but kept losing our signal. Either bring your Garmen, etc. or ask the rental car agency for one just in case.Thank you for your detailed review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay."
"5347",5,"This hotel is just two block to Bourbon Street and close enough to walk alway to Cafe DuMonde. Safe area. Bed very comfortable and hotel perfectly clean and nice. I will stay here again every time I am in NOLA. LaQuinta rates for Sheraton level hotel. Great value at great prices, what a winner! Thanks so much for staying with us at Aloft New Orleans Downtown and taking the to post your review. Come back soon."
"5348",4,"I love that Denny's is right beside the hotel...that is one of the reasons why my family and I had came back to stay here again on our vacation. I did not like us getting non smoking rooms when I had reserved smoking in the first place. Unpacking in the wrong room then packing up again to move in the right room made me a little upset. Most nights that I had stayed there I couldnt sleep that well because of kids running up and down the hallways and knocking on our doors and running away. I believe the hotel staff should of been montioring the 3rd floors better than they had. The air conditioner did not work at all in room 343 and it got really hot in there.I believe the bathrooms could of been a little more cleaner than what they were. I had asked for a rollaway bed and didnt get one because they were all out. I asked for more pillows and blankets and all they gave me was two blankets. Yes it was pretty close to beach and zoo and all the must see sights. Next summer I plan on coming back to Virginia Beach but I will probably rent a beach house on Sandbridge for a week."

"5359",4,"The room we had was very clean and the hotel is perfect walking distance to everything in Gatlinburg.. Loved the pool and free breakfast as well! They also had free popcorn in the lobby which was very nice. The hotel was better than what I thought it'd be and I recommend to anyone!"

"5361",4,"The front lobby was very welcoming and enjoyable. The pool was beautiful. The rooms were very very clean. Convenience having restaurant on site. Location was great and the price was very reasonable. Would stay there again."

This is an updated hotel that gives a very good first impression when you walk in the door. The rooms don't disappoint. Very affordable too!"
"5365",5,"Beautiful room, ocean view, fridge in room, DVD player, balcony"
"5366",4,"Location was very convenient, although using their free shuttle to Metro Station probably is not that convenient. We just parked at the station for 4.50/day. If you don't have a car, then I think you could make the shuttle work for you, or take a cab. We booked 2 rooms. Cons: Both were very small, with shabby, 80's looking furnishings. Rooms had an unpleasant musty smell that a/c didn't remedy. One room we booked did not have a fridge and microwave although the hotel lists that as an amenity for their rooms. Ice machine only available on 2nd floor. There isn't one on 4th floor and the one on 3rd floor didn't work. Old-style TV's when almost every other hotel in this category has nicer flat screens. Beds, while somewhat comfortable, were made up with not so great linens (thin sheets, old bedspreads). No laundry room, which is only needed for multi-day stays. Pros: Good housekeeping service swimming pool kept very clean with a lifeguard present at all times, towels are sometimes available at the pool EXCELLENT full hot breakfast available with enough options for daily variety for a multi-day stay. All in all, would probably look a little closer at another Springfield, VA lodging option if visiting in the future. Although most of our time spent in a hotel room is simply sleeping or preparing to go out for the day, would prefer to have just a little more elbow room than this hotel offers."
"5367",4,"The room was newly renovated and nice. The staff was helpful and pleasant. Morning breakfast selections cereal, toast, bagels, muffins, eggs, waffles, potatoes O'Brian. Coffee, o.j., milk, tea, hot coco."

"5369",5,"Bad: Had a very frustrating time booking online. The website was not secure. Good: Clean. Very important!"
"5370",5,"The staff was very friendly and helpful. We arrived early and we're check-in with zero issues. The room was bigger than expected and clean. They even shuttled my friends and I around the area. We couldn't ask for a better stay."
"5371",5,"I really enjoyed myself. Great atmosphere, the food was delicious. Bar tender was on point. The patio was so relaxing. I'm planning my get away weekend there. Over all 10. The Soldan's committee couldn't found a better place to have our reunion. Plenty of space. The workers were very helpful. Clean atmosphere."
"5372",5,"We took our two grand children to see DC and stayed at the Embassy because of its convenience to the city. Our grandson has extreme food restrictions due to food alergies so we were not sure how this trip would go. It was his first trip away from home. TWe explained to the chef and server that he needed special food preparation and care. They went far and above to make sure his needs were met and to follow up that he was taken care of. Thanks to these good folks we feel more comfortable about travelling with him. The Embassy staff made this a great summer for our grandson."
"5373",3,"Hesitant to book after reading reviews but turned out good. Staff very nice. Room clean and spacious. Bed was comfortable with clean sheets. Don't know why people complained about the continental breakfast. They had cereal, waffles, muffins, good coffee, juice, etc. in a clean environment. The complainers need to realize this is not a bed breakfast or a gourmet restaurant. Had a first floor room and could hear upstairs foot falls but that is to be expected in any motel. Good thing no noisy people tho. Second night rate (Saturday) was way overpriced for this place. Would recommend if only staying a few days. This motel is just a plain vanilla."
"5374",4,"Came to life in color and they charged me 50 because we got a little paint on the shower curtain on towels. No where else. If there is going to be an event like that within 2 miles of your hotel and you put a special price on your hotel that weekend, you have to expect people who attend the event will go to your hotel. 50 is extravagant for a little paint. Also, no parking garage Or else we couldn't find one and got charged another 50 for a garage down the street for ONE NIGHT."

"5377",5,"Don't believe the negative reviews we stayed at this hotel for four nights and looked forward to coming home each night. My girlfriend used to work at a hotel and she thought the room was typical of hotels costing 50 more a night. Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and free shuttle to the metro, which is half a mile away (takes about 20 mins to ride to Capitol). We heard sounds from neighboring rooms only once, and the noise was faint. Only complaint was the room service - it took 75 minutes to arrive but they gave it to us free. Reading other reviews, we were a little worried about the neighborhood. Don't be. Yes, it's not the best part of town but those who call it a ghetto are way off. We walked to the metro once (and back at night) and we always felt safe. This is a great way to see DC and not spend a ton at a downtown hotel."
"5378",5,"The hotel was great. We drove in and our room was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed room service and the staff was great. Will stay here again when in Suffolk."

"5383",4,"My Dad and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Atlanta for the Chick Fil-A kickoff game between Louisville and Auburn. It was good value for money, with a spacious and comfortable room that was in great shape. The bathroom was spotless and seemed new. Even on the fifth floor, the noise from breakfast diners begins at 7:00 AM and is rather loud in rooms near the atrium, so if you want more quiet, request a room further away."
"5384",4,"The folks here have paid attention to detail and made this a wonderful place to stay. There is Plenty of room for parking, a nice breakfast, comfortable rooms, easy check in and out.

"5391",4,"The breakfast could have been better, I was over charged for parking the first night. The valet staff were very helpful. The room was fine, but a bit cramped for our group."
"5392",5,"FIrst, the young woman who works at the front desk should get a raise. She was one of the most pleasant and helpful hotel employees I have met. She was able to answer every question and didn't seem to mind that we asked the same ones several times. Second, breakfast was wonderful. Finally, location was perfect for the conference we needed to attend the following day. The only reason I rated surrounding neighborhood so low is that the hotel is surrounded by highways, but that adds to its convenience."

"5410",5,"We stayed here for the third time for our 5th anniversary. This hotel is definitely expensive for the area, but well worth the price. It's the kind of place where you want to luxuriate in the hotel itself, not just a bed for the night."
"5411",5,"The property is very attractive inside and out. When the sun came out I noticed flower baskets hanging under the staircase on the main building and some trumpet vine, and fuchsias blooming on the hillside.

We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around. Overall, I definitely recommend Hotel Zelos!"

"5415",3,"Spacious rooms, a lovely bay view and a reasonable price, but there were enough weird things that I won't be back. I did also appreciate the warm indoor pool for my winter visit. Weird things: -The light switch just inside my door did nothing, so I had to cross the room in the dark to turn on a light. -Door to the deck didn't actually latch shut, but at least it had a lock chain like on front doors. -Room keys both stopped working...twice...and had to be reset. -Elevators sometimes reopened immediately after shutting for no reason, had to hit door close again. Or were summoned to the floor I was waiting on, then didn't open. Had to 'summon' the elevator again for the door to open."

The room was spacious and quiet. Everyone and I mean everyone was helpful and friendly. The rooftop bar called The Monkey Board was so terrific. Saturday night was a fun dance party and Sunday afternoon we enjoyed the sun and had some of the most delicious crawfish i have ever had. Thank you so much for this fantastic review of your stay and please know that it has been shared among our team. Chef Dana will be thrilled to know how much you enjoyed his crawfish and its always nice to hear when the team exceeds all expectations of our guests.We appreciate you staying with us and look forward to always being your hotel of choice in New Orleans.Best regards,"
"5423",3,"Check in - very helpful. Room - probably as we thought from the reviews (we took a chance seeing the comments about refurbishment). Beds - comfortable in main room, pretty shocking bed settee for the kids to sleep on in the sitting area. Pool - looked dirty although we did not use, plenty of others did. Gym - very poor and should be removed as a feature (planet fitness ideal if you do need a day pass for a workout!) Location - absolutely fine for Busch Gardens. Noise - no real problems at all. Price - absolutely fine. Wifi - just about OK. Breakfast - OK. We were not disappointed as such, the hotel was OK, they know they need to refurbish, but probably need to do this sooner rather than later to avoid too many negative reviews. Our main reason for choosing the hotel was because it had separate rooms for us and the kids and it fitted the bill for this reason."
"5424",1,"Absolutely horrible! I was looking for an affordable place to stay for a weekend trip to Watkins Glen and decided to book this place. Worst decision I ever made! I arrived about 10:00pm, had to ring a doorbell to be checked in by a man who came out to the desk in his UNDERWEAR. The room had a musty smell... More"
"5425",2,"Bad: Room smelled, mattress was thin and hard. Clerk changed my rate to higher price when we arrived saying we got wrong rate. Charged more than was quoted on booking. Gave us a map and I guess they get a lot of complaints because it says FYI hotel built on 1989. Bring your own toiletries. Very little lighting in room and no electric plugs. Everything was plugged into an extension cord. Good: Location and parking."
"5426",5,"We were very happy with the quality and cleanliness of the hotel. When shelling out money for a hotel these are important things for me. Yet, I don't want to pay high end prices to get them. This hotel had met these things at the right price."
"5427",5,"Bad: The bar tender in the Casino was not at all friendly or attentive. Good: very nice restored hotel. Excellent condition. Great atmosphere. A very nice place to stay in Downtown Las Vegas"
"5428",5,"I've come to expect an excellent level of comfort at Hilton brand hotels, and this Hampton Inn did not disappoint! Spotlessly clean, with friendly staff, free breakfast and comfortable rooms. This hotel also has a shuttle service to downtown Newport, which is very convenient, since parking is at a premium during the summer season."
"5429",5,"It's for our weekend get away, and it was a pleasant stay at Homewood Suites. Will go back there."
"5430",5,"We spent three days here with friends -- sampling restaurants and sightseeing. This hotel is an easy walk to most market street, the Battery and older sections of town. The staff is pleasant, helpful and courtieous. No complaints."
"5431",5,"Bad: The street noise was pretty bad. Honking horns til all hours. Hard to sleep. Good: Loved the continental breakfast on every floor so you didn't have to go far. The staff was great and it was a great location."
"5432",4,"The hotel is very near the sea...I think about 30 seconds on foot!The rooms are comfortable and clean. No luxury but very good value for money, if we consider the wonderful location of this hotel. Moreover, the staff is extremely kind, friendly and willing to help you...I will never forget the housekeeping manager, who was so sweet, and always gave me breakfast (and in abundant helping) after 10.00 am, since I was always late (let's say I enjoyed Honolulu's nightlife...). All in all, the aloha spirit is so evident in this hotel, which I strongly recommend."
"5433",5,"Pool was awesome. It's only 3 1/2 feet deep at the deep end and 1 foot in the shallow in. Has two slides a basketball hoop, fountains, a thing with ropes and pads across the water that you can try a cross and little water cannons. Also has a hot tub for the parents. Free WiFi. Very clean from what... More"
"5434",4,"I check in the interior of the hotel was clean. When I got to my room, I found someone sock over in the corner and a belt under the bed. Then when I got ready to take a shower the water was cold. The mattress in the bed was not firm, it had a sunk in the middle. Overall the hotel was nice but the mattress in room 416 need to be thrown out. I was uncomfortable the entire night."
"5435",4,"We had a nice time. Pool could have been a little warmer but my granddaughter love it. The breakfast was wonderful and very tasty the lady working that morning was so fun to talk to,,,she made you feel like you were at a restaurant she did her job very well. The front desk people were friendly and the hot cookies were delicious...."
"5436",3,"We stayed here one night due to travel for an Eagles game. For the money,not a bad deal."
"5437",3,"The location is convenient for my friends since they speak limited English, there are lots of Chinese restaurants and stores within walking distance. The hotel service was terrible, we waited at lobby for almost two hours before they can check us in because they were having trouble finding available rooms, we made the reservations weeks ago and I expect the rooms are ready when we arrive."
"5438",4,"Bad: I didn't like that someone got stabbed in front of the W hotel on Saturday night. Made me feel really safe! Apparently that's happened before. Good: The atmosphere and cleanliness were great."
"5439",4,"Convenient location on edge of Napa...rooms appeared to be recently renovated and were well appointed. Staff was extremely pleasant. Rates were competitive...free breakfast next door for BW Gold Crowne members.Rainier66 - Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We are pleased you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you again in the future."
"5440",4,"I stayed at the Virginian Suites for one night in February and I was overall impressed with the hotel. It's a little difficult to get to if you don't know the area, but it's very convenient to restaurants and Georgetown, it would probably be a nice walk in the spring/summer. I stayed in a studio suite and there was a full kitchen with dishes and cooking utensils and it was very clean. There was a flat screen tv and couch. (A bit uncomfortable though). The bed was comfortable with high quality sheets. The bathroom was clean, but a bit small. There is a lot of storage and a large closet, so it would be a good place to stay for an extended period of time. The staff was very attentive, and the Washington Post was delivered in the morning. The only complaints I have are that the internet password did not work (though I'm sure this could have been fixed had I bothered to call the front desk), the small bathroom, and the fact that you have to pay for parking (7 a night). Other than that, I definitey recommend this hotel!"
"5441",4,"This Holiday Inn Express was in the perfect location for our needs on a recent Montana trip. The staff were very friendly and took care of our needs. The breakfast in the moring is your standard Holiday Inn Express breakfast that always gives you a good start to the day. The rooms were very clean and tidy. I would not... More"
"5442",5,"Bad: Everything was great. Good: Superior experience. Loved everything about this hotel. Very comfortable, well thought out and fun arrangement of the room, great shower and products, good restaurants, wonderful roof bar. Looking forward to the next visit!"
"5443",5,"Staff very friendly and helpful. Room was great! Can't wait to come back!"
"5444",1,"I was lead to believe through your site that pets were welcome and no extra fee was charged, then when I got there they told me I had to pay x-amount a day but since the only person staying the next night was my grandmother and I would be leaving with my cat that was all I would be charged but then I was charged 2x more and they said there was nothing they could do about this. I even confronted the same person and asked why I was paying 2x more and that this was not what you told me the day before, he said he was sorry, but I was to pay 2x more. I will never go to Days Inn again, x amount a day is ridiculous."
"5445",4,"We had a 4th floor room for 3 nights. The noise level was fantastic--we never heard much street traffic or other people in the hotel. The rooms are also super-nice. We were a little skeptical when we saw the outside of the hotel, but don't judge this book by its cover. We booked well in advance and had a pretty... More"
"5446",4,"Came in late and stayed one night for a concert at RedRocks. Close to the venue. Good view out the window of the foothills. Plenty of food options in the immediate vicinity."
"5447",4,"These little villas are surprisingly clean for the price. I liked that there was no carpet in our villa (Room 113- queen bed) because there's nothing worse than stepping on old, icky motel carpets. The floor was wood laminate that looked newly installed. The bathroom was fine except it did have a shower stall, so the space was a bit... More"
"5448",4,"Decent for the price, my room didn't have a microwave. I inquired about that at checkout, and was told to make sure to ask when I make my reservation. This stay I was on the end of the building away from the railroad tracks, thus giving more restful sleep. Overall good stay."
"5449",5,"This is a great place to stay, particularly for the value. It would be nice if they offered a breakfast bar."
"5450",1,"I was expecting the type of property from years past, where the quaint experience of Baleens and the exotic decor reigned. Needless to say, it doesn't even resemble what was. The first experience was with a property manager that appeared to come from a different industry, as he was extremely rude and overwhelming. The fancy elegance with the monkey- theme... More"

Staff... More"
"5453",3,"Will not stay again as they place pet friendly rooms along freeway section that has no sound wall barrier. Then give earplugs within the room with a complimentary note. A five cent earplug, and you drop 170 a night to listen to a roaring freeway."
"5454",4,"Bad: Not so close to where I wanted to be, but that was my fault. Good: Loved the layout of the room. Spacious and comfy."
"5455",3,"We stayed here for location. Easy access to Asheville and Hendersonville and the NC Arboretum."
"5456",5,"Very highly recommended. Outstanding staff. Great location. Spacious rooms with very comfortable beds. Tastefully and creatively decorated public areas and rooms. Restaurant very good as well. Stands out as a unique and exceptional vacation experience."

In the morning I was delighted with a great smile from Angela who was making sure we had what we needed. Great! breakfast selection, I really enjoyed the pancake machine.. Great Coffee too! Thank you and keep up the great job you are... More"
"5459",5,"Bad: The only negative was some mysterious in-room snack bar charges that appeared on my bill after I left. I contacted the hotel, and they promptly removed them. This has happened to me at other Starwood properties before, and I'm not sure why. Good: The hotel is in a great location and is clean/modern with a courteous staff. The room I was in was spacious and quiet, and had everything I needed."
"5460",3,"very noisy at night, from people walking around and talking in the hallway. not recommend."
"5461",5,"We had a great experience at this hotel. The staff was wonderful from beginning to end. The hotel was decorated beautifully. I had to take pictures and bring them home to show my mom and friends. I LOVED the decor!! The staff was quick to check us in. They were so friendly and nice. We have stayed at a lot... More"
"5462",5,"Good: Beautiful rooms and amenities - L'occitane products. The restaurant Finch great food and amazing bar. Loved the Boxer"
"5463",4,"The hotel is nice and we have a great room. Lobby is very inviting. The people at this hotel are very friendly especially Bethlehem at the Starwood club. What I have really notice is a lack of personnel. I think there are not enough employees for the size of the establishment. There has never been anyone outside for valet parking,... More"
"5464",4,"Angenehmer Hotelaufenthalt mit ausreichendem Fruhstucksangebot. Hotel wurde uberwiegend nur zur Ubernachtung genutzt. Positiv das Zimmer war sauber und komfortabel eingerichtet. Negativ, man konnte das Fenster nicht offnen wodurch das Luften des Zimmers nur durch die Klimaluftung erfolgte. Ansonsten freundliches Service-Personal. Der Shuttleservice funktionierte ohne Probleme."
"5465",3,"There were no towels or blankets in our room. When I called the front desk, they made me come down to pick up the towels. They said that they were out of blankets. Really How does a hotel run out of blankets I guess someone was on vacation when the need to order more blankets was supposed to be placed."
"5466",5,"Every staff member very accommodating, welcoming and friendly!"
"5467",5,"Stayed there just for a weekend trip for a wedding and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was for the price! The breakfast in the morning was good for a hotel and for being included with plenty of options to choose from. The rooms were very clean, the beds comfortable. All in all, I would definitely stay here... More"

Very eco-friendly, super-pleasant staff and clean, attractive accommodations. Pool area was great, there is a cantina restaurant very popular right on the property... More"
"5470",5,"Pleasantly surprised. Decently priced, clean, and super friendly staff. The discovery of a pool right outside of our widow the next morning, was an added benefit. We would definitely stay here again. The only drawback would be the weak Wi-Fi. I mentioned it to the front desk on check out and they seemed surprised even though many comments state the same thing."
"5471",5,"Great urban hotel by the riverfront in Portland, with excellent city walking into downtown area of Portland -- lots of great surrounding restaurants in the nearby areas. Happy hour wine and appetizers at Hotel Rose are a bargain. Try the bacon wrapped date with chorizo stuffing. Staff was friendly and super helpful."
"5472",5,"The hosts were friendly and welcoming. They were available to answer any of my concerns or needs."
"5473",5,"Quiet and peaceful surrounding neighborhood during off season, friendly staff, clean spacious rooms and balcony with view of the beach."
"5474",3,"This is a pretty dated, budget roadside motel in Ironwood but it is clean, convenient, and the hosts are gracious and fun to talk to. We got one of the last rooms available and it was above the lobby. It had tiny narrow aisles with four - count them, FOUR - beds (two regular, one bunk) that they said were... More"
"5475",5,"The hotel lobby is quaint, but the room was well appointed. The room slept well and the internet connections was great. The property is in a great locations, closely located near the slopes and the amphitheater. There was a welcome reception that was very nice, with complimentary wine and hors d'oeuvres. This was a lovely trip, I hope to visit... More"
"5476",2,"Bad: When we arrived we were met by a unfriendly doorman and it was so loud due to the bar that we could barely hear the person at reception. Each day the room was made up apparently but barely even folded the sheets. towels weren't folded etc. We have stayed in lots of hotels over the years and had recently stayed at the Loews Boston which was a far far better experience with far friendlier staff. Good: Food was awesome."
"5477",5,"The staff were outstanding! So professional courteous! I will definitely stay here again!"
"5478",5,"Between the front desk (too many greats to name) to Hussain and Israel (tenth floor butlers), to the great staff at King Cole's, this is an excellent property. I have stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz, and elsewhere, and found this to be a great place. Highly appreciated. Room was great, but as is clear from the hotel business, property is secondary to service.Service rules, and the St Regis staff is excellent. Kudos to Krista the concierge (not to miss the stars). I recommend this hotel. Expensive, yes, but value received.Dear rowingman,Thank you so much for sharing your kind words about our staff. Our team makes it our mission to provide genuine service to each and every guest and we are so pleased that you experienced this firsthand. We will share your feedback with Hassan, Israel, Krista, and the team! We hope to see you again soon at The St. Regis New York.Kindly,Hermann W. ElgerGeneral Manager"

"5482",3,"The hotel was perfect for a place to lay your head. Conveniently located."
"5483",3,"This hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and beds were comfortable. The ONLY warning I will give is to those couples looking for a romantic getaway in Napa. One of the selling points (in my opinion) on their site was the comfortable outdoor seating area with a beautiful fireplace. If there are private parties booked that area won't be available to you until 10 p.m. We were disappointed and unaware of this as our hotel had private parties every night we were there."
"5484",5,"We stayed at this Best Western in mid-March and were pleasantly surprised at how nice it was for not being a high-end hotel. It is on a busy route and is not in a scenic spot, but it is handy to the highway to area attractions. Most importantly, it was neat and clean and looked like the decor had recently... More"

"5489",4,"The hotel was a bit smaller than we thought it would be, but it was perfect for the weekend. Very clean and nicely furnished. Not a bad walk to historic downtown."
"5490",4,"I had a great stay. It was easy access to the interstate, as well as easy access into downtown DC. I must say I was disappointed with having to pay for parking. Overall breakfast was good, but on two different days I had to contact the concierge about sour dairy products. The problem was fixed, but it made me leary. Well rested nights. This is good deal."
"5491",4,"Clean, comfortable and complimentary breakfast. Staff was very good and no surprises. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
"5492",5,"Good: Clean and nice room with comfortable bed. Really friendly staff. This hotel is my favourite in Miami Beach."
"5493",4,"Bad: Waitress didn't come around a lot even with tipping. The hotel was older and had some cosmetic problems. Good: Lots to around the property and decent food prices. The buffet was really good."
"5494",4,"Older hotel that is in the middle of a commercial business park, stayed for a few days, room was clean and well furnished, walls are a little thin, but that's what you get with an older place. good coffee shop in the lobby, walking distance to Karl Strauss Brew Pub, would stay again."
"5495",4,"I had a really nice time at the hotel with my parents. The room was nice the view was nice as well . The best part of my stay was the restaurant inside the hotel I had a very nice and polite waitress named Wilj. All In all I had fun with my family. I thank you for the lovely... More"
"5496",4,"Like that they let us have a late check out and and very good breakfast"
"5497",4,"Bad: The Wi-Fi works with a portal login, I had to log-in like 5 times each day for every device I was using, even if I hadn't left the room. Super annoying and I'd say enough reason for any business traveller to avoid an otherwise super nice hotel. Good: The hotel is super stylish, the room was perfect. The hotel feels new clean throughout. Nice atmosphere in the bar area."
"5498",4,"Bad: Floors need to be vacuumed much better. Finding old snack food and candy is not what I would expect. It wasn't horrible, but noticeable. On 2 separate occasions we had hotel staff come into our room. First time was shortly after we arrived. Housekeeping was confused on which room she was to clean. No big deal. 2nd time was on Monday morning, about 9:30-10AM, someone opened our door without knocking, noticed we were in there and left. By the time I could get up and get to the door, look out, they were gone. This was VERY odd and concerning. Good: Location was fantastic. Front desk staff were outstanding."
"5499",5,"Great new hotel with amazing access to shopping and some nightlife - not to mention day time beach trips! If you get a higher floor you can see the entire boardwalk and down the coast in both directions. Pretty funny to watch the great HB police case off the night time beach goers!"
"5500",5,"Very affordable for clean rooms, good service and locations. Manager helpful with questions about what to do in the area. Rented a daily for just 35 - great price for a family of 4. Their website, nealscourt.com, has information and pictures."

I do NOT recommend this hotel to anyone, on check in they explained to us we need to leave a holding fee of which will be refunded on check out if we were not to use anything (of which we didn't). I left this holding fee then only on check... More"
"5502",3,"The hotel itself wasn't bad. The location worked for my purpose and the lobby was clean, staff friendly, etc. my room was a bit on the gross side. The couch had stains on it, the rug by the bathroom looked like someone missed and in the morning the toilet backed up, confirming my impression of the rug stains. I couldn't wait to get to the next stop so I could feel clean again!"
"5503",4,"Stayed two nights over parents weekend in October. The bleak exterior and entrance was a little off-putting, so we were pleasantly surprised by the size and condition of the room. The heat wasn't working, so it was pretty cold, but it was obvious they were doing their best to fix it so we toughed it out the first night. They supplied a space heater the next morning, but then moved us to another room (just as clean and comfortable) the second night. The hotel was full but we never heard our neighbors. Bathroom and breakfast were basic. Staff was friendly. Odd-numbered rooms face rear/away from street and parking lot. Recommended for quick stay."
"5504",5,"Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast is outstanding! This is where our family always stays whenever we are in the Washington, D. C. area."
"5505",4,"A beautiful, historic hotel in a perfect location with a fantastic staff (and great bar). The only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star review is the forced air heating system in our room, the vent for which was located over the bed and kicked on every so often, waking us up with an initial blast of cool breeze before it warmed up..."

"5509",5,"Jack Huff's has delivered again. We've found this to be one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at. The rooms are bigger than the major chains, friendly staff and clean. It's a little old school with reservations and room keys but we'll worth it."

"5511",5,"Clean and great customer service! Excellent place to stay."
"5512",2,"The location is nice as well as the hotel staff, but is not a good place to stay if you need to get any sleep at night. I stayed there twice and both times I had to call down to the front desk and have security come up and investigate noise issues. Guests seemed to congregate in the hallways creating lots of noise into the wee hours of the mornings."
"5513",3,"The room was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our only complaints were that the tv had terrible reception and had lines through the screen. Also there was definitely people smoking pot on our floor as we could smell it everyday. The only other things were obviously unavoidable, like the construction right next door that was very loud, and the power going out one morning."
"5514",5,"The sea captain has it all, it is the friendliest place I have ever had the good fortune to visit. My self and my family will be returning for the third year in a row this September. The staff are exceptional and cannot be any more welcoming than they are. You truly feel like part of a family. Along with... More"
"5515",4,"The rooms and service are good but my rate went up over what my company wants to pay. I will have to find a lower rate in Henderson or I will have to stay in Owensboro where I have a lower rate."
"5516",5,"The motel is well located on the Wind River with easy access and parking. The room was very clean, well kept and the beds were very comfortable. New TV, refrig and coffee maker and easy internet access. The breakfast was very good and the folks that run the motel were very pleasant and helpful. We had a very pleasant stay."
"5517",5,"I love this Best Western Plus hotel, because I know I will have a pleasant stay. To begin with, the hotel bed and pillows were inviting, allowing me to have a good nights sleep. After my peaceful sleep I enjoyed a nice breakfast from the on-site restaurant. Checking out was a breeze, allowing me to get to destination quickly. I... More"
"5518",2,"Bad: Bed bugs. Room too small. Too expensive When I was going to sleep, I found some bed bugs in my bed. It's terrible! I went to lobby to find someone help me. The receptionist helped me change a room. This room is even smaller than the previous one. I can't sleep all the night because it's too noisy, and I am still afraid of the bugs. The next day, I told the receptionist I would like to check out, even I booked for 3 night. She agreed, but didn't give me any compensation. I paid 300+ for a room which had bugs and was noisy, small. Good: The attitude of staff."
"5519",1,"The hotel clerk checked someone else into our room and we were awoken in terror at 1 am by someone attemping to enter our room (their key opened the door but we had the slide lock closed). Never had a problem with Microtel in the past, but this was so far beyond unacceptable that we'll never stay at one again."
"5520",5,"L'hotel e a 20 minuti da Washington ma si raggiunge facilmente grazie ad una superstrada e il prezzo e molto conveniente rispetto alle grandi catene presenti in citta."
"5521",1,"The walls had unpainted spackle. There was a loose bulb hanging from bare wires in the bathroom. I told the front desk the bulb was a safety hazard and should be replaced but they didn't bother to fix it. I got the impression that they don't care about the condition of their own hotel."
"5522",1,"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave.

"5523",5,"Hotel was a good choice, about 10 mins from the actual beach but me and my family were satisfied. It would have been 100 perfect if there was an indoor pool, but it wasn't. Great hotel though!"
"5524",4,"My Dad and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Atlanta for the Chick Fil-A kickoff game between Louisville and Auburn. It was good value for money, with a spacious and comfortable room that was in great shape. The bathroom was spotless and seemed new. Even on the fifth floor, the noise from breakfast diners begins at 7:00 AM... More"
"5525",4,"On a visit to San Francisco my husband and I decided to take a quick over night with friends to Napa and ended up at Inn at the Vines. The hotel is a little older but in pretty good shape. Our room was large and clean enough! The location for us was good. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning.The poor girl checking us in was alone and pretty darn busy. She was great though!! We would certainly recommend the hotel for anyone staying a night or 2 in Napa!!Thank you for your review and compliments on our hotel.Come back and see us again."
"5526",4,"Bad: Young girl on front desk was very abrupt. Good: For us the location was great,a nice 10 min walk to the strip. Nice clean rooms. Nice pool and hot tub."
"5527",5,"Great location for a Fourth of July weekend! Wonderful staff, comfortable room woulddefinitely stay here again!"
"5528",5,"We decided to try Viceroy Santa Monica after staying at Viceroy Abu Dhabi and enjoying it so much. The hotel is set a street or two back from the beach which was fine but we had an ocean view room which made up for it. There may be some traffic noise if you're staying on the lower floors but we...

"5529",4,"Wonderful place to stay. Just a short walk to everything. Very clean but remember to take the do not disturb sign off your door before 11:00 am or there is no room service. We took it off at 11:15 am and the cleaning cart was at our door when we left the room. We returned at 4:30 pm and the... More"
"5530",5,"The Broome is a well-situated, warm and welcoming boutique hotel in the heart of Soho. The rooms are sizable and airy, the staff friendly and knowledgeable and the location superb. My daughter and I had a wonderful time and will definitely return.Dear Bethshorstein:Thank you again for choosing to stay with us at The Broome SoHo NYC and thank you for taking the time to share with us.

Until then, if you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to contact us at infothebroomenyc.com."
"5531",4,"After arriving at the train stop having taken the train from the Baltimore airport, I called the hotel for the shuttle to pick me up. There was no signage for where the pickup was to meet the shuttle. Unfortunately, I didn't listen carefully to the description of where the pick up would be, so I assumed it was on the opposite side of the train tracks, and I missed it. Moral of the story: don't assume you know where the shuttle bus will pick you up. After that, The shuttle worked very well. In the room, the bathroom smelled funky and the air conditioning unit was noisy. The breakfast was very good, and the staff was friendly."
"5532",3,"Nice hotel with clean rooms but a very odd location off the Interstate. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was not protected from the abundance of highway noise throughout the night. Additionally, it's not extremely intuitive on how to actually get to the hotel through a very weird access road. And, we thought the parking was limited especially... More"
"5533",5,"Bad: That I couldn't stay longer because of work. Good: All the lights and the view"
"5534",4,"Great Rates. Convenient Location with plenty of restaurants. Safe Neighborhood. Clean and Comfortable Rooms. Very Friendly Staff. That about does it for a guy like me looking for a low frills travel bargain. Sure you could do better for bigger coin, but you could definitely do a whole lot worse. I've stayed there twice, and just like Arnold, I'll be back."
"5535",5,"I am traveling across the country, to California, with my daughter from Omaha NE and was completely exhausted by the time I had reached the Ramada Inn. I was cranky, sore and wanted nothing more than to soak in the tub and go to sleep. The was a problem with the tub which only agitated an already foul mood. Kerry... More"
"5536",5,"Bad: Pool crowded with local moms tots. Would love common gathering room, all designated common space is also used for meetings and were booked while we were there. Good: Charming, quiet, clean- friendly staff! Fun happy hours at tiny corner bars. Beautiful courtyard garden. Large fire pit out front."
"5537",4,"Good: Love the location on the Chicago River. I liked the hotel before the Remodel. Dispointed no Christmas tree in the lobby. Bedding as always super comfy (I like Westin hotels). . I've stayed here many times and if the price is right will continue, however if your looking to walk into a hotel and get wow factor, this one is not for you."
"5538",2,"Not the best place we have stayed at in Atlantic City but it was the worse. Rooms had a moldy smell. The first night we stayed there a fight broke out in the hallway. The second night another fight broke out. Now I understand the hotel can't control that but to a certain extent I feel like the annex just... More"
"5539",5,"This is my first review on TA which should tell you we were very happy with our experience. Value for money in the heart of prime time vacation season was excellent. Every single person was extremely friendly. Not a fancy place however that is not what they are shooting for. They are a very nice vacation motel with good sized... More"
"5540",3,"Bad: Noise!!! in the room you can hear the noise from the corridor and from neighboring rooms."
"5541",1,"Furniture and fixtures were in desperate need of repair and updates. Desk was wobbly. Furniture was scratched. AC unit looked like it was going to die. Toilet seat was worn and needed to be replaced, etc."
"5542",4,"Overall I had a great stay at this hotel. I was traveling alone with three children four years old and younger and needed a place to overnight that was safe, affordable and comfortable. The room was a great size, the beds and pillows were very comfortable and the linens were good quality. We arrived after midnight and the hostess that greeted us was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast spread was nice and the pool area looked amazing though sadly we had no time to enjoy it. Only negative I had with this stay is that I requested a crib for the night and it was not set up when we got into the room. Unfortunately we checked in so late that although there was a crib available for the front desk to provide one, were no linens for it. Since I had a portable one in my car this wasn't a big deal for me (other than an extra trip out to the parking lot)."
"5543",4,"Bad: Th e food wasnt that good. Good: The breakfast buffett was good, the other 2 restaurants were just fair, in fact in one of them I got sick with the food."
"5544",5,"Stayed one night and it was perfect for our travel plans. The hotel is quiet, clean and up to date. The staff was friendly and efficient. Loved the bright color scheme and all the big fluffy towels in the bath. The water pressure was out of this world. The lighting a bit dim in the bathroom but overall a perfect... More"

Breakfast, which came with the room, was also good. Omelet station, waffles, and an assortment of other breakfast items including fruit, yogurt, cereals, breads, and sausage or... More"
"5549",5,"We had an absolutely delightful stay at the charming 1906 Lodge. It's hard to know where to begin describing all the positive aspects of staying there! Our room, The Plunge, was spacious and clean. Breakfast in the morning was a culinary treat. A cold buffet and hot entre were both available. We made use of the cruiser bikes and loved... More"
"5550",3,"Location was great for sightseeing. Neighborhood very poor where hotel located. Rooms were comfortable and clean....only issue bathroom was small. Exercise room needs some updating though. Breakfast was adequate."
"5551",5,"From the front desk to the room and next day breakfast this place is first class. It is crowded due to being the homebase of Cox Cable employees - so book ahead! Just off 680 on the west side - you can get to anywhere in Omaha from here quick."
"5552",1,"Pigsty. Room wasn't cleaned they claimed to only have smoking rooms available. Rowdy drunks till 3am."
"5553",5,"We were driving through for one night at Blue Sands Motel. Greeted so kindly, we chose them for price we were surprised at how nice for the money. I love to be able to walk to the beach and it fit the bill. I like quiet, check. I like a room that smells clean, check. Great bike paths for riding... More"
"5554",5,"Stayed here for one night while in town to see a show. As noted, the staff was very friendly. Even though I wouldn't call it a wine tasting, the little happy hour they provide is unique and a cute amenity. Our room was small, but that was expected. Plus, it was clean. More than anything, free Wi-Fi is always a... More"
"5555",5,"Best place to stay in Seattle. All the staff are really friendly and helpful. Rooms are spotless. Beds to die for....Seriously didn't want to get up. Many restaurants, bars, and things to to within walking distance. Delicious Cupcakes every afternoon. When we need a place to stay in Seattle we will always stay here. Wished we could have stayed longer.... More"
"5556",3,"nice quiet comfortable room"
"5557",3,"Very Nice Hotel. Great location for CCL guest to stay. Stay away from building number 4.Thanks for the great comments and glad you liked it. Building four can get loud as it is next to the pool area though many guests love it just for that reason. Hope to see you soon!"
"5558",2,"I was extremely disappointed in the customer service I received from the wait staff for breakfast, it was the managers wife which is even worse, she was very rude and nasty, it was the way that she told us that we had to have shoes on our feet to be in the breakfast area which it was not posted anywhere,... More"
"5559",5,"Staff accommodated our room request upon arrival. Rooms were extremely clean organized. Kitchenette is a nice touch. Nice pool for the kids, no spa. Breakfast food selection was average, limited space. Great place to stay at a great value!"
"5560",5,"The Dickinson Hampton Inn Suites is the best Hampton hotel I have stayed in. I have been a Hilton Honors Gold and Diamond member since 2007, and this is the best stay I have ever had with the Hilton properties. This hotel deserves your business if you are traveling to Dickinson ND."
"5561",5,"Our flight was cancelled due to the Southwest computer debacle of July 2016 so we needed to find rooms with very little notice. Fortunately the Hampton Inn Suites Denver/Airport-Gateway Park had space for us. After I returned our rental car Hampton sent a very luxurious shuttle bus to pick me up at the airport. The hotel was within convenient... More"
"5562",2,"this is not a 3 star hotel - on top of cleanliness issues, we had a two issues with wake up calls. One 2 hours early and the other which didn't come at all."
"5563",5,"I had an amazing time. The hotel is close to all the tourist spots. The hotel has free shuttle service to and from the hotel and to the metro station. The bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to get out of bed. The free breakfast was amazing!"
"5564",4,"The room was nice, locations was great, very comfortable. Only thing was there were small roaches in restroom and tub."
"5565",5,"Great location close to the stadium but far enough away from the craziness. Nice staff and well maintained hotel. Love the free evening drinks and breakfast in the morning."
"5566",5,"We were looking for a nice hotel to stay for a couple of days and we wanted to take our dog for her first trip.. This was more than we expected! Personal so nice and attentive, the place is so beautiful and dog treats!! We love this place!"
"5567",5,"Bad: No one knew where the sauna was located. Good: Bed was amazing, bathroom was amazing, great view"
"5568",4,"I stayed at the Ocean Tower Hotel for a week in early May based on positive reviews from TripAdvisor. These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)"
"5569",5,"At this hotel I found a Friendly staff, spacious clean rooms, and a delicious hot breakfast (included with stay) The hotel had an indoor pool and hot tub, and an onsite fitness center, but also offered a day pass to work out at the Golds gym not far away.

"5572",5,"Excellent location on the fringes of an up-scale shopping area and lots of restaurants within walking distance, just off Rt 29/250 By Pass. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with couch and chairs for lounging. The eating area provides a well appointed free breakfast and was perfect for gathering off-hours for a drink from the bar/Starbucks. The staff was bright and... More"

"5574",4,"I've stayed at this hotel numerous times over the last year. I travel mainly for business to the Harrisburg area a lot. Recently, I took a hiatus from the Courtyard, and tried some other area hotels (Marriotts and Hiltons).

"5581",5,"Perfect stay. I really enjoyed my time here. It is close to the grey hound bus stop. It is quiet. For the price, it is an amazing place. 40.00 is great considering it's close to downtown and ybor city. Thete is grocery and convenience stores and laundry all within walking distance. I was even able to find some green."
"5582",5,"I spend a lot of my life in hotels and I can say I hardly ever review them. The service at this location, is so great though it is hard to not say anything.

"5594",5,"We were within walking distance to the town, shops, and restaurants. The bed had the same beautiful linens as Congress Hall. The trolley ride through the decorated town was fun."
"5595",4,"Bad: The restaurant was closed for the day when we arrived so we had to go out yo eat and the free happy hour that I'd read about had been discontinued. That was particularly disappointing as that was one of the factors I looked at when choosing a hotel. Also, the view we had was the parking lot, not the city view I expected. Good: The bed was very comfortable, what I'd expect from a Westin."
"5596",5,"The rooms was excellent the breakfast was great with a very good price."

"5602",5,"I was with four other people on a birding trip to watch the hawk migration. We spotted over 50 species of birds as we traveled across the keys. The hotel is new. The room was spacious and I loved the shower, microwave, and mini frig. The breakfast was wonderful and allowed us to make an early start for our birding. I commend Rosemary Johnson, an employee, that assisted me in finding ice, entering the pool area, and making me feel welcome even though it was late at night. Thank you for a lovely experience.Thank you for your comments. So glad you had a great stay. Rosemary is one of many of our amazing team members here to assist our guests.

"5605",5,"Last second decision to visit Baltimore. We were greeted by Marq, a pleasant young man, who upgraded us to a king suite. She even provided us discounted tickets to the aquarium when we checked out the following day. The room was very spacious, clean and quiet. (Our room was close to the elevators but we didn't eben noticed it). The location of the hotel is central to the inner harbor offerings and to Little/Italy and Fells landing. There are many upscale stores nearby to browse as well as many fine restaurants. The gym was fine to work a quick sweat. Breakfast included was decent but nothing to rave about. Overall, the staff was very courteous and the hotel had a modern edge look which suited us just fine. Marq was the superstar during our stay. HIgh recommendation."

"5648",3,"The only good feature about the room was the price. Although clean for the most part it was listed as non-smoking but it was clear the room had been smoked in. Maintenance was very poor. The toilet tank cover was missing and the seat would not stay up. The coffee service in the room had not bee replaced in ages. There was a small balcony outside the room but there were holes in the ceiling covering it. Also, the building was not secured at night. Anyone could walk in. The building is old and really needs to be renovated."

Chairs and umbrellas on the beach from an external provider from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm included. Towels are provided. Valet parking 35 for 24h, no overnight street parking (day 4/h)."
"5652",4,"20 Extra charge for King bed, 10 charge for a microwave in the room, but couldn't put it in because maintenance wasn't on site. The room was decent and clean. The staff was friendly enough. Another guest with body odor permeated the lobby with her essence and it was quickly addressed. Location is very convenient and the price was reasonable. We missed breakfast, so I cannot provide feedback on that."

The free breakfast has many options such as waffles, eggs, sausage etc. The hotel is centrally located near area restaurants and the local shopping mall. A great place to stay in the Elmira Horseheads area."

"5666",4,"Hotel was in reasonable conditio. We were upgraded to a junior suite. The room was nice, reasonable clean and confortable and located near a Metro Station. The neighborhood was questionable, though we had no problems, I wouldn't recommend going out at night. Breakfast was limited, but plenty of food."
"5667",3,"Hotel is clean, staff is friendly. Breakfast may be a hit or miss, guess depends on who is preparing the food.

"5669",4,"First off I'll start with The Saint is an unique boutique hotel that sits on Eaton Street with access to Duval Street. We had booked what they call the petite double I believe and they aren't wrong. My husband paced it out and we figured it was approx 150 square feet. That being said it did have everything you needed and was tastefully done, but you'd never want to stay in it more then a night or two. They had a lovely balcony over looking Duval Street that sadly for us was 1 room away from ours and on NY's Eve they had their party on it . I wish I would have known this in advance as laying in bed after midnight it felt and sounded as if I was still in the middle of the dance floor. That aside I suppose I should have expected that being NY's but I've never been in a hotel especially a Marriott where the party was more important to the guest comfort. They have a lovely bar in the lobby away from the guest rooms which would have been a better and less noisy option for the quests who weren't attending their NYs party. All and all I'd say there are plenty of other choices to stay at in Key West at comparable costs (this wasn't cheap at 448.00 per night for 2 for the smallest room) that would cater more to the comfort of their guests then the 50 dollars a person they made at the NY's party.I apologize for the noise on New Year's Eve. Key West is a hot spot for the holiday and our hotel is known for the balcony countdown party overlooking Duval Street. The rates are comparable to other hotels for that night yet may have not been quieter on this busy day on the island. We hope you will give us another visit on a non-holiday and reserve one of our larger Superior King rooms that will be more comfortable for you. Happy New Year to you and your family."

"5678",5,"Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast lady Sunday morning was more interested in talking to people then keeping bar filled and clean. She should be able to do both. I had a knee cart and she would see me trying to get around chairs and tables and just continued to talk to someone and did not help. I had surgery on my foot and needed a place with no stairs for few days. The room was comfortable, spacious and clean. I enjoyed the front porch to sit. Out during the day to get fresh air. Overall the stay was great. Would do it again just to get away for a couple days."
"5679",4,"Place was decent. The AC wasn't the best, but other than that the stay was comfortable."

The hotel location, amenity and resturant ... was great but the bed was kind of old loking and soon soft the if i was staying more than 5 ays that we stay we could heve backach!!!"
"5687",5,"Really enjoyed the stay. Great breakfast to get the day started, then out for the day, came back after dinner, then went in the pool and hot tub to relax and wrap up the day."
"5688",5,"My first visit in 2016 and the Westin's staff continues to provide excellent service. They are genuinely willing to accommodate a guest's request. I enjoy my visits to Greenville but along with a wonderful downtown, great restaurants, beautiful Reedy river it's made complete by returning to the Pointsett to relax and enjoy the down time."
"5689",3,"This hotel is ok if you need a short stay, mostly for sleeping. I stayed two nights, using the swimming pool once. Cons: The breakfast buffet was of mediocre quality (worst is the pastry, tasteless and more like stale bread) The lobby was hot and humid, and could have been cleaner and neater The path to the swimming pool was horrible, filthy, flooded The pool itself is ok, warm, its floor littered with stuff - there is no change room or shower in the pool area Pros WiFi was of good quality, fast and no issue with login or usage Staff were friendly, helpful The bedroom and the bathroom were clean and neat The fridge and all lighting worked well"
"5690",5,"My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!"

"5692",4,"We stayed at the Holiday Inn on a weekend shopping trip to NYC. Our flight arrived at 8am and was traveling with my 3 month old baby. They let us check in early which was nice. It was very easy to go to NYC #320 bus just outside the hotel with a 20 min bus ride to Port Authority. Wifi could not access from our room had to go to lobby to get internet. Other then that it was good. Lots of dining options just outside the hotel. Walmart 5 min away. Would stay there again."

"5718",5,"In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel.

"5726",5,"The hotel is almost completely renovated. All rooms have bay view and no smoking. Room was comfortable with separate seating area and table/chairs. Like the idea of going green by requesting that visitors opt not to have sheets/towels changed everday. Will definitely return."
"5727",4,"After reading terrible reviews, dated a year ago, I was pleasantly surprised that renovations at this motel were complete. My room and bath were clean and new. The bedding was clean and pleasant smelling. The airconditioning was life saving. Check in and check out were as easy as ABC. The cost for a solo guest was well worth the charge. The complimentary breakfast was eye opening. I would not hesitate to stay here again since Waynetown, Indiana does not have a motel."
"5728",5,"Colazione abbondante e con molta scelta. Camere pulite."
"5729",5,"Excellent staff, clean room, easy to check in and out. Great value. The room had wifi which worked well and a great refrigerator. The bed was comfortable and we were able to control the temperature to our liking. We had plenty of towels and washcloths, and they were nice and white and smelled clean."
"5730",2,"With the exception of the shower, this is a reasonably nice hotel in a nice part of town. However, the water saver on the shower was to an extreme... it was barely more than a trickle. Showering took much longer. Even just thoroughly wetting my hair took a while. In the end, it took what seemed at least twice as... More"
"5731",5,"My family had an amazing experience. We arrived early and staff had a room ready for us. The walk to the tram is very short.. breakfast was good but would preffered scramble eggs and potatoes. The only problem was the parking, but staff made it easy to find one for us. Thanks for all the help!!!"
"5732",5,"Great motel, especially if you want to be close to downtown and the MAX. Clean rooms, really helpful staff who know Portland, and excellent location."
"5733",2,"Our room is 24 (second to the last away from the highway). We had booked 17, but we are told that the occupants are extending. The rooms are different prices and differently equipped. No real detail is offered, as there is no consistency room to room. There is a porch allowing the front of the rooms. The railing is falling... More"
"5734",4,"Breakfast staff is second to none, finally someone who is pleasant and truly helpful and a pleasure to be around. He was one of the few I have ever seen that didn't have a grumpy attitude and felt like every thing you did he watched and made you feel bad if you made a mess. superstar!!!"
"5735",5,"My husband and I have been to Charleston multiple times and stayed at a lot of different places in the ""Historic Downtown"". This is out favorite! The staff is amazing! The valet guys actually went to my vehicle to pump up my little girls floaties (I have a tire/air pump to plug into my car). Then they delivered the floaties to the pool!The hotel was also clean and so convenient to everything!"
"5736",4,"Stayed here a couple of weeks ago on a trip south. Needed to get past D.C. This is very good. Just inside VA and easy on and off. Courteous staff, clean.. A real good Hampton. Good restaurants near by. I'm stopping there again next week."

"5738",1,"Good location, nice room, but that's it. No atmosphere, impersonal, not really interested front desk, chaotic and hilarious, above all poor and hardly any choice breakfast, a room with a view of an office building at 20 meter distance (privacy), room cleaned at 17.00 after our request, not a real clean room, found even 2 cockroaches on our bed when we went to sleep, no safe in the room. Just some of our disappointments. Relationship price quality, there is none with usd 689 2 nights! There are no doubt better options in Seattle skipp this one."
"5739",5,"Bad: Nothing, I cherished my stay here. Good: This is a gorgeous little hotel on ocean drive, 200 yards from the busy beach front, just far enough for it to be quiet through the night, the veiw from the rooftop pool was exquisite, the rooms and the restaurant were also of the highest standard. Loved it"
"5740",5,"Thank you Erik for taking care of my friends and I! You made sure everything was taken care of the whole day and even gave us a few places to visit while we're here! The pool was super clean along with the rooms and we have so much fun so far:) we will definitely be returning :) thanks again Erik!"
"5741",1,"I was highly disappointed this time around. This is my second time staying at this hotel and I did not like anything about our room. The 1st time we stayed here the room and price was great so we decided to stay again. We wanted a Jacuzzi and we were told in the room description that we would have one, but instead when we got to the room we had a regular jetted tub that did not work at all. We paid double for a room expecting something spectacular and we got nothing. The breakfast was okay, but it was so congested that you really could not enjoy your meal . Unfortunately, we will not be staying at this hotel again."
"5742",2,"Check in staff were condescending when asking which room we had and made us feel less valued due to booking a budget room. General cleanliness of the room was ok, but a few hairs were found on the towels. The rooms also have very thin walls. The free parking and location to Heavenly was very good along with the proximity... More"

"5748",3,"The looby of the area was very busy. Only one clerk at desk. Took awhile to check-in. However, the room was nice. The bed comfortable. Nice restaurants in walking distance. I would stay there again."
"5749",4,"Hotel looked very nice and modern, rooms are very comfortable and have refrigerators which was great for us to store drinks. Room was very clean and the ammenities were plenty. Only thing is that rooms have LCD's but no HDTV cable, so quality of image was not what it's supposed to be. Check-in/out was very prompt and efficient. Will definitely stay at this hotel again if in DC area."
"5750",5,"Bad: Nothing 1. Good: Very, Very, relaxing!!! All the ammenities were in walking distance of the the hotel."
"5751",4,"Bad: Not the most modern. Could stand upgrading. Good: Close to the beach. Quiet"
"5752",5,"Perfect location to visit FAMU. Local eating places were in walking distance. The mall was literally about 3 minutes away. The feel of being in an almost new facility was wonderful. I would recommend this hotel to those traveling to Tallahassee."
"5753",3,"Decently clean room, but beware if you have allergies. Hotels should offer an alternative to goose down pillows. Hypoallergenic pillows would have been nice instead of having to buy my own. Also, a/c unit in room was quite loud."
"5754",4,"Bad: Nothing..great staff.. Good: Great hotel beds..."
"5755",5,"The Roosevelt staff is very friendly and ready with suggestions for tours and restaurants. The room was spacious and clean.

"5757",5,"We just stayed at the Inn by the Lake for the 4th time and had a great trip. We love the location so we can bike or walk most places. The pool is great and has a two level hot tub! the room is nice and I appreciate having a mini fridge."
"5758",5,"Room was comfortable with a lovely view and well lit with natural light.it is quiet and nearby are some very good restaurants. Great location for family vacation. Will return wherever we visit Boston again"
"5759",5,"Bad: Floor to ceiling see through glass in bathroom. Good: Large floor to ceiling windows overlooking downtown. Chic design."
"5760",3,"Bad: No Lobby, you have to breakfast in your own room. Good: No restaurant, breakfast is misearable, The widows of Aluminium very cold and curtains are noisy"
"5761",5,"Our room was really comfortable and cozy. The hotel is in the middle of the historic downtown, close to the Old Slave Mart Museum, Waterfront Park, St. Michael Church etc. Good restaurant in the hotel or across the street."
"5762",4,"Park right in front of your door! Rooms have flat screen, wifi, micro, fridge. However, no coffeemaker. A little on the high side compared to similar places we've stayed, but still reasonable. No ice machine either."

"5776",5,"I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. It does show its age, but was a very comfortable stay non the less. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool was a hit with the kids and it was great that they had an on duty life guard. Continental breakfast was more than your typical free breakfast with hot food."
"5777",5,"We had 4 rms for family reunion. Our stay was a great experience. All our family needs and requests were met and service exceeded our expectations. The rms were clean and restful. The kids had a balst in the pool and breakfast exceeded our needs. Great job tonthe intire staff in Arizona"
"5778",4,"I booked this hotel for a concert I was taking my teenager to. The room had cracked and nailed badly crown molding. the area close around the bed had not been vacuumed in quite some time. The shower had NO water pressure. On the positive side the beds were comfortable and the pillows were great!"
"5779",5,"From check-in until check-out, this was a fantastic experience. The room was clean, the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff were amazing. I will definitely stay with Home2 Suites by Hilton again!"
"5780",4,"This was our first stay at a Home 2 Suites hotel. The hotel was very modern, clean, and well kept. The entire staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. The breakfast serving area could have been a little bigger to accommodate all of the individuals who were dining at the same time."
"5781",5,"Most friendly employees and always looked happy which is hard to find now days. Clean rooms great breakfast nice pool and had free cookies,tea/coffee/ hot chocolate in the lobby all the time which was pleasing to my kids! Was 3 minutes from six flags!"

"5785",2,"Ask for disabled room on bottom floor. Booked through expedia,never again. Put on 2nd floor, only 1 of the elevators went to 2nd.told by staff to send other elevator to top floor so we could get the correct one to open. Ice machine not on our floor. Rooms were old and smelled musty."
"5786",1,"Mold in the first three rooms they showed me. Not until they sent me to the top floor in the fourth room did I find a room that didn't smell of mold. Good service willing to help, and very attentive, but they need to fix the mold in their rooms."
"5787",3,"We stayed here to attend Kentucky Derby and spent little time in the hotel. The pool was closed for repairs. Friendly staff and conveniently located next to highway. It seems everybody in town smokes, so lots of people hanging around entrance puffing away."
"5788",4,"excellent location near convention center. friendly, willing staff. not a true luxury hotel in terms of the room I received, but a comfortable clean room, I didn't really need any more than that. After all you're here to visit San Francisco, not the hotel."
"5789",5,"We close on our house downtown, and needed a place to stay after the move. I really didn't have that much time at the hotel,because I was in late, and out early. My wife had more time, and really enjoyed it. I wish they served coffee before 6:30"
"5790",1,"I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Twice! Both times we had problems with the rooms. The first time it was the room that was dirty (used condoms on the floor, found by my grandchildren) they did not come in to clean the room until 10:30pm.On July 3,2011 I also reserved 2 adjoining rooms. The outside of the Hotel was a mess. The plants and trees were all dead. The inside was being remolded and was okay. They workers kept it nice and clean. The girls at the front desk did not seem to know what they were doing! It took two of them to figure where we were supposed to stay and how to charge us. I ended up getting overcharged for the rooms and to make matters worse I was double charged. When I called them, I left a message for the someone to call me back. They said it would be in a half hour. Well one and a half hours later I had to call. They would not put me through to the manager. They even hung up on me. Mind you I was not that upset at that time. I just wwanted to get someone to take care of the problem without me having to tell 5 people. Give me the right one the first time. I finally got the desk manager and she wanted to call me back, I told her no I would not take that chance. She said she would look it up and call me back. Now I am waiting for her call. Wish me luck!Now mind you the hotel was being remodeled and that was fine. But the pool area was dirty! There were glasses on all of the tables and towels laying around. (actually we should pick up after ourselfs). the water was not clean and not clear. We did take our towels out of the rooms with us and took them back in. We asked the desk for clean ones and we got them right away brought to our room. It was 1:p.m. when we were in the pool. this Holiday Inn is the olny hotel close to my brothers house. But believe me next time will stay somewhere esle. I might have to drive further but maybe I will have a better stay!"

I arrived at 2:00 pm for a room which I had pre-paid for and they were out of rooms so they can me an upgrade to a 10th Floor Penthouse suite at no extra cost, it was amazing and very large.I had come a few years later for a weekend function but stayed next door at the Marriott. Suncoast is almost as nice but far cheaper.Sunday Brunch was OK but a good deal for 19.00 ( you get a discount at all restaurants if you get their free membership card). I didn't try other restaurants. They are building a lot of Shops and restaurants across the street.I like the area as well, quiet and close to Red Rock Canyon."
"5793",4,"Stayed at this hotel for one night and the rooms were nice, clean, but slightly small. The staff was very good and made the stay as easy as possible. The lounge had a good crowd and the food was also good. We did use the banquet facilities and the food was fine too."
"5794",4,"This is a surprisingly upscale hotel, with beautiful decor, comfortable rooms and a very helpful and friendly staff.

"5797",4,"This it's the place to stay if you just wanted to relax and not do a whole lot of activities. The price is very decent since you're away from the strip (about a good 15+ mins. away). The rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly. Bowling alley and game room can keep the kids entertained. Ask for a room with golf course view."
"5798",2,"I stayed Monday through Friday on a business trip. When I checked in, I did a quick scan of the room, there was no refrigerator or microwave. I pulled the comforter back and noticed about 7 (what appeared to be) burn holes in the sheet, right by the pillow. I was moved to another room that had a small refrigerator and microwave. The room was dirty, cobwebs in the corner by the old A/C unit. The A/C was very loud and woke me up throughout the night when it would kick in. The chair in front of the unit was stained and not all the lights/fixtures were operational. The fitness area was a mess and the equipment was broken, cups on the floor, empty water container, and towels on the floor. Typical continental breakfast, sometimes there was coffee in the morning, but not every morning."
"5799",4,"When I go to a Courtyard, I always know what I'm getting. Clean, safe, familiar, Starbucks and friendly staff. This hotel did not disappoint and my business trip went fine.

"5804",1,"Not happy because when I got there this was like the umpteenth time that I made a reservation through Hotels.com and not get what I reserved!!!. Makes me want to never use Hotels.com again. The room was run down, snags in the carpet, snags in the towels and sheets. And what made it worse was the side door stayed unlocked all night, drug activity in the parking lot, and there were no cameras in the stairwell from the side door....anybody could have come into the hotel and no one would see it. Very unpleasant stay and unsafe. Will not stay there ever again."

"5816",4,"Nice big room. Was difficult to get to at first but overall a good start."
"5817",2,"They double-charged us for valet parking. For 2 nights we paid over 260 and they have yet to reimburse us. Expect to wait over 45 minutes to have your car fetched from the valet and pre-arrange for them to retrieve it before check-out."

"5828",5,"Staff was very friendly and went out of way to answer question about surrounding area. Our room was very clean and accommodating. Free breakfast was one of the best we have had. While we were eating we saw someone straightening and cleaning area 3 times. Everything was great. Would stay here again if ever in the area."

Main floor smelled of cat litter in some places and some others smelled like cleaning supplies.  Desk staff messed up my room keys when I checked in so I had to go all the way back to lobby to get it fixed.  Staff was friendly and apologized though.  Check out was smooth and easy."
"5832",5,"Located a couple of block from Canal Street in New Orleans, this hotel provided efficient and highly satisfactory service. The front staff is very helpful. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable, more comfortable than in any other hotel I have stayed in. Once I had an almost equally comfortable bed in a Hilton, but this was tops. I would definitely return to this hotel chain.Wow! Thankful you've taken the time to share your great feedback with us and the Trip Advisor community. We have the Westin Heavenly Bed System, they do have some items for retail purchase in case you wanted to check those out. See you next time,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
"5833",5,"Needed to be close to family at a reasons price. Hyatt was perfect for that. I wish the bathroom was a little bit bigger. And I wish the fridge was a little bit colder. Other than those two things, my room was perfect. One elevator was out but it didn't make much difference. Rode the elevator alone most of the time. Didn't seem too crowded in there. There's always someone at the lobby desk with a smile. In the middle of the night, you wouldn't expect that but all the staff I met were super nice and accommodating. I'd stay here again for sure."
"5834",4,"The room itself was as expected. I had no disappointments with the accommodations. The bus service to the strip was an added bonus. Unfortunately, we had a room closest to the IH-15 and facing towards the Las Vegas Strip and Las Vegas Airport. I didn't sleep very well due to the departing airplanes and the shrieks from the patrons riding the roller coaster at the New York, New York hotel. I suggest asking for a room facing away from the strip."
"5835",5,"Great place to stay!! Rooms very clean and comfy beds. Beer garden is a great idea. Good beer, watched the game and good snack goods. Balcony was a nice add on. Perfect weather to enjoy my coffee. I will be back !"
"5836",5,"The London is my favorite West Hollywood Hotel. It's private (just off the Sunset Strip). It's high class elegance and sophistication with a nice dose of hip. The staff is amazing. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The pool deck has an amazing view of Weho and is amazing people watching, all the hip and glamour people are here!"
"5837",3,"We were not able to stay in the hotel for the two nights and went in to cancel only to be told we did not make rez with hotel as we thought we did. We can not get credit for the one nite they told us we could if we cancelled in time. We are in dispute with these charges"
"5838",5,"Is was amazing love everything on the hotel. We have the best 15 anniversary. We definitely go again."
"5839",5,"Hotelxcellent H"
"5840",5,"We stayed there for our honeymoon and it was such a great experience. The front desk gave us the mountain view room on 9th floor, which has an awesome view of the Ala Wai canal and the mountain range. They also gave us a complimentary bottle of red wine. The included breakfast has a good array of food. The location... More"

"5842",5,"The staff was excellent! The only frustration I had was the cost of parking, very expensive."
"5843",4,"This Hampton Inn is just the opposite of the Burbank Hampton. Very friendly staff. Let us check in early without a problem. Clean, comfortable, new - or recently remodeled - room. Lot's of electrical outlets. Big table right near the door for my suitcase. Bathroom had lots of counter space and a long narrow shelf above the sink and below... More"
"5844",4,"I chose this hotel because the room had a kitchen, it was inexpensive, and it was close to the Hampton Convention Center (about 1/3 mile). The room was comfortable and clean, although the armchair, carpet, and bedspread needed to be spot-cleaned. There was a problem with my air conditioning unit which was fixed relatively quickly, even though it was a weekend. The staff was friendly."
"5845",5,"From the moment I walked in the hotel I was impressed. The cleanliness and decor of the front lobby was very impressing and the friendliness of the staff was very noticeable. I had just had surgery and requested 4 additional pillows at the front counter. By the time we got to the room, the concierge service had already delivered them.... More"
"5846",4,"The room was nice, but a bit small. The beds were supposed to be Queen Size, but were definitely smaller than Queen. The swimming pool was pretty small, too. Breakfast was pretty good."
"5847",4,"Another sub-par breakfast menu Jacuzzi was Very Nice."
"5848",5,"The hotel staff was friendly and helpful at any hour of the day or night. Food was hot and freshly prepared. The only down-side was the fire alarms went off 3 of the 4 nights we were there - twice with cause and once accidentally. The shuttle service is a great plus and staff willingly took us to/from the Metro station every day. Even though the location seems a little far from downtown DC, it's extremely convenient to the Metro and other amenities in the neighborhood. For a mid-range hotel, it's quite comfortable. Extra kudos to Stacey :-)"
"5849",4,"Got lucky finding this place. I'd been on the road 13 hours and started falling asleep at the wheel so I stopped at the next exit with a motel sign. The entrance is not obvious but not too hard to find. After exiting the Interstate, go the direction sign says. Then turn left beside gas station and left again at... More"
"5850",5,"Clean comfortable hotel. Dennis the shuttle driver provided a tour into Newport and back to the hotel that was better than paid tours in Boston and Manhattan we have been on. He was the highlight of our trip. We are frequent visitors to Newport but never knew the history. We learned the different neighborhoods and restaurant choices other than harbor side. Breakfast on his recommendation was great! The free breakfast at Hampton is not why we stay there. The cleanliness and security is the most important feature to us. Someone needs to recognize Dennis for his efforts!! We will be back because of this A1 service.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel with the TripAdvisor community. We appreciate your kind words and compliments regarding the cleanliness, comfort and security of our location. I will be certain to share your accolades with Dennis who will be thrilled to receive them. He is a tremendous asset to our team. We look forward to having you as our guests again upon your return to Newport. Again, thank you for your feedback."

"5854",4,"I love so many things about The Viceroy. It's in a perfect location right in the heart of Santa Monica. The staff is friendly and helpful, the design is beautiful, the common areas are gorgeous, rooms are smaller but very nicely appointed and the pool is small and somewhat shaded but overall it's a wonderful hotel."
"5855",3,"Very impressed with the scene when I walked in. Didn't take me long to realize that the Ace has focused on aesthetics rather than service. I arrived 90 minutes after check in time. Took them over 30 minutes to get it ready. In the meantime, I had to first deal with a smug wannabe hipster and then a woman who... More"
"5856",2,"Bad: Thumping music all night long. So loud the windows vibrated."
"5857",4,"The shuttle to Bricktown is very convenient. Really good breakfast."
"5858",4,"Bad: Had to wait in line for 45 minutes to check in not enough staff to help. Room was not ready for an hour after check in."
"5859",4,"Home2 Suites is a new hotel with modern decor. The room was nice with a small kitchen, table and desk and couch. The only drawback of the room was the bed was placed right next to the air conditioning unit, which is quite loud when your head is right next to it. The room was a good size."
"5860",5,"Stayed at the Charles Hotel over Christmas / New Year with the family. The room, staff and hotel in general were brilliant. I particularly recommend the hotel restaurant, Henrietta's Table, serves marvellous locally-sourced food."
"5861",5,"An excellent team to assist you. Opt for the valet parking. Nice rooms restaurant on site, front desk service available for your needs. Closest hotel to aquarium. Walking distance to Phillips arena. Well priced value for sure."
"5862",5,"My friends and I decided to try out this little but beautiful hotel on Pine Creek this year for our annual overnight bike ride. We were not disappointed. It was all we expected and more.

"5864",5,"Complimentary breakfast is offered which is great when you're on a family trip. Located near the metro station and with many restaurants and stores in the surrounding area."
"5865",5,"Everyone went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable."
"5866",5,"Los cuartos muy limpios la limpieza en la alberca eso me gusto mucho todos los dias la limpian y le dedican tiempo a q quede todo bien eso se aprecia"
"5867",4,"The hotel staff was great as was the location. The only thing I'd say needs improvement is the actual building and rooms. The rooms seemed a bit old and could use major renovations. But for the price we paid with a last minute booking we were happy with the accomodations."
"5868",5,"Had a 7:30am tour of the White House and wanted to be near public transportation (New Carrolton Station). Metro Points fit the bill and was recently renovated. A good price from Expedia sealed the deal for us. Upon arrival we found the staff to be helpful and friendly. The two adjoining rooms were clean and well appointed. Local amenities offered a wide choice of restaurants, and a local IHOP was open 24x7 to support our early morning breakfast and travel needs. MetroPoint even provided a 15 discount. We would definitely stay again."
"5869",5,"I enjoyed the convenience of the location and having the Whole Foods store within walking distance was a plus."
"5870",5,"Overall great stay. Clean modern hotel with friendly staff. Free internet. Very nice breakfast with individualized orders. Rooms were very comfortable and modern. Bathroom spacious. My first stay in Aloft hotels. Will return to this chain."
"5871",4,"it was nice!"
"5872",1,"Room was dirty, black hairs and grass on bathroom floor, tub liner was disgusting, old tube style TV and only had 1 washer and 1 dryer. I have a handicap and was put on the 2nd floor about 11-12 rooms away from the elevator. No luggage carts available which made it difficult for me to bring up my belongings. I would NOT recommend this Super 8 even though it was close to all we wanted to see in the Dayton area."
"5873",5,"Good: Excellent location and great continental breakfast"
"5874",5,"Good: breakfast in room!"
"5875",5,"We go back every other year and always stay here. The location is perfect, the hotel extremely well maintained and the service a cut above. There truly is no other place we would stay when in town. The proximity to the market and restaurants also makes it one of the most convenient."
"5876",5,"This will always be our travel destination to and from Colorado. Clean, comfortable, and reasonable rates.Thank you for making the Ellis Days Inn your choice overnight stay! We appreciate your comments and look forward to your next stay. Be sure to follow us on our facebook page, Days Inn of Ellis."
"5877",5,"This is a great hotel. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and courteous. Checking in and checking out was very simple without any wait time. The hotel room was spotless along with the lobby and other facilities. I highly recommend staying here."
"5878",5,"Staff does a very nice job. The second location I have stayed at and both experiences have been great. Close to downtown Franklin, 20 minutes to downtown Nashville. Very quiet and comfortable. Our stay at their location in Findlay, Ohio was equal to this."
"5879",4,"I usually stay at the HI Express, but their rate was way too high for me this time. This hotel was just fine. Like other Comfort Inns, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, TV had enough channels, and there was a decent breakfast. I will probably come back again."
"5880",3,"Got a king room for special rate. Had late flight in so unable to comment on evening snacks and drinks. Breakfast was good. Room was nice and clean, however, would not stay here if not for the special rate received."
"5881",4,"Bad: everything ok. Good: all good"
"5882",3,"I've stayed in so many Chicago hotels I lost count. This location is excellent. The front desk staff was very helpful and hip. Room very modern, large and included a fridge and pull out comfy chair. Parking was only 36 per 24 hours here. Recalling that you are in a big city here and not some country estate, would night noise from the Loop be a surprise Would a panhandler on the sidewalk be a shock Of course not. If these things are disturbing to you, don't stay here. If you crave peace and quiet, four star ambiance and price, you should go up to the Peninsula. The Italian restaurant in the building is very charming and did I mention the building is an architectural masterpiece by Herbert Hugh Riddle, 1928 Its a gem."
"5883",1,"no breakfast on time or donuts from the frige, no Service, no place for garbage, water in bathtub don't run away, durty floor etc.etc. a horrible experience!!! we are from Germany and our american English is not as good to write more Details."
"5884",5,"Rm 314 was great! I chose this room because of the oversized clawfoot tub. It would be great for a longer stay since it's basically a one bedroom appartment with a full kitchen, 4 seat dining table and separate living room. There is no view from this room but who cares! I had a romantic weekend planned and time out... More"
"5885",5,"We were looking for a hotel at the last minute. As soon as we walk in the staff were very courteous and friendly, very helpful in finding the best pricing and fulfilling my hotel needs. I was serviced by Davian, she was very willing and helpful. I commended her for the outstanding service she provide. Next time we visit Key West this will be our place to stay.Dear Catherine A,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel.

"5886",5,"I can't begin to describe how incredible this hotel is!! Service was beyond my expectations. Their devotion to 100 satisfaction was evident everywhere we went from the bar, the pool, room service, check-in/check-out, and valet. I am proud that my city has such a hotel to represent!!! I most definitely will return!"
"5887",5,"Boyfriend wanted to treat to casino stay for Valentine's Day weekend but were booked and we got referred here. Never stayed at one of these and very glad we did.

"5888",2,"60's Era building, but updated with microwave, hair dryer etc. No elevator for the second floor."
"5889",5,"Good: service was prompt and friendly."
"5890",4,"We enjoyed our stay except there were a couple of family reunions going on and the hotel was very full. We were on the third floor and could hear people taking outside all night. Called the desk 2 days in a row and they said they would take care of it, but did not. 2 bad nights of sleep."
"5891",5,"I chose this place due to the trip advisor reviews and I can agree that it is a great little place. I was travelling by myself for work and I was immediately made very welcome. The room was clean and tidy and the bed was super comfortable. Every evening the staff put out some wine and nibbles from 5-7pm. I... More"
"5892",3,"When we checked in and proceded up to our room, we went into the room to find they had a maintainence worker still working on something in the bathroom! They had no other rooms available, so they just hurried him up with whatever he was fixing. Tour groups of young adults, who seemed to have no supervision, were allowed to run up and down the hallways and stairs at all hours of the night! They even had ball games they were playing in the halls, and were calling other guests rooms with prank phone calls. When we called down to complain (about 11:00PM), we were told we needed to be patient! This went on every night of the trip, and we were there 8 days!"
"5893",5,"Excellent friendly and accommodating staff. Close to shopping and restaurants. Great hot tub, workout room and pool. Breakfast was good. Close to Brewery and wineries and attractions including Watkins Glenn raceway. We would definitely stay here again."
"5894",5,"Bad: Need more than 2 small drawers The pillows given were too hard but when replaced w down - perfect!. Good: The breakfast was just enough for busy travelers served on each floor. The cocktails on the 6th floor was wonderful. The rooms were exceptionally clean and the beds were very comfortable The staff Gabriel, Rachel and Drake went out of their way to make our stay wonderful I would recommend this hotel highly"
"5895",1,"Our stay was very bad . It started off with waiting to check in for an hour. Then when we got to our room our bed sheets had a whole in it and not to mention our Toilet would not flush . When I went down to complain about it the front deal receptionist had an attitude . For Over 200 a night I would expect to be treated better and the hotel to be updated . I would never ever say here again ."
"5896",4,"This hotel is, to put it gently, a little out of the way. But it's close to major routes (93, 495) and the town of Andover is a short drive away as are Lowell and Lawrence. So being tucked into the woods gives it the advantage of being very quiet. The facility is clean, cool and comfortable. The rooms are... More"
"5897",5,"This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. It's very close to the Atlanta airport, which is convenient, although we did hear the planes off and on. It has a small Starbucks inside the lobby, and fresh salads and wraps for purchase anytime also."
"5898",5,"The location of the Charlottesville Hyatt Place is excellent with a variety of food in walking distance. University of Virginia very accessible from this location. Front desk offered directions and guidance."
"5899",5,"Bad: We only had one robe in our room and no slippers, but we weren't bothered enough to ask for these from the front desk. Good: We loved our stay at the W Boston! The room was a great size and the bed huge and comfortable. The staff was so accommodating taking delivery of two packages for me and bringing them up to the room. I didn't use the Bliss spa on site, but it is an amazing spa so I will definitely visit next time!"
"5900",4,"Great time at the Honua Kai Just returned from a 2 week stay at the Honua Kai with my husband and 6 year old daughter. Would would stay here again for sure. Here are my candid thoughts. Likes: - I booked with a membership code and saved 40 off of the best advertised rate available from the resort directly ...... More"
"5901",3,"We recently spent one night at the Best Western in Lake Placid. It is conveniently located near the center of town, across from the skating arena. The facility is adequate, and offers a complementary breakfast. The parking is very difficult and it is not easy to get an SUV out of the parking lot area."
"5902",4,"The front desk person was extremely nice and helpful. He allowed us to change our room three times before we (my wife who's pregnant) settled on a room that was easy to walk to and from elevator, able to see vehicle from room window, and right side orientation. The free breakfast buffet was a BIG plus! The indoor pool and hot tub were clean and very nice to enjoy with visiting family for Christmas!"
"5903",4,"This is a good clean hotel with plenty of parking (many downtown Charleston hotels have parking issues). The rooms were fine, and each had a balcony (although, not much of a balcony). Full breakfast included."
"5904",1,"Very clean hotel but staff from the minute checked in just felt like they had better things to do with their time and really would rather be somewhere else. We would ask them questions and they either ignored us or their person conversations were more important. Will not be staying there again."
"5905",5,"Right on the beach and close to the shops. not to far from all the bars and grill off the boardwalk . the guest service was great. Yolanda the office person was very nice and sweet. will deff stay here again next year."
"5906",4,"Good: Coffee and juice were nice to start out the day with! Cold cereal would have been a plus."
"5907",4,"This facility was very good with one caveat - door to room was in need of maintenance attention - not urgent and the staff was notified at checkout. The checkin and checkout was easy and the staff friendly. The location is near I-285 Interstate, with traffic lights to help access on to/off of the busy hour traffic. The breakfast area... More"
"5908",5,"Bad: nothing to complain about. staff very helpful. Good: bed extra comfy"
"5909",5,"Bad: Probably my oversight when Iread the description but I was surprised to find no mini fridge in the room. Good: Close to Colonial Williamsburg, clean with a friendly staff, and two great pools. The pools gave us downtime opportunity on a rainy day as well as on a sunny day."
"5910",4,"Bad: Room is clean, I expected room would be bigger but not,Paid about 230. Good: Good customer service and room is clean"
"5911",4,"We needed a nice, reasonably priced, comfortable, fun place to stay while visiting schools with our son - this was perfect! We loved the Adirondack decor, the spacious room, good breakfast and friendly staff. Thanks."
"5912",5,"I love the small size overall. This is my third time here because I tag along while my husband is at a conference. The pool is perfect, with full sun AND cabanas. There is a wide choice of restaurants and all are well served. We saw a movie while there and had a nice choice of current movies."
"5913",3,"Convenient location and overall pleasant, one night stay, but rooms and common areas, hallways, pool, need some maintenance--chipping paint and bathroom grout, and we found a dirty washcloth left behind hanging on the shower curtain rod."
"5914",1,"This motel is dated and extremely dirty. Everything about this place makes me want to RUN away as far as possible. The carpeted floors were very dirty and were NOT vacuumed. You could see fingernail clippings and food particles, just to name a few. There was a dirty towel and someone's sock right behind the dresser--this will let you know... More"
"5915",1,"We had 10 rooms asked the GM in advance to put the rooms close she said she would do her best. At check in, the front desk never received anything from their GM about our group. The hotel was dirty, online pics are deceiving. The rooms reeked of smoke some of us changed rooms. There was hair everywhere. I never saw a cleaning lady the entire time. There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out. This is not a family friendly hotel in any way, shape or form, DO NOT bring your kids here. If you want a cheap party hotel with a club where you can pass out drunk not care, this is right up your alley. Do yourself a favor spend the extra money."
"5916",5,"We got to check in early! This is a perfect location for Bricktown entertainment and great food! Clean room and friendly staff! There is piano bar across the street and great places to eat within walking distance!Dear Susan G, So happy that your experience was perfect!!! We hope to see you again soon!! Thank you for the review!! Sincerely, Carolyn Temple"
"5917",4,"My wife got a message while we were there and loved it. Parking is a bit cluttered as they must park cars for people on Monhegan Island. Joe is a bit anal about the parking situation but is a real nice guy. Pat was great. We only stayed 2 days and could have stayed longer,"
"5918",3,"We stayed here on the last night of a cycling trip from Jax Beach to Sarasota, FL. The location on our route was perfect, but beyond that, it was a disappointment.

"5919",4,"Didn't stay long enough to really review things, but the room was pretty clean, even though I think my toilet was leaking. Speaking of toilets, you kinda have to jump over it to get to the shower which has a really low shower head. Not good for a 6' tall person. Be wary of the elevator, it's kinda creepy. Didn't get to check out the pool, but it looked decent enough. Friendly front desk service. Not the best location as far as traffic goes, but it's 15 minutes from most anything (amphitheater, beach, etc) so it was a pretty good spot to spend the night. If you're wanting an ocean-view, look elsewhere. It's worth the price I paid."
"5920",3,"The hotel is in need of some repairs, it was in a good location but I won't recommend it I think you could have gotten a nicer room for the price"
"5921",5,"We stayed in this quaint motel for 4 nights while in Santa Monica. Prior to arrival we were tossed between staying here for 2 nights and then going to Hollywood for 2 nights.

"5926",1,"Please look at Google reviews for TRUE REVIEW!"
"5927",4,"Everything was great. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and made you feel comfortable. Would recommend to anyone and would stay here again when I am in the area."
"5928",2,"Stayed here for one night. Saw suspicious people hanging out in the parking lot by the pool area. We arrived late at night.

"5932",4,"The Fairfield Inn Suites Key West at The Keys Collection in Key West, was a clean hotel, a little out of Key West. There was a shuttle into Key West proper, but it was crowded do to other hotels in the same area give the shuttle free as a perk, at the Fairfield Inn it was 20/ day/ room. We did some things on the side of the island that the Inn on. Key West Botanical Garden, and Lazy Dog Kayak and Paddle Boards which were both great. Overall a good stay, Marriott has to update their breakfasts, have stayed in many Marriott properties, the breakfast is always the same.Dear Thomas M,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"
"5933",5,"Stayed for the weekend and the only thing I would change is that a free continental breakfast would be nice. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Harrisburg."
"5934",4,"Enjoyed my stay at the Suncoast, I was in for a wedding with my daughter and there were plenty of things to do for the kids. I enjoyed the movie theater and bowling alley which kept us occupied in between family events. The rooms are very good as well. Ventilation was not the best in the casino on the first day and you could smell more smoke than normal."
"5935",5,"The room was really comfortable and clean. This is huge for me As I am really picky about rooms and hotels. The experience from beginning to end was seamless and I appreciated the hospitality given by the staff during my stay."
"5936",5,"Bad: Room servicing late in the day. Good: Great hotel. Friendly staff."
"5937",5,"Hyatt Place was in a great location. Tons of restaurants nearby and short walking distance to the harbor. The rooms were so neat and clean and so comfortable. I really enjoyed it. The only downfall was parking. The hotel doesn't have its own parking garage. They do have Valet parking but it was too expensive. Good thing there was a municipal parking garage right behind the hotel that was cheap because there wasn't a lot of street parking nearby. We ended up taking ubers to other locations that were longer distances so we didn't have to go in and out of the parking garage and pay each time."
"5938",4,"Bad: The bathroom needs to be upgraded. It is very worn, the brown wall paper was dirty and the paint on the sink counter was pealing off. was also disappointed the room did not have a coffee maker. I like to have a cup while I get dressed in the mornings. would have liked a non-smoking area in the casino. I am a non-smoker and I had to keep taking breaks and go outside for fresh air. Good: The Beds were great! The location was very good. The gentleman at the Registration desk was very helpful and friendly. And the Lady at the Keno lounge was nice too."

"5941",5,"I was lucky to be upgraded to a lovely Jr suite with great views of the lake and park. Unfortunately, I was only in town for 24 hours so I couldn't fully enjoy the hotel."
"5942",5,"Hotel is very easy to get to. Rooms were excellent as we were there for a shopping trip. Breakfast is a bit crowded on Sunday as most guests are leaving on the buses,other than that no problems"
"5943",5,"I recently stayed at this hotel while attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center. This hotel is about a mile from the convention center but the hotel has a shuttle for free. My room was very clean and welcoming. My only minor issue with the hotel is the HVAC system in the room does not allow for fan on at all time. I prefer this while sleeping.Dear Hunterhersh: Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at the Hyatt House Seattle. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I greatly appreciate your kind words and they will be celebrated with the entire team. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the location and our free shuttle. I will investigate the HVAC system, i am sorry that this was was an inconvenience for you! If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We look forward to being of service to you in the near future. We appreciate your business! Sincerely, Jonathan"
"5944",5,"The Chalet is a great place to stay when visiting Mooshead Lake. Huge property with lots of space to relax and enjoy the outdoors and the lake. They let guests use canoes, kayaks and paddleboats. Tghis is also a pet friendly motel. The owners are visible, helpful and friendly. Walking distance to the village area and a great value."
"5945",2,"Hotel is dated and needs updating. Free continental breakfast was a disappointment. Will not stay here again."
"5946",4,"My wife and I stayed at the Comfort Suites over Memorial Day weekend and used it as a jumping point for the 4 days we were there.

"5947",4,"I stayed her while coordinating a class in one of the hotel's meeting rooms. As the meeting planner, I was upgraded to a wonderful room on the 10th floor. It had a bar, living room, dining area, large separate bedroom and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a huge shower. The bed was very comfortable. The meeting facility is very well run, and worth consideration if you have an event. While there is a large selection of restaurants in the casino, I only patronized two: The Cafe Sienna served up a decent, inexpensive early bird breakfast special. The Bagel Cafe Express has pretty good sandwiches, although they seemed a bit pricey. Otherwise, I preferred to get out and eat somewhere else. Across the street are a Cheesecake Factory and a Gordon Biersch Brewpub that are both great places to eat."
"5948",2,"I guess they don't care about the little critters that creep around the room. We informed the front desk and all they said was, hum. We usually have the rooms sprayed! Found two centipedes and spiders crawling around."
"5949",5,"I was very happy. We needed dinner and a quick night's sleep. The area was great and we had many choices for food. Kind of odd there are no glasses in the room, just two foam coffee cups."
"5950",1,"Do not stay here!!! THIS IS THE WORST! I had a horrible experience. The hotel is smells like fish. Their is a swamp located outside the door that you enter your room. Management does not call you back when you have problems. I had to call the corporate office in order to get a call back from them.The tub got... More"
"5951",5,"We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again."
"5952",4,"The room was great!! We stayed in an Executive level room. The front desk staff wasn't very friendly. They had a lifeguard on duty at the pool all the time which was nice. The breakfast was very good with a nice variety of foods. It's very convenient to the metro. Free parking at the hotel was a plus. It is the last stop on the metro which at first we thought was a bad thing but ended up being good since we always had a seat in the morning on the way to D.C. Overall, I would recommend this hotel especially for the price. It's also very convenient to the Springfield Mall which is currently closed due to renovation but should open next year."
"5953",5,"great hotel within walking distance of Clinton Library and the capitol and all many places to eat and the service was great, just be aware parking is shared with a condo ,but plenty of parking and its 7 dollars a night extra but cheaper then anywhere in any other downtown city in USA"

"5955",2,"You want to hear about my stay Well,,,, the first room that I was issued the heater did not work. The second room I was issued the TV did not work. At the end of the day the last thing I want to do is be shuffled around from room to room!!!!!! The cleaning crews are ether not trained correctly, or dont care. The floor in the bathroom was dirty and had long ladies hair all over. I wont be stopping there EVER again!!!! You wanted to hear about it,,,, now you have!!!! What will you do Lets see!!!"

"5976",3,"We were given rooms at this hotel on Hotwire. The location was great and the staff was very helpful and friendly, but our room and bathroom/shower were very small and the bed was hard as a rock. It seems standard these days that 1-bed rooms will be outfitted with a King bed and 2-bed rooms with 2 Queens or at least Doubles. Our room had a Queen bed which took up most of the room and my mom and brother's room had 2 Twins! The TV was extremely tiny compared to any other hotel I've stayed at and my 6'2 husband had a hard time taking in shower in the tiny space. Wouldn't stay here again due to the uncomfortable room."

"5980",3,"Our room smelled like smoke, and they had no other rooms to offer us. I found a spider in the bed when I rolled back the sheets to go to bed. Just didn't think the price was matched by the value. We also were not impressed with the powdered scrambled eggs in the breakfast buffet."
"5981",4,"I booked this room for a concert my husband and I went to. We only needed the room one night but opted for the king suite. Rooms was great, breakfast was willing. You have to walk a little to get to places but if we could do it in the frigid AC air, anyone can. Highly reccomend!"

"5997",5,"One of the best hotels I stayed. A++"
"5998",3,"Bad: The hotel is very outdated. Old rooms (we were moved because of an old airco that made a lot of noise), old elevators, tiny beds that should not be sold as double unless you like sleeping on top of each other, mediocre breakfast with very little healthy options (mind you, a 7 extra charge for a cappuccino is outrageous). Very basic pool area. All in all we would give this hotel a good 3 stars. Not more. Good: Location is ok."
"5999",5,"This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again."

"6010",5,"Great stay at this hotel. The staff are wonderful! The hotel is very close to City Hall and Reading Terminal. Great outdoor patio and fun lobby. The rooms are nice and bed comfortable. Hallways are a little narrow but is an older renovated building. Definitely would stay here again."
"6011",5,"The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect."
"6012",5,"The two days I spent at your Best Western Inn near the Rochester airport, was great before and after my sons graduation ceremony from RIT college. The breakfast every morning was delicious and definitely worth getting up early for. I really enjoyed my stay at this location."
"6013",3,"First it looks like something happen in the beach and a bunch of dead fish are laying on the sand, as soon as the sun comes out the smell is extremely bad. Secondly the rooms are set not to allow the AC to lower below 70 that made the room uncomfortable and third we where in the room for three days and the minibar wasn't re-stocked or was the sugars for the coffee maker or tea, it looks like only one elevator was working and it took forever!"
"6014",3,"Overall I rate this hotel as average in some areas, and above in others. First the good: Price considering the Napa Valley location it was a good value, at check in we received our free breakfast coupons for Denny's adjacent to hotel. The location makes it easy to get downtown, or cross the bridge to Hwy 29. Staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful, its like they get it be friendly to your guests and they will either return or recommend your hotel to others.Average in outside noise is noticeable, doors closing, street noise, people walking in rooms above you, showers in the morning...etc. Hotel is somewhat dated yet clean and pretty well cared for.I would stay here again.Thank you for staying with us. We are always working on upgrading our Hotel. We are in the process of adding a workout room, guest laundry and business center. Customer service is always number one with us and we will see you again on your next visit to the Napa."
"6015",5,"Was not pleased that it rained my stay because I did not have a chance to visit the pool. The food at the grill was really good! Great turkey club and burger!! Awesome drinks......needed more alcohol but good. Shuttle from airport little slow but staff wanted to make you comfortable."

"6032",5,"The hotel is up to date and very clean. The rooms have flat screen televisions and new beds. The staff is very helpful and had many good recommendations for good food nearby. The breakfast was of good quality and had good selection. The managers reception on weeknights was also a plus!"

"6034",5,"The rooms are HUGE. Parking is the cheapest I've seen at any hotel in Arlington. It isn't right in the city, but it is definitely worth the cab (or hotel shuttle ride) into downtown. Always extremely clean. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I really can't say enough. This was my sixth time staying at the Virginian Suites and I keep coming back. Love it!"
"6035",1,"Garbage hotel beware do not use the toxic water there if you shower in it you will smell like waste water"

We only stayed one night here because our other hotel was booked for the rest of the trip but I will definitely be staying here the next time I come to Vegas for my entire trip. Great location"
"6048",5,"Since I was meeting a friend coming in at Midway, and being able to shop at the mall right next door, and eat at an IHOP, also right next door in that mall... Everything to make that weekend easy and fun was close at hand.Plus I had to remind myself where I was when I woke up each morning, because the bed was firm, like my own bed at home, so I was very comfortable."
"6049",5,"This place was awesome. From the moment you step in, and you have fresh-baked cookies and lemonade waiting for you... you know it's going to be a great stay.

"6051",4,"Super 8 has come a long way in recent years. This one looks great from exterior, has friendly staff - something I have notice across the country in past couple of years. The room has a few nicks and scuffs around the edges, but is clean and comfortable. This is not a 5 star place, but ease of access from... More"

"6053",5,"The hotel was very clean and the room was comfortable. Off the main drag so there wasn't a lot of traffic noise. The only downfall is that there isn't a continental breakfast. They did have a cupboard where you could purchase food and other items which helped out."
"6054",3,"Hotels.com messed up my reservation but the hotel was able to get me a room anyway. The location is good, right at the end of uptown Sedona so you can walk to shops and restaurants. However, it is really pricey and I don't think it warrants such a high price. Room was nice but nothing special. I would recommend staying... More"
"6055",5,"Yes, it was convenient and our expectations of a Marriott property that were well met. Our room was spacious and very adequate, and in fact exceeded our expectations. Henry Jones checked us in with cordial and competent ease. The evening was restful and uneventful, the breakfast was exceptional. It is a 4 star hotel."
"6056",5,"staff was very helpful,breakfast included really makes a difference when you travel.clean and close to all major roads. this location also makes it nice due to a walking down down type of area with shops and many types of eateries available. also a food stor in the next parking lot."

"6061",4,"I stayed over for few nights. It is clean and quite modern. Bed are comfortable and is located in a quite neighbourhood. The Hotel staff is very kind and friendly. For shopping lovers, it is also very close to Market. I would recommend it."
"6062",4,"Gorgeous sheets and comfy beds, flat screen TV. The room was nice and quiet. Great location to visit key areas of Napa and very close to downtown . Staff was very friendly. The only thing we missed was a safe in our room. Reasonable prices for July.Thank you for your review. I am glad you enjoyed your stay. Come back and see us again."

The location is perfect for walking to many touristy spots. We even walked to and from union station. Thank you for staying with us recently and for your kind recommendation both are greatly appreciated! We are pleased to hear that you are a great fan of the River Hotel and delighted that your granddaughter had a wonderful stay. We agree -- our prime location in the heart of the city is perfect for experiencing all that Chicago has to offer.We look forward to welcome you back to the River Hotel very soon!"

"6070",4,"Bad: Outlook from room. Good: Staff helpfulness Well designed use of limited space"
"6071",4,"Spent 5 wonderful days at the Pioneer Inn. Great place. Loved the rooms and the outside deck, comfortable beds, coffee maker, great location and friendly staff. Walking distance to everything. Would definitely stay here again when visiting Maui."
"6072",4,"Very clean hotel, good breakfast, good value for your money. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars... the single bed rooms are small. I did not get a chance to use the pool, but pool room looked extremely clean as well."
"6073",5,"The Embassy Suites Lithicum provided a high quality venue for our youth baseball team as we participated in a tournament that weekend. The team loved the atmosphere and ambiance of this Hilton brand hotel. It is among the nicer hotels that we now stay in due to an experience that we had with the standard accomodations at popular hotel chains such as DI, M6, S8, HJ, etc. The cook to order breakfast was a bonus. My only complaint would be is that it is a loud hotel on the weekend with special events and people constantly hanging out of there rooms on the atrium. It would also be great to at least provide free wireless in the common areas. The fee for wireless was almost 10/day and the business center was always full."
"6074",1,"Save your money- this was the worst hotel in which I have EVER stayed!!! We should have just turned around and left when we pulled into the hotel parking lot and saw a police cruiser sitting out front. The hotel stay went downhill from there. The side lot of the hotel is poorly lit and we did not feel safe parking there. There were ants in the shower, the linens were ripped, and the window had a 1/2 inch of dirt on the sill. Supplies to make a cup of coffee were in the room, but there was no coffee maker. We called the front desk to arrange for shuttle to the casino and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. After 30 minutes, we walked out to the front desk to find out how much longer it would be. The staff informed us that they had forgotten to put us on the list for the shuttle... we would have been waiting forever!! I plugged my cellphone in to charge overnight, and awoke to find that it had not charged at all... the outlet had no power supply."
"6075",5,"Perfect hotel for a single female traveller. The hotel was clean, convenient, and steps away from major attractions. Easy to access by public transportation. The room is smaller than average, but not too small, and the perfect size for a traveller who is not planning on spending much time in the hotel room anyway. Computers with internet access a plus. Friendly staff. The only gripe I had was the elevators...there are only two of them, so visitors can wait a while for them to arrive."
"6076",5,"I travel a bunch and lean toward staying at Marriott locations. I was delighted to have spent several weeks at the Residence Inn in Richardson Texas. Location, consistency, cleanliness and good people on staff. Lisa, Johanna, Josh, Laila, Linda, Sylvia, Sheila and Vanessa all were welcoming and helpful. Thank you all!"

"6082",4,"Hotel was everything we needed. Feel kinda bad for the two women who were running the breakfast room - they were a bit overburdened at times. But they marched on with smiles and a good attitude - but especially with some items being made to order - they could use one more hand!"
"6083",1,"Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient location in the city centre walkable to most attractions"
"6084",4,"The rooms were outdated. But they were clean and very comfortable. The hotel has so much potential but it's not being used as it should. I would def stay here again. Price was good. Breakfast was a little disappointing but it worked for what we needed.  The shower was really nice. Endless hot water.  Tv channels we a let down. But we were so sleepy we didn't care.   Will stay here again."
"6085",3,"Let's start wth the positives. The location is good, easy to get anywhere. The price was good. The front desk was quick and professional, not super friendly, but professional. That's about it for positives. The hotel is extremely dated. The beds are tiny and uncomfortable. The room is in disrepair, broken lights, rusty doorways, loose outlets. We found a nasty... More"

"6091",5,"Bad: Need higher wattage light bulbs in bedside lamps. Larger pillows for bed. Good: Like the character of the hotel. Unique. Nostalgic. Bars and restaurant are fun. Friendly staff. Good food. Reasonable prices."
"6092",4,"I stayed here the weekend of September 25th and had a relaxing stay. The location is a little odd but otherwise I have no complaints. It's close to the mall and numerous restaurants, overall a reasonable stay."
"6093",5,"I needed a clean comfortable room at the last minute due to my being called back to work at the last minute, and The Metro Points fit the bill. Special Thanks to Lavere (front desk) for his professionalism kindness."
"6094",5,"Sirea and Sylvia were awesome, both deserve a raise. Both totally went out of their way to help me with anything I needed. And made my stay enjoyable and not so lonely by striking up conversations with me. Which means a lot when you are away from home. The rest of the staff was wonderful as well. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Will retun."
"6095",2,"This hotel is in an area of Richmond that is less than desirable. We booked it because it wasn't far from Richmond airport where we arrived late evening and didn't want to travel far our first night in Virginia. Waited at front desk for 15 minutes before someone showed up to check us in. The price was right and the... More"
"6096",4,"We rested here for the night on New Years Eve. It was a easy find and had affordable rates. Can't complain about the room for the price. The bathroom was a bit small and the double queen beds wasn't the biggest, but it was a comfortable place to spend NYE with the family."
"6097",4,"Room was quiet. Pool and hot tub available, which was a nice perk."
"6098",5,"This hotel more than met our expectations, very close to the metro station, 5-10 mins walk, but a free shuttle bus operates anyway so you don't have to walk. Very close to Washington and Arlington Cemetery. The neighbourhood felt safe and we had no fear of walking out even late at night, highly recommended."
"6099",2,"My grandson was locked in the bathroom for 45 minutes due to faulty bathroom door locks. Hotel staff had no idea on how to get him out. My husband figured out what the problem was with the door and got him out. Now my grandson never wants to stay in any hotel ever again!!! Traumatic experience!!"

The elevator was just a little slow so we took stairs most of time since... More"
"6102",5,"Stayed here from October 12-18th. Excellent location, away from the hustle and bustle of the strip traffic. Great eating places around, shopping for ones who like to shop. One the greatest bingo halls ever. I came her in April and won 46,080.00 playing bingo, came back this time and my husband won 1430.00 playing bingo and then won another 500.00 when they called his name on a raffle drawing.Rooms are to die for, absolutely beautiful, had a wonderful view of the city, mountains and golf course. Next door also in two other casinos to enjoy, and 5minutes away is the beautiful Red Rock Casino.The slots are also nice to play, did not win a lot, but stayed alive and did not lose my shirt.Will definitely be coming back to stay."
"6103",3,"Bad: I don't really know why this hotel has such a high rating. It's decent, but definitely not worth 3* and 300+ I paid for the room. Nothing in particular, but just the entire feel and look of it was more in the 2*, 150-200 range. Also, there were some road works taking place just outside the hotel at 7AM that produced insufferable noise, so I wish I had known that before booking."
"6104",3,"I have stayed for New Year's Holiday.I was looking forward to visiting this hotel very very much. and I requested to them that I would like a high floor at their web site while reservation. as a result,my timeline on arrival day is following.11:30 arrival at Hotel,and deposit luggage. the representative of reception saidWe accept your request. at this time.15:45 Challenge for the first check-in.

As part of their fine hotel's program, we booked for 2 days and the third night was comped. It also included 100.00 towards meals and complete breakfast for 2. Upon checking in, Hugo acknowledged me as a Platinum SPG guest and upgraded us to the Madison Suite! Every room comes with a butler, who will bring you complimentary tea or coffee service. There's a house Bentley which is available on a first come,first served basis.

"6109",3,"While everything was ""OK"", there was nothing special or even extra OK about this hotel. The walls are paper thin, it's right off of the freeway, no free breakfast........ Just OK."
"6110",4,"Very comfortable and plush accommodations at a reasonable price right off Foothills Blvd. Beds were especially comfortable. Breakfast was a little disappointing but varied enough that there was something for everyone"
"6111",4,"Stayed with many family members attending a family reunion in 6 different rooms. Most room numbers began with 1 so an incorrect assumption was that the rooms were on the first floor. The hotel seems to be on a slight rise and has different levels for the same floor. Our rooms on the same floor were either accessed via entrance 2, which required some stairs or entrance 3 which required no stairs. Note that there is no elevator. Some issues with a couple of rooms, but hotel staff was quick to rectify. My room included a refrigerator and a microwave. Breakfast in the conference room below had make your own waffles, hard-boiled eggs, toast and muffins, and oatmeal - coffee, tea, and juice."
"6112",5,"This is a family owned operation. The owners themselves see to your needs. Dan Jenson even helped us carry our luggage to the room when we arrived.

"6116",3,"Overall it wasn't a horrible stay. We wanted a suite since we were travelling with a baby and child. We were also going to disnleyland and wanted to be able to prep our lunches and come back to make dinner. The kitchens had everything you need!. The breakfast provided each morning was impressive. We first booked into a studio which didn't have a functioning bathtub so we very quickly got upgraded to a two bedroom suite which was extremely impressive. Loads of space. The first day our room got cLeaned the cleaners accidentally threw away my sons baby of baby food, formula and all his supplies. They say it was mistaken for garbage. After a mad dash to Target only a few minutes away is able to replace everything. They gave us a discount on our room. Don't know if I'd stay again as it was still a drive to/from disnleyland which was the main purpose of the holiday. It was close to shopping dining and groceries. If your going for baseball the field is across the road. People complained of trains but we were on the first floor facing the tracks and it didn't bother us one bit.Thank you for choosing the TownePlace Suites Anaheim for your stay. We are delighted to hear the kitchen in the guest room supplied everything you needed and found the complimentary morning breakfast impressive. Additionally, we are very truly sorry that your son's supplies were thrown away by accident. This issue will definitely be addressed in order to prevent this from happening again in the future, please accept our apologies. In addition, the hotel does offer an Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) shuttle stop right outside the front of the hotel and travels to Disneyland for a small fee it usually makes stops every hour daily during Disneys operating hours. The ART tickets can be purchased at our front desk daily and they are good for all day, so you can go back and forth as many times as you wish. We apologize if this was not offered to you upon check-in. Again, thank you for your review of the hotel as these reviews assist us in continuously looking at ways to enhance the stays of all our current and future guests."
"6117",5,"The entire staff at the Days Inn made us feel welcomed and at home during our recent trip to the area for my son's college regional playoffs!"
"6118",5,"This hotel is clean, cozy and cheap. It is a small hotel in a small city. Everything was in good working order and my bed was comfortable. The staff is very friendly and I received my key in less than 2 minutes ! Great after a long, long flight. I recommend."
"6119",5,"The hotel is in a great location, right on main street and walkable to a lot of shops, restaurants, etc. The hotel was nice, clean, comfortable. The staff was helpful, friendly and professional. To wake up and look at the red rocks (Snoopy Lucy) and others from our room was an extra treat."
"6120",3,"Bad: Our bathroom wasn't cleaned all that well. The kitchen had sticky spots. The walk to everything was kind of far for my family. Good: Friendly staff. Nice area near the lobby to sit."

There's a hampton inn down the road that is just as 'nice', would rate as average, and provides a breakfast with the rate. I guess if you're getting reimbursed for expenses, then your rating would be higher.I am sorry to hear your stay with us did not quite meet your expectations. However, we do appreciate your feedback and thank you for sharing your experience on Trip Advisor.Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor"
"6132",2,"break fast is an apology of a breakfast..Even ordinary hotels in third world serve better breakfast.."
"6133",5,"Had a fantastic stay at the Troubadour. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants. The hotel was clean and modern. The only negative was that the walls are very thin but didn't bother us too much. Everything else well surpassed my expectations. Thank you very much for the five star review!!! We love to hear that we exceeded just about all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests. Please know that our walls were actually built thicker than what was recommended for a hotel when we completed this renovation, may have been a case of noisy neighbors that we could always try to assist with once reported.We appreciate you staying with us and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"

"6139",3,"Great location, views, ammenities but hotel was not clean, older hotel, room small, elevator slow, staff not that friendly, tv didnt work till we got it fixed, AC did not work well."
"6140",4,"Stayed there to be close to downtown disney"
"6141",4,"We stopped at flagstaff for a point that was close to the Canyon and more affordable. The rooms were nice and clean. Very affordable and in good location near lots of places to eat. There was free wifii and access to computer and printer. Staff was friendly especially Chelsea Grissom. Continental breakfast was OK."
"6142",5,"room layout is very ideal as kids slept on pullout and we had separated king bed. tv swivels both ways!"
"6143",5,"This is a very clean hotel. The staff is always very friendly and extremely helpful! The breakfast is worth every penny and I would recommend trying the French toast. I stay here at least every six months and I am always very pleased with every aspect of my stay!"
"6144",5,"Was traveling. Had been driving all day. Went to this Hotel, was so very pleased. The staff at front desk was professional yet friendly. The rooms were clean and bright. The bathrooms were spotless. (im sort of picky) Complimentary coffee in Lobby. Fresh Cookie upon arrival. Comfortable beds, nice pillows. Will stay again."
"6145",3,"On Monday while watching a news program, the light went off. I waited 10mins nothing happened and I called the front desk and I was told something like: light went out in the entire New Carrollton area. That was not their fault but not to have adequate preparation and provision in case of such occurrence is unacceptable. I was unaware when the back up power came up because my room never had light until the New Carrollton light came back. Business should be business. I paid for a full service, not spending some moment in darkness. Thank you."
"6146",4,"Bad: There was no complimentary bottle of water. If you need water, you need to buy from the mini bar. For the breakfast, wish there were more hot food. Good: Liked the fact there was breakfast on every floor and enjoyed the drinks in the evening."
"6147",5,"I had a great stay. Staff was very friendly and welcoming."
"6148",5,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It is in an excellent location - waterfront- right near the downtown Dunedin action. I would recommend staying here. The hotel has a bar and restaurant, waterfront view, great parking, great views"
"6149",1,"No cable, no hot water. Reported to staff/manager He said all of Albert Lea didn't have cable, and hot water always works...you just need to pull really hard on the faucet (which I did). No apologies, just stated we already offer the lowest price rate, and I can't do anything about it I thought I would take a chance since I was there for 1 night after reading reviews. My advice DON'T DO IT!! After a long hard day of work, a hot shower and cable is not expecting too much."
"6150",4,"If it would have just been an overnight stay no elevator would have been ok., However, when you have more than 1 bag and companion not able to walk very well it would have been convenient to have an elevator."
"6151",4,"This hotel accommodated multiple family reunions very well. You can't beat the location. It's directly across from the mall, walking distance to several restaurants and minutes drive to others. Yet, you don't have to leave if you don't want to. There's a heavy manager's reception each evening with complimentary adult beverages and a buffet meal: pasta, hotdogs, meatballs, baked potatoes,... More"
"6152",5,"Very satisfied with my stay and very affordable! The breakfast in the morning was great as well. It was a very easy process to check out in the morning. The employees that I walked past in the hallways were very friendly. Overall it was a very pleasant stay!"
"6153",5,"My family of six wanted a hotel that would be comfortable but did not offer many amenities that would up the price because we did not plan to be in the hotel except to sleep. I found this hotel very comfortable and clean and would recommend it for a family on a weekend stay (as it is located in a technology park and might be busier during the week). It was relatively inexpensive and close to both Baltimore and DC."
"6154",5,"Das Mill's House Hotel ist fr mich ein typisches durchschnittliches Stadthotel. Das Zimmer war eher klein aber mit guten Betten. Die Einrichtung war hbsch, ausreichend und sauber. Da das Zimmer zum Innenhof lag war es sehr ruhig; der Pool war geschlossen, obwohl es zum Baden noch warm genug gewesen wre.Das Restaurant hatte die Grsse einer Bahnhofshalle und hat uns nicht zum Bleiben 'verfhrt'. Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger. Ich wrde vermutlich eher in Savannah ein Hotel suchen und lnger bleiben, und Charleston nur im Vorbeifahren besichtigen."
"6155",2,"When there is a Colts game, parking commitments to guests are abandoned in favor of game day parking. The debacle caused us to miss a planned event. Had to check out early because the valets could not promise to bring my car on time, even though I gave them an hour's notice. 25 daily parking fee should ensure better service."
"6156",5,"Had a blast at Arizona Mountain Inn. Cabins are really neat, fully equipped, and the staff goes above and beyond expectations to make you feel comfortable. If you're looking for that log-cabin experience, this is the place for you. Winter skiing, hiking, fishing, hunting, golfing.... all nearby. Super vacation!"
"6157",5,"I was concerned about the location, because of the reviews, but it is a nice area. Far, of course, from the points of interest, but if you want to stay right next to rhe White House you have to pay the price. Very eficient staff, very clean room. I just hated the restaurant. The waitress was very slow, the food was not so bad, but when it finally got to our table it was already cold. I would rather go to McDonald's."
"6158",5,"Hotel was clean, staff was friendly! Would definitely stay here again. We were traveling with three kids, and the pool was nice to play in and the hot tub was nice to relax in.

"6160",4,"The hotel is clean and fairly new on the inside. Comfortable rooms. Bathrooms are small but full tub and good shower. Not a luxury place but pleasant. Fabulous location and views of the Falls fireworks from some rooms. Staff was very helpful. Dog friendly!"
"6161",5,"Special thank you to Casey Martin, Chaunee, Antonio, Lee, and everyone else who made our stay so great! Casey was especially awesome helping us plan events at the hotel and personally catering to every need we had while there!"
"6162",2,"This place is old and dated. The bed was really uncomfortable. They put a thick pad on top of the mattress I guess to make it better. Instead it just gets wadded up when you sleep. The coverlet on to of the bed was worn and pilled and you don't even want to sit on it. The room had an odd smell. The breakfast buffet was pitiful. I'm so glad we only had to spend one night here."
"6163",2,"Our stay was mediocre at best! There is CHELSEA and Chelsea ANNEX. We had the ANNEX, and it was in poor condition. Furniture was far from nice, front desk and lobby gave you a very good first impression. The people at the desk were nice. One block from the beach, which was huge for me. Paid parking at 10 a day in a lot about 1.5 blocks away, or, 15 a day got valet. The elevator was very rough to ride. There was a small, but nice, pool. No coffee maker, no microwave, no mini-frig, ices machine did not work very well. Out air conditioning was set at 50* and it was so hot in there, especially for sleeping. The maintenance man said it couldn't get any cooler because it ran on cold water, and the water wasn't cold! If you are in AC to gamble, or go to the beach, this is fine to use the beaten down bathroom, or lay your head on a pillow. We won't be guests here again!"
"6164",3,"Bad: No business center..wifi wasnt free..it asked for ten bucks...the internet kiosk was 650 for 30 mins..but deducted 20 mins to print boarding passes and no shuttle to airport. Good: Location"
"6165",5,"I had a room on the 9th floor. Supposed to be a small room but in reality was very adequate with a king size bed. Comfortable, and total paid on booking.com was 88! I was walking distance to the Southshore train which I used to travel from Michigan City, Indiana. I arrived early, 10:45am, and I had planned to ask them to just hold my overnight bag, but they said my room was ready so I was checked in by 11 am! Wow! Every staff member was very helpful, and I enjoyed dinner at the Elephant and Castle restaurant affiliated with the hotel. Excellent food and beverage."

"6175",5,"Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!"

This was a 10,000 Marriott points hotel -- and we have stayed in 20,000 point places that were less than satisfying."
"6183",4,"Overall, our stay was enjoyable. Right away, we did notice the remote didn't work, so I asked the front desk for some new batteries. They provided them, but the remote still wouldn't turn the TV on. Finally, after tapping the remote on the table, it started working. The room condition was good, and the beds were comfortable. Something that seemed unsanitary, however, was at breakfast, we found a hair on a spoon for the eggs. We showed one of the people behind the counter, but all she did was take the hair off the spoon. That was an uncomfortable situation."

Room was clean and everything worked as it should. Reasonable rates for the area. I wish Best Western would improve their online registration process."

"6198",5,"We booked Nopsi for my 40th birthday and this hotel lived up to my expectations. My spouse is a lifetime Marriott Platinum member so we have had our fair share of hotel stays. The service and hospitality was amazing. The staff was courteous without feeling stuffy...the best way to describe them was authentic with a large does of Southern hospitality and they were all wonderful.They upgraded us to a better room which comprised of a wrap around view. The upgrade was complimentary even though they were fully booked. Two thumbs up and what a wonderful way to kick-off my birthday.The hotel bed is amazing. I described it as feeling hugged but not hot. I received the best sleep and my spouse said the same. I'm a side sleeper and he's a back sleeper so it's shocking that we both like the mattress.The bed was so comfortable that I emailed the hotel to get the make of the mattress and will order it for our own home.We frequented the lobby bar and the drinks were on point.I don't recall the name of my drink but it reminded me of salty plum but our bartender described it as vinegary. Personally, I thought it was well-balanced. The Frenchman was also well-made here. The rooftop bar was a scene but not compared to Orange County or LA. Much less pretentious and the skyline was pleasant.As others have mentioned, the hotel is not in the middle of the action but walking distance to Bourbon St and many of the best local restaurants (GW Fins being my fav for the grilled oysters and desserts).Bottom line, I would stay here again the next time we are in NOLA.Sara, thank you so much for choosing to stay at NOPSI! Its wonderful to learn that you had such a fun and memorable 40th birthday with us. We love making all occasions special, and were delighted to have won you over. A terrace room overlooking the city certainly provides an unforgettable experience. We hope you and your husband will make visiting us an annual birthday tradition so that we may treat you to more pleasant surprises!Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"6199",3,"Was probably once a great place. Needs an overhaul. The rooms are large, but poorly air conditioned. The pool is indoor/outdoor, which is pretty neat. The spa tub is old and needs to be updated. There is plenty of truck parking for 18 wheelers."

We asked for direction and way of getting around and they were very disinterested in helping us (there were 9 of us). When we went down to the continental breakfast we were asked where our coupon for brekfast was we asked if our room key would do she said no. We went down to the front desk got the coupon went back up and she said okay you have it but NEVER even looked at it we could have shown her a fake card she would have never have known she jsut made it inconfience for us to eat. Beware that if they say you can walk somewhere that it will only take you 20 minutes plann for 45 to hour they have no sense of time or distance."
"6209",3,"Problems with room , brand new Hotel paint peeling, tile broken in shower, room flooded."
"6210",2,"I was only there overnight, stayed on first floor. Room was small but adequate. Wallpaper falling off the wall in bathroom. When AC was turned on there was an awful musty, moldy odor. Had to turn it off due to my allergies. The next morning I found a HUGE spider in the bathtub. I don't do well with these things but managed to somehow drown it in the semi hot water the hotel offered. Have to say that that traumatized me a little. Hate spiders, especially big ones. I managed to take a shower after that, always looking around me for more. After I dressed I decided to make a cup of coffee in the room's keurig, poured the creamer that is supplied into the cup. It immediately curdled! When checking the expiration date on the creamer it read 8/11/15 and my stay was on 9/5/15. After that I just packed up and checked out. Receptionist at desk was nice but didn't offer discount for the problems I encountered. Only good thing I can say is the pillows were comfy. Checking this dump off my list."

"6213",5,"I am always pleased with my time at a Hampton Inn. I stay for business but would recommend the Hampton Inns for anyone traveling for any reason. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff is extremely caring and friendly. Locations are good and I find that Hampton Inns are consistent with their service and quality wherever they are."
"6214",3,"Booked for a convention over a Friday thru Saturday recently, It was prudent to reserve my stay on the premises, although my customer loyalty cards recommended the hotel across from the golf course. Prices were not as low as many reviewers state for this hotel, two weeks prior the event but relatively expensive Friday and Saturday night stays (almost double the workweek day rate - and almost all hotels do this in Las Vegas, some more than others). Flights expensive from the East Coast this year, Saturday return some 100 cheaper than flying back on Sunday - and the red eye flights leave close to the date changeover time.The next shock came finding out about getting there from and to McCarran Intl. airport - it's apprx. 17 miles in distance, taxicab 60...70 when arriving late night! But what the hotel staff did not readily disclose - ther's a low-key bus (WestCliff Express) for two (2) dollars, that takes about 50 minutes (while still running along the highways) and makes its final scheduled stop less than a quarter mile/400m from the hotel entrance! Other participants of the convention took out rental cars (the hotel shuttle, price not known, last leaves hotel or airport by 6pm, so you're out of luck on eastbound red eye flights, that's where the bus really pulls its weight...)Enormous lobby areas greet you and hefty puffs of cigarette smoke - almost like good ole Europe (used to be...). The area appears more cluttered (efficiently equipped) with money machines than in some other hotels on and off the strip, making it a challenge to find your orientation and the concierge area, at first.Yes, the personnel really is friendlier here than in town, instead of the allocated room on the third floor, I requested one on a higher level and was granted one with an outstanding view of the golf course and the mountains. Clean room, with separate sink area vs shower/toilet area, albeit fixtures telling their heritage closer to the 80s than the 2000s. A flat screen TV (not HD)with a very limited program but a few music channels that are worth mentioning (and I couldn't turn it off at the end of a two night stay, not via remote or on the mainframe!) The biggest drawback were the enormous 4 AC motors below (the size of B757 engines) and their significant noise when at least two of the four fans were continuously running - mind, we had 107F (40C) outside temps during the day...Too bad, despite the weekend room rate surcharge, wi-fi was available only at another surcharge of 12,99/day, and amazingly, I managed without. No group discount (considering the conference) had been negotiated.A very opulent breakfast bar greets the all-nighter not before 8am on weekends, keep your gambling registration card handy as it will give you 2 meal discount, but prices are really reasonable for Las Vegas, the quantity or the quality. Likewise the prime rib dinner buffet, good job, guys! Please tip the friendly staff like Easterners...A solid good, not quite very good and I decisively wish to criticize the very draughty, excessively chilled conference rooms on the second floor (near the bingo hal) with no possibility of adjusting climate control clearly spells out that this hotel isn't latest generation any more.Would I recommend it heat-soaked LA drivers might find their sanctuary here, it's not close to the strip, but if you don't need access to downtown daily and are a little more cost conscious, this might just be your choice for a few days. Good luck in winning a jackpot!"

"6225",5,"We drove up to Sedona in the wee hours of the night. Awoke to the beautiful scenery! This hotel is clean and well taken care of. The continental breakfast isn't mind blowing but has the basics. For the price and convenience, it can't be beat."

"6231",4,"Good access form 95, but quiet. Clean comfortable room and good value with a coupon rate. Steps away from Ruby Tuesdays where you can order take out meals on-line form your room. Good breakfast selection and coffee to get you going in the morning."
"6232",3,"Overall our stay was ok, Staff was not helpful when checking in. One attendant said she will help you in a minute after she gets off phone. Then after she was off and I stood there for few minutes she said can i help you. I said we are checking in, She said that the other attendant will help me!! Finally checked in, Room was ok, Nothing spectacular although the mirror was so clean my wife thought there was another room. lol Biggest downfall was that there seemed to be a lot of coming and going late at night/early morning. Hotel is right behind a questionable restaraunt. We did not have any issues though, just a feeling of concern,"
"6233",4,"Actually in room didn't work,and the pool is very small other then that stay was good."
"6234",2,"I have had to stay here quite a few times over the past few years. Staff nice, room clean, nice beds,etc,etc. BUT. Terrible acoustics mean you hear everything. And as they have wedding parties every weekend you have to suffer noise and disruption from wedding guests staying in the hotel. Up until 5am at times. No sleep for me. Smoking and drinking outside the front lobby, and no one to stop them until I phoned at 2am to complain. Where is the noise coming from , I was asked Right in front of you , I said. They need to MANAGE this. Not put non wedding guests on floors with guests, and they should put polite notices up about noise. During the week fine - but avoid the weekend unless you like being kept up all night."
"6235",5,"Free breakfast is an added perk however the same food 3 days in a row i couldn't face cheese omelets and sausage for the 3rd day so i ate out. a little variety here would be nice. also check out is 11 am. housekeeping was knocking on my door at 8:30. i felt like i was being rushed out. room was super clean and spacious. the location of the hotel is excellent."
"6236",4,"The sink, beneath the faucet was not clean. Not sure what that was. The rest of the building was very clean. Bed was uncomfortably soft. Proximity to the plaza was excellent. The staff was tremendous."

We don't gamble and really didn't care for being required to have to walk through the smoke filled casino, or even just the casino to get to our room.It seems that your experience was not up to our high standards, and I sincerely apologize for that! We strive for five-star experiences with every guest every time. If you have feedback on how we can improve, please reach out. Otherwise, we hope youll visit again to give us another chance to wow you!"

"6247",5,"We stayed here for a night and absolutely loved it. The hotel staff were courteous, helpful, and very personable. The only thing we could suggest is that they could have something other than water for their guests to drink. Other than that (and that wasn't really a big deal at all), everything was splendid."

"6256",2,"The temperature in the room was inconsistent. It was either to hot or to cold. The unit did not maintain the temperature I selected which was really uncomfortable at night while trying to sleep. The fabric shower curtain was dirty. It had stains and what appeared to be dried up shampoo with hair."
"6257",5,"We stayed in one of their penthouses which had a beautiful private balcony. A nice bedroom, kitchen, and lovely living room. Every evening they have wine and cheese, followed by warm cookies. In the morning they have a lovely continental breakfast in the morning. Several blocks to the beach. Great Location. We stayed 5 days and could have stayed more!"
"6258",3,"We were satisfied with our accommodations but were surprised by a 9 parking fee. We were not aware of the fee before hand and this should be disclosed when booking the hotel."
"6259",2,"First off there is no parking, valet is your only option which would be fine if it were a better hotel. Our AC didn't work, maintenance had to come reset it three times. Very inconvenient at 8pm, 11pm then again at 1am. The pool is a joke, it's more like a bathtub. And the amazing breakfast they advertise is no better than a Continental at most hotels. Over all it was a huge disappointment."
"6260",4,"Bad: Rooms not ready when they said they were. Walls too thin and so it was noisy,. Could not get hot water in shower and the elevator broke. Also no corkscrew or cheese cutter which should be included. Good: The units were modern and well cared for. The price was good for the location. The layout of the unit was good. The staff was pleasant and I am sure would help if needed."
"6261",5,"This hotel is very nice. Comfortable bed, lots of room, great Breakfast. The only cheesy thing was their evening snack at happy hour. It was potato chips and cheese with a variety of dry snacks. They may as well have put out pretzels and nuts and called it a day. I expected more."
"6262",1,"I would love to write a great reveiw to this Hotel, just like the majority of the other people here.However......I did not actually get to stay here. A booking was made by telephone for a 2 bed suite for New years Eve. We arrived ready to check in. Unfortunately the desk clerk was totally unhelpful. Our reservation was non existant. The clerk did not give a damn. We had travelled only a relatively short time (150 miles), but now were without accomodation on New Year. The clerk would not even help with finding an alternative. The reservation had been checked TWICE before arriving, The first time was 2 days prior, and then the night before arriving. The number we were given WAS confirmed both times on the phone, so we travelled to Anaheim without any worries. HOW WRONG WE WERE! The Reservation number that was confirmed twice has now upon arrival turned into a non existant number. There was no record of the whole transaction. After trying unsucsessfully to get any help whatsoever from the staff, we decided to give up and find an alternative. As can be expected the area was booked up, except for one place - a real roach motel. We chose to stay there (another bad choice) and had the worse night sleep ever . Thanks to Marriot the 2009 celebrations were ruined! What more can I say except - CHECK CHECK and double check, even after you receive a conformation number. Get it in writing!It looks like they had double booked and tried to fob us off . Hope this reveiw is helpful to everyone."
"6263",2,"Los colchones no son comodos, solo trabajo un elevador, las toallas curtidas, el aire acondicionado no se pudo regular la temperatura."
"6264",2,"I will never stay here again and its a shame because the facility and location were very nice. I booked and paid in full via Hotels.com. When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay. After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay. On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance. I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in. After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning. The rooms were nice and location was fantastic but its a shame the desk staff doesn't have a clue, I will not be returning to this chain and also will push my friends and family to avoid it as well."

"6268",4,"Stayed two nights. Very noisy next door till after 11 each night. Ask if I could be moved. Was told when reported the next morning after the first night, that I should have called the Front Desk. Told her I did not wish to make anyone angry. I was by myself I am over 70. Breakfast was great. The hotel's shuttle was very accommodating."
"6269",4,"Good experience with one exception. Room 123 is not good due to close proximity to exercise room, and should perhaps be considered as not a guest room. Each morning as people would exercise, perhaps at 5am, I awoke and could not return to sleep because the running on the machine was very loud."
"6270",5,"The staff and amenities are excellent!!"
"6271",5,"The rooms were brand new with huge balconies. A glass wall opened to the balcony so that the room was fully open to the outside. The staff was extremely friendly and courteous and the hotel was in a great location. Each unit had a full kitchen and the pool area was what you expect from a much more expensive resort.... More"
"6272",5,"We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!"
"6273",5,"We skiied at nearby Cascade Mountain and stayed at this inn. The breakfast included waffles, hard boiled eggs, muffins, bagels, cereal, apples and plenty of good coffee. The beds were fine with extra pillows, the room had a flat screen TV and was quiet. The pool was medium size and the hot tub was fine. Good hotel."
"6274",5,"If you're in Edison for whatever reason, this is the first, last and only hotel to consider staying at. Free parking, free wifi, free shuttle, free treats in the lobby, and friendly staff, I have NO negative complaints about this hotel. I loved my stay here!"
"6275",4,"We received two free weekend nights from Suncoast. Our room was spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable. Whenever we saw an employee they greeted us and were willing to assist! We had to book an extra night and it was very reasonable. I experienced Pure Spa which is on site. WOW! They offered a great combo spa treatment which was to die for! The buffet resturant was also better then expected. Usually buffets are pretty boring but theirs was actually pretty good!"
"6276",2,"The public areas of this property are relatively well maintained, and the staff there are friendly and efficient. Oddities: 1. The layout of the room--The beds were very close to the door, so it was impossible to ignore the noise in the hallway that went on all night. 2. Housekeepers expected to clean the room while we were in it. 3. Hotel staff knocked on the door at 10pm, and insisted on entering the room to exchange a new phone book for the old one in the room, even though we told them the children were sleeping. Very strange."
"6277",5,"This hotel was very nice - I had read some of the reviews previously - and was a bit leery to stay here - boy was I wrong! Check in was a slow process - there were a about four people ahead of us, however the line moved quickly. We asked for King upgrade - if they had any and... More"

Definitely the best choice, last year I went to Colorado and we stayed in Denver at Hyatt hotel, the hotel was good but at Hyatt they charge for parking, breakfast and wifi, and at the Holiday Inn Express this all free. I will pickup the Holiday Inn Express again for future vacations."
"6299",3,"We stay at this property at least once a year when we head to Vegas to visit family. We like the location, off the strip in more of the residential area. The rooms have recently been renovated with an updated dcor. The rooms are very spacious and we have never had a problem with noise. The pool never seems crowded. The food is average. Sunrise breakfast for 3.99 in the caf, but you have to know about it as it is not on the menu. We are members of their BConnected players program and do receive the occasional perk, however be aware that anything you win ie. breakfast buffets, have to be used the following day. Other casinos vouchers are good for a longer period of time. Years ago I used to win money or break even, not so for the past few years. We had an issue with our bill at check-out, as we do every year. Someone had visited a bar and charged it to our room. The front desk gal said she'd look into it and within an hour was corrected. My only negative comment is how unwilling they are to satisfy a customer issue. Tried to use buffet coupons one day after expiration. We were told to go to the players club and see about getting comps...were told NO. We had a 15.00 food credit on the room which apparently was only good for that particular date (we used it the day before) and upon check-out was charged to the room. I explained that we were not told it could only be used for that particular date as our stay was for more that one day. NO credit. Very poor customer service considering the size of Boyd properties. Pretty sure 15.00 isn't going to break them and I don't like feeling cheated. This will definitely be a deciding factor for our next trip. Plenty of places to choose from when visiting Las Vegas. Suncoast isn't the only game in town!"
"6300",5,"Good: Best breakfast I ever had!!!"

"6307",4,"The room looked like it was recently redone, it and the lobby were very attractive. But be aware that the closet rod (really a cabinet) was one foot long and there was not a single drawer for clothes. This would be a nice, reasonably priced room for one night. Shuttle service was great, breakfast hot but unremarkable."
"6308",1,"Following a fourteen hour drive, we arrived, very tired, to check in at 3 AM on April 17th. I booked a non-smoking room but there was only a smoking room available. We were given the keys to room 410. This is an outside room in the back of the hotel that abuts a truck stop.  I used the bathroom which had water all over the floor, and went back into the main room. The room had stained carpets, lights that didnt work and things just didnt seem particularly clean. However, the bed was nicely made and we were very tired. I pulled back the bed spread to find rumpled sheets covered in blood. I chose to contact Expedia, whose representative contacted the front desk and arranged for a refund of all three reservations booked with this hotel. At my request Expedia also arranged for us to stay at a different hotel in the area. I do not believe that it takes much intelligence to connect the dots and determine what happened here.When we were back in town on Friday we stopped back to the hotel in an attempt to speak with the manager. We were told that he was not in.  I left a message asking that he call me, to which there has been no response. Even though this is a two star hotel, these conditions are disgusting."
"6309",5,"We were thrilled to find availability at this hotel, as we booked it the week before our trip. Most hotels were sold out in the area, so we were pleasantly surprised to find comfortable, clean, and hospitable accommodations. We loved the location, which was within a couple miles of Old Town San Diego. If we ever need to return, I... More"

"6313",4,"We stayed at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown for two nights. It is a convenient hotel with studio style rooms. It is well located right in front of the famous Space Needle. You have to walk about 15 minutes to Pike Place and the Centre but that is still very convenient. Breakfast was included, but we did not make use of it. They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay. Only thing: the elevators are ridiculously slow we stood down waiting for one car to arrive what felt like ages. And we are happy to spend our last night there as well on our way back home."
"6314",5,"From the moment we arrived at the Benson the staff was helpful and accommodating. They had our suitcases inside before my husband had even paid for our taxi. From giving us suggestions on transportation to dining, they were always friendly and with great information. They are currently doing renovations, but knowing that we were going to be there for a...

"6316",1,"Two positives: the front desk staff and the lobby. ALL downhill from there. Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER. I will never stay here again--for the same money you can stay at the EconoLodge next door--certainly no better, but how could it be worse"
"6317",5,"I visit this hotel a few times a year and I'm always satisfied with the rooms.

"6322",4,"If you are looking for a hotel with a cool Miami-style vibe in a central location, this might be the place for you. The hotel is located right on the main drag (Duval street) so it's close to restaurants, drugstores, bars, etc. You can walk to everything from the hotel. The downside to the location is that it is close to Duval. We were in a room that was close enough to Duval that you could hear partying way into the night. After having difficulty sleeping the first night (noise until about 3 am) we asked to moved the next morning, the person at the front desk entertained the idea but was not able to come through. An apology or at least some empathy would have been nice (for example, Oh, I'm sorry the noise kept you up). That was not the case. The response was, At least you're not in rooms xxx and xxx because those are right on Duval. Not what I expected from a place like this and also because we are platinum members of the hotel chain. The pool area is small but lovely with its zen motif and trees in the background. The rooms were also pretty hip and the toiletries very nice. The hotel staff was fine...cordial..but not friendly or terribly accommodating. The free breakfast perk for platinum members was a parfait (fine but not up to par with other hotels in the brand). I might have taken the points and paid for the breakfast instead. At the least they should give you a credit to apply to something else. The bikes on the property were GREAT! We also enjoyed outstanding drinks at the stylish hotel bar. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would probably choose the hotel again the next time we are in the keys. Thank you for taking the time to write a detailed review of your stay with us. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay aside from some of the issues that you mentioned. We are disappointed to hear about some of the issues you had and we will be sure to address them. We do hope you will return and allow us the opportunity to provide you with a perfect stay."

"6325",5,"This hotel was absolutely wonderful. I was a little leary at first but I was happily surprised when I walked into the lobby. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful....except for the concierge the evening we arrived. He was super annoying and kept bugging us to talk to him for ideas of things to do. Our room was spacious and clean. Our room was broken into two areas...a bedroom and a living room, both of which had tvs. We were extremely pleased with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel."

"6331",3,"Overall great stay, rooms are small but cozy ... great fire place near bar to sit and drink wine. Staff was good except this one lady (I may go to extent of calling her border line racist), the reason: we were travelling to Lake Tahoe and asked hotel staff that can we leave our extra luggage at our check out and pick it up once we are back, we were told yes we can but on the day we were leaving she told us they will not, we told her that you guys said you can ... so what has changed to that she did not have any answer. It was a very bad experience and significantly delayed our travel to Lake Tahoe while trying to figure out what to do with extra luggage."

"6339",5,"Since I rarely have or take the time to reply to emails asking me to rate a particular hotel, item or service me seeking out your website to make my comments is telling in itself. My wife and I stayed in the Pentagon City location from 7/4/2013 to 7/7/2013. It was, in our opinion, the best hotel stay for us, ever. Every single member of the staff that we encountered from the moment that we pulled our vehicle into the check in area on 7/4 until our trunk was packed on 7/7 was friendly, professional and helpful. It was our pleasure to enjoy dinner in your restaurant on 7/4 and breakfast the remaining three days. Each meal was excellent. I would specifically like to mention Bryan Haley who took the time on the evening of 7/4 to chat with us at our dinner table. What is amazing to me is that Bryan and most of the other staff seemed to remember us and all of the other guests. Please thank your staff for a memorable stay.

"6347",4,"I have stayed in this area a few times and think it is among the best if you are approaching D.C. from the south by car. There is a nice shuttle to the nearby Metro and mall area so you can stay parked for your stay. If you have to drive, it is closer to D.C. and Arlington then it looks on the map. The rooms are a bit small but reasonably comfortable. Breakfast is a notch above the usual fare. Best of all, price is affordable for families or for the business traveler."

When arriving after driving for hours we were told there was no restroom to use and then trying to get into our room with no success, we ended up going to a restaurant next door. We will never go to the Super 8 in Crawfordsville again.

"6385",3,"Bad: We had booked 2 rooms for our 3 night Boston trip - King Room for us and a Double Double (ie with 2 double beds) for our teenagers. I booked this in December for our July visit. I emailed twice before arrival to request that the rooms were close by (on the same floor) and both times got no reply - and that should have alerted me and to be honest sums up 'Boxer Customer Service'. On arrival we were told that there were no rooms available with 2 beds, the guy on reception seemed clueless how to help us. Our teenagers were supposedly 'upgraded' to a suite where my son had to sleep on a sofa / pull out bed (or share a King size bed with his sister). Totally unacceptable - I booked these rooms 6 months in advance. All in all we had interactions with 4 different staff members (including someone from Accounts who had to process a compensation refund) and at no time did either my wife nor I feel like the Customer . . . . you know the kind The PAYING Customer! So in terms of Comfort score - low because my son was on a sofa bed for 3 nights. In terms of Value for Money - low 1800 and my 16 year old son gets a sofa bed In terms of Staff score - low because they are in serious need of some Customer Service training. Good: The Boxer in Boston SHOULD be a fantastic hotel - it's a great building, location is excellent (we were able to explore everything that Boston has to offer from there), rooms are a good size but overall our stay was not as good as it should have been.

On the bright side: got an upgrade and a very nice room, late checkout, the concierges are knowledgeable and get you in difficult places like the Polo Bar across the street.downsides: the Ducasse restaurant is gone and hasn't been replaced so you're left with a somewhat lame breakfast/diner lounge. The King Cole must be run trotskyists since i was refused entry before midnight despite identifying myself as an hotel guest. I duly complained and next day was served a deliberate over spicy bloody mary in what felt like retaliation. The hotel as a butler service that packs your stuff on demand. I lost i cherished Lanvin fedora on the process without so much of an excuse. Considering the price you pay you can find better options in NY.

The fitness room was well-maintained and the hotel overall pleasing. The casino was well-ventilated and equipped with all the standard gaming.The breakfast buffet was a bargain for we mature folks. The evening buffet was mediocre at best.The desk was verrrry slow in checking in.The biggest disadvantage of the Suncoast is its location out away from the Strip and downtown. It is isolated in a more residential part of northwest Las Vegas. They do try to compensate by making a free shuttle available which ran on time and took guests to the airport or to the Strip."

It had two double beds. There was a desk, microwave, and a little fridge. I had difficulty in getting captions but the front desk clerk help me out. Housekeeping... More"
"6400",5,"Everything was wonderful, down to the sign, the balloons and chocolate bar in the room for the 2 birthdays we were celebrating. Great view of the Chincoteague channel, room was clean, staff was very courteous, breakfast buffet was extremely scrumptious. Overall very excellent stay in the middle of November!!"
"6401",5,"I'm so impressed. I got in late last night, and needed a cab early in the morning, and needed on time. The person I spoke with at the desk confirmed they'd have it there when needed (and I'm sure she meant to, she was very helpful). Well, staff changed overnight and the message didn't get passed on, and even if it had, apparently they're not supposed to do that, I should have called in the morning. When the car wasn't there, I was frustrated. The person I spoke with was very apologetic and tried to help, but when I realized what happened I just immediately booked an uber, and left very disappointed. Things like this are mistakes, no hotel (or person for that matter) is above an occasional mistake, but how it's handled makes all the difference. Tonight I got a personal email from their operations manager apologizing again, which was totally unexpected, and very appreciated. As if that wasn't enough, he also credited me a bunch of Marriott Rewards points in an effort to go the extra mile. Wow. I was amazed! I've had bigger things than this happen, and have just been told basically tough luck. They didn't have to do anything and they did. You could see a small hotel really caring about my experience, but generally I wouldn't expect it from a large chain (or the LARGEST in the world for that matter). My trust is higher now than it was before I checked in. Thank you. Definitely Redeemed. Other than that, normal courtyard, great."
"6402",4,"We are having work done in our home and needed somewhere comfortable to stay that wasn't too far for my husband to commute to work and so I could get my daughter to school on time. Glad we chose the Raddison. It was comfortable and convenient."
"6403",4,"We spent the weekend here last week for a college visit and apart from having a floor full of teenagers visiting the hotel, we had a very good experience staying here.

"6406",4,"Bad: There were a couple younger staff at the desk during mid day times that seemed bothered by questions. Good: Easy to park. The room was clean and cool. Valet staff was really nice. Steve the maintence man was amazing. I dropped my pearl earring down the bathroom sink. He took the time to take the loop of the drain and get my pearl earring back. I was grateful for his extra service and care."
"6407",5,"The property was beautiful. It was a perfect getaway spot for a busy couple looking to unplug. Highly recommend the cottage with the outdoor tub and shower - it was wonderful. The restaurants on the property were also great."
"6408",2,"Bad: I really do not know how this hotel has an 8.3 rating. Room is not like the pictures. Very noisy cleanning staff. Parking is not included as the listing says. You have to pay additional fees at the hotel. Definetely, not going back. Good: The receptionist was friendly. You can get some coffe in the back."
"6409",4,"This was a very good hotel for our family. The management kept us together on the same floor and was very resposive to any needs we had. The continental breakfast was very acceptable. The business center was very easy to access while we were there. It is well located as to access to the interstates and has many good resturants close by. The Metro is close and very easy to access. I would have no qualms using this again the next time we are in the area."

"6413",5,"I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. From the time I arrived the customer service I received has been nothing less of truly amazing. All the way from the staff that checked me in to the staff at the bar during happy hour. The shuttles are great if you dont have a car they will take you to/from the airport, to/from the mall and anywhere requested within a mile radius of the airport. The room its self can use a bathroom update but overall not too bad. The breakfast was great with cooked to order omelets. This hotel was worth every penny."
"6414",5,"We spent 6 days at this lovely resort and everything about it was terrific. We were upgraded to a suite at the far western part of this sprawling resort and had a lovely view of the ocean.

"6416",3,"I just got back from my 4 night stay here at the SunCoast hotel. I have to say that rooms are spacious, nice and very clean. Valet staff was also nice and was understanding when I forgot a couple items and the gentlemen who helped us carry our bags was very kind and welcoming as well. On the other hand, costumer service is very bad.Front desk staff is horrible. At some point, there was three families in line and all three of the front desk agents were looking at their computer screens completely ignoring that they had guests waiting to check in and check out for about 5 minutes (didn't even look up once). One afternoon I tried to order room service at around 2:40 and to my surprise the lady on the phone advised me that there wasn't anyone to take my order at the moment. So If i wanted to eat I had to go downstairs to the restaurant. At the restaurant, the staff was welcoming. They seated us quickly. But their attention to detail was missing. I had asked for a drink with ice and they would forget the ice. I order a plate a fruit which they completely forgot and tried to charge me for it. Thankfully I remember and got the charge voided. At the check out, a lady with white hair helped me and when I asked her for a bill she replied in a rude tone, Yeah! That's what I'm doing. Might not sound like a bad response but it's the way the person says it that has a bad effect. When I first arrived I immediately thought this was a beautiful hotel. Which it is, but I do believe the staff needs to have some costumer service orientations. (Or perhaps consider hiring younger more friendly people). Hello Angy F,Thank you for your recent visit and for leaving such thorough feedback! At Suncoast, we view all criticism as constructive and rely on it to provide better service and entertainment for our guests. Our team members strive to be friendly and personable during every interaction and are taught that service should always be prompt and accurate. It is disappointing to learn that we were unsuccessful in meeting these high standards during your time with us and I am sorry that it caused you to have less than a five star visit. Your comments will be forwarded to the appropriate management so that they can address and resolve the issues you have reported. Again, I apologize that you were not able to enjoy the high quality service Suncoast has become known for but urge you to visit in the future to experience the improvements caused by your comments."

"6418",3,"The room was clean and quiet even with the freeway right across the street. Breakfast was OK but nothing to write home about. It has an indoor heated pool but it must of been heated by the moon because we didn't feel the heat only from the jacuzzi. Other than a cool pool we had a great trip."
"6419",4,"This hotel will never be considered luxurious, BUT the charm, staff, and grounds make up for it. The rooms are comfortable and very functional. Close walk to old cocoa village, with great restaurants all within walking distance. I am local but still go out of my way to stay there!"

"6425",4,"We were very surprised at how the place had been updated. The service was very efficient and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable - the bed itself could have been better, but then the rates would probably been higher. The neighborhood was not the best and there were very few places to eat or pick up needed food or sundries. They are a pet friendly chain, which we liked if we choose to travel with our in the future. All in all, we liked the Red Roof and found it to be better than we expected."
"6426",4,"My room was spacious, immaculately clean, and pleasantly decorated. All the staff members were friendly, welcoming and efficient. My only complaint, and recommendation, would be an offered form of transportation to and from the air port. A nice accommodation would be to offer WiFi without cost."

"6443",2,"When we arrived at the hotel at 4.30PM well past the check in time of 3 PM, the clerk told us that the room was not ready, could not tell how long it would be before the room would be ready. He did not explain why the room was not ready. His attitude was that it was that way and there was nothing he could do about it. We had to wait for over one hour and only when we approached the clerk and inisted on the room then only he procedded to give us a room. The next day we returned from a late breakfast at 12:05 pm and we were not able to get into our room as the card would not unlock the door."

"6454",1,"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager"

Our neighbors however were very noisy and rowdy at 1 am and I had not been able to sleep because of all the noise,so I picked up the in room phone and called the front desk......6 times!! No answer. I then used my cell phone to call the front desk directly and they immediately picked up! I was quite upset at this point. They said they would send security to check on the noisy room. Security eventually showed up, and knocked on the wrong room! Needless to say I had to call back and finally persuaded them to switch me to a different room. So at around 2 am, there we are getting all of our stuff packed up again to switch rooms, as soon as we enter the next room, I walk up to the window and find a drone right in front of it peering in!

When we talked to an employee about the smell and were told the second floor at one time was the smoking floor. The smell was evident in both rooms. It probably was more pronounced for us, because the occupants in both rooms have never been smokers. Other than the smoking smell the rooms were fine."

"6492",2,"I book this travel for 2 of our employees for a 2 day business trip. Upon arrival they discovered one of the rooms had no bathroom light. When they contacted the desk they were asked what time they needed to take a shower because maintenance was gone. The staff seemed to not want to change his room or repair the light. After this employee got upset they then moved his room. This was a 10pm at night. The other rooms A/C was set to the lowest 60 and never got below 74. So the employee who was working in very hot conditions all day couldn't even cool off at night. Then there was the dinner. The employees found that dinner was two bowls of meat balls from 5-7pm. Nothing was replenished or taken care of. The signed in the hotel were wrong. Signed said vending but there was no vending that could be found. I was very embarrassed to have been the one to have booked this location for these two employees. I take pride in making sure all our employees have the nicest most reasonable stay possible when they have to travel for work. Now I am ashamed of this trip."
"6493",4,"The room was smaller than expected for the price paid per night. We have stayed at Indy for the motorcycle races and paid less for a much bigger room. It was also further from the Indy Race track then expected. Room was clean, comfortable, breakfast good."
"6494",5,"Our one night stay at the Modern was the perfect complement to our introduction to Boise. Hip and retro-modern rooms were beautiful and comfortable (the bed!) and spotless. It's clear a lot of thought was put into curating the guest room experience from the exclusive indie film experience available on the room tv to the door tags. AND we needed... More"
"6495",3,"A good value hotel with all the amenities you need located on the main routes into and around Washington DC. Now looking a bit tired the rooms are functional and clean. The hotel operates a complimentary minibus shuttle to any location within 3 miles of the hotel, this includes the nearest DC metro station and a large shopping mall. The hotel is located literally on a highway junction which makes getting to and leaving on the right highway an entertaining challenge. The complimentary breakfast is a good start to the day. In summary, a good value option that ticks all the right boxes for a visitor on a budget."
"6496",4,"Great place. Bed was firm, room was clean and convenient for what we needed it. A bit small but... Can't believe what they offer is considered breakfast. Can you say sugar and carbs. mini muffins, sugary cereals, and juices. Not one thing good for you! Terrible! I guess that is what an American breakfast consists of now Scary!"
"6497",5,"You do not want to miss this gem! From the moment you enter the front door to the time you leave the experience is like none other in NOLA. Beautiful hotel, great staff, rooms are perfectly cozy and a little like Vegas. Rooftop bar ambiance is clutch with a great view! Quiet and perfectly locatedThank you so much for taking the time to share this rave review of our hotel. We love hearing compliments such as this and how our property, service, and amenities created such a wonderful experience. It was our pleasure to have you as our guests and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"6498",3,"Great downtown location with easy access to local businesses and downtown historical points. Friendly staff with no frills comfortable accommodations at a fair price. Within walking distance to downtown tourist attractions. Easy to get to."
"6499",4,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Nice area with good location. Hotel currently undergoing renovation. Very clean and pleasant. Some worn/dingy room furniture, but will probably be replaced after renovations are complete."
"6500",2,"THE WORST BREAKFAST OF ANY HOTEL I'VE EVER STAYED AT. WE HAD TO GO OUT EVERY MORNING FOR BREAKFAST. ROOM HAD DOG FOOD PELLETS ON THE FLOOR. POOR CLEANING OF ROOM. THE VOLUME CONTROL OF THE TV DIDN'T WORK. THE HALL WAY TO OUR ROOM WAS EXTREMELY COLD. I WILL NEVER STAY AT AN EXTENDED STAY HOTEL EVER AGAIN. ALSO, NO POOL."
"6501",4,"We were impressed at the thoughtfulness of the staff. There is a complimentary breakfast which starts at 7:00am but we left early so we would miss it. The staff offered us bagels and bananas to take with us on the road. A small but truly appreciated gesture. The room was large and comfortable. Good for traveling with a family. The only issue was that the bathroom door did not close well. We did not address this with the hotel as we were just there overnight."
"6502",2,"If you love trains you will be able to hear them all night long as they blare their horn and roar past the motel! If you're a fan of thin pillows and rock hard beds you are home. On a positive note, the room was clean and the towels were soft. NOT worth 60!"
"6503",5,"The room was very clean and beds were extremely comfortable. The hotel staff were so very nice. The location of this hotel is perfect, right in the midst of downtown but not so loud that one cannot rest. We had the best time and this hotel, by far, is one of my favorites. We love the City of New Orleans... More"
"6504",1,"Room smelled like cigarette smoke. Bunch of guys from another room having a party, being rowdy and getting drunk in parking lot right near office until 3AM. Clerk did nothing to quiet them down, call the police, etc. I was a little concerned when door to office locked at night and saw a sign for weekly rates. I will no longer stay in motels with outside doors. Accommodations would not have been terrible but I guess when room is too cheap, maybe doesn't attract best crowd."
"6505",4,"Bad: Friendlier folks at the front desk...they are the first staff one interacts with at your hotel. They need to make eye contact and smile more. Interact with guests...make you feel welcome. Good: Housekeeping was awesome !!!"
"6506",4,"We stopped at the Best Western Plus on our way down to New Orleans. We arrived after 11pm and left the next morning at 7am so we weren't there for very long. The check-in process went smoothly and quickly. The rooms were nice and comfortable. It was nice that they offered free bottled water, Wi-Fi, and breakfast. The breakfast was... More"
"6507",4,"Bad: One lonely and confused roach in the bathroom. Breakfast, but since we're Europeans this may be a matter of taste. Good: Spacious, comfortable rooms with air conditioning and dehumidifiers too. Nice reception area with a 24hrs possibility to buy toiletries, snacks, etc. Very close to the Disney parks and just next to a great Asian restaurant."
"6508",5,"I am staying at this hotel for business and it has exceeded expectations! Absolutely gorgeous, great location, superb amenities, super comfy bed.....I could go on and on. If you're visiting New Orleans STAY HERE.....you won't be disappointed!Jessie, Thank you for your great review on TripAdvisor. Your recommendation means a lot to us and we hope to welcome you back again soon. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaire General Manager"
"6509",5,"For the cost of this hotel, I was extremely surprised on how nice, clean and modern looking it was. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful with anything we needed, but most importantly I felt comfortable there because it was safe and secure and the inside and outside was well kept. I also found out it was recently remodeled. Would def stay there again."

"6518",4,"Our room was clean, comfortable, and large. It had a fridge and microwave. There was no freezer, which was disappointing, but not that big of a deal.The hotel is in a good location, close to many restaurants. The breakfast had a great variety of hot and cold item.

"6521",5,"It's rare that we ever stay in an independent hotel, but that's mostly what you find in Pismo Beach. From the first greeting to every contact with staff the customer service is excellent.

"6522",5,"The staff was remarkable. I was only there 2 nights, and in that short time 3 different people went out of their way to make sure I had what I needed. Absolutely superb staff! I'm a frequent traveler, and your people made this a very enjoyable experience."

"6526",4,"Great for customer service and their follow up call. Comfortable room but the horn blasts from the train nearby is loudly heard few times especially at 2 am. According to front staff, the train horn blasts is mandated but the rooms facing the courtyard is quieter when this was mentioned during checkout. We misplaced sunglasses and called the hotel to...

"6527",5,"Hands down, the best hotel I've ever stayed! Helpful and friendly staff. Cozy and well kept rooms. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. Also, very easy to get to. The wait staff at the Irish Pub attatched to the hotel makes you feel a part of their family. I can't wait to come back!"
"6528",3,"This Best Western is located on the beach. Some cons are: the parking in front of the hotel is quite tight and spaces limited and the pool is located across the street (there is also a parking garage across the street.) This hotel is located where you can walk to some restaurants and beach shops but it's also a bit away from the heart of things as well. The free continental breakfast was adequate, had hot cold choices, a couple fruit juices, coffee, milk and some fresh apples and oranges to offer. The hotel staff was amazingly nice and accommodating, going above and beyond --in my opinion. This isn't the newest of hotels with aging decor and a semi-cold fridge in my room, but the price and location were perfect for this trip!"
"6529",4,"Good: The serviceminded staff in the reception (specially Maria)"
"6530",5,"Bad: My preference for a mattress is more on the harder side so my back was rather sore in the mornings after waking up. But it seems like most American hotels have rather soft beds so I am not sure if this is something that bothers other people or not."
"6531",1,"First time we had stayed at this resort, we chose this report for its location and it was one of the more expensive hotels so presumed it would be good !!!! Room was in very poor condition and very worn out as a lot of the communal areas were, air condition couldn't be left on as the noise was horrendous... More"
"6532",5,"Bad: To be honest, nothing to complain about. Just too bad that there wasn't any free wifi in the rooms. Good: Considering that we only paid 88 dollars for 2 persons for 2 nights, this was great value for money. The hotel is located in the middle of Fremont Street, so you just step outside and you are in the middle of the action. Our room was on the 9th floor and we didn't hear any noise whatsoever. The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel. We just needed to walk 2 mins to access their facilities. The gym was really good equipped for a hotel gym. Pool was really nice and quiet. Would definitely stay here again!"
"6533",5,"Our utility company needed to make upgrades to the sytem in our neighborhood and therefore, had to cut power for the day. We decided on a staycation, as the hotel was only 15 miles from our home. I'm glad we made the decision. The accomodations were large, comfortable and clean. We appreciated the manager's reception and our daughter loved the pool. As for room service- the quality was there and the gentleman who brought our food was kind and courteous. We plan to stay again soon."
"6534",5,"This hotel exceeded all my expectations. It is conveniently located and a short drive to everything San Diego has to offer. Marcia and Elisa at the front desk were incredibly helpful and friendly making my stay all the better. They went out of their way to answer any questions and make recommendations as to what to see. Thanks again!"
"6535",4,"Bad: noisy room heater/AC unit. Good: location, small comfortable room."
"6536",3,"Stop over prior to a trip to Orlando. Convenient. Airport shuttle big plus"
"6537",5,"The hotel was excellent and the staff were great! The cleaning people and night desk staff were especially nice and helpful, and they even made a dog out of towels once. The room had a small refrigerator which was a nice surprise, and the gym was surprisingly well-stocked with equipment."
"6538",4,"Great shower! 24' gym is nice.rooms a little dated."
"6539",4,"Staff was very helpful and responsive. The rooms, pool and parking were not as clean or good as usual embassy suites but in no means bad for the value."
"6540",5,"Comfortable beautiful historic hotel in the heart of this part of the city. Walkable to great restaurants and shops. Great place to stay and will stay again!"
"6541",3,"Hotel was generally good but the breakfast was extremely disorganized, slow, and eventually i just gave up."
"6542",5,"Arriving after a long flight, it was a delight to find such a tranquil, beautiful haven. My room was large and full of lovely antiques and there was everything a tired traveller could wish for. I've already recommended it to a friend."
"6543",5,"Bad: I had someone partying and playing super loud music above me or next to me all night. Got no sleep."
"6544",5,"Everything was great. Staff was friendly and helpful. They had no problem giving us a late checkout when we needed it. Overall great experience."
"6545",5,"Great location. Front desk staff very accommodating. Will go back."
"6546",4,"My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!"
"6547",4,"Great hotel in the heart of Union Square at a very reasonable rate. We were attending an event at ATT park and Earlier that day we devided to stay in the SF overnight. The Marquis had rooms available, at a great rate and close to ATT (9.00 UBER ride). The hotel is beautiful and our room was immaculate. Staff is very friendly and kind. The only negative was on the day of our arrival, we waited on Mission Street for an hour to have valet park our car. The valet attendants were very apologetic and the desk clerk upon hearing how long it took, gave us an early check-in. I would most definitely stay here again!"
"6548",4,"We had a sour taste in our mouths from a previous stay in a Holiday Inn Express and were leary about staying in one again, we had no choice so we booked a room here. The staff was VERY friendly and very attentive to our needs, especially the shuttle bus driver Tina who went above and beyond her duties to... More"
"6549",1,"The stay was for business and the room booked through my office. It was prepaid through Expedia. The room was FILTHY!!! Stains, burn marks, bugs, and it smelled terribly of smoke (booked a non-smoking room). The bathroom was extremely dirty and there was no way I could shower in it. One light in the room worked, all others did not. I video taped it because I had never experienced anything like this. I immediately went back to the manager and expressed my concern. He would not give me a refund so I told him I would take it up with my office and their credit card company. There was no way I was going to stay there. I drove home 2 hours and had to drive back the next day for my business event. It was that bad and I refused to stay there."
"6550",4,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff, convenient to the airport. We stayed here during an NFL football game and I couldn't be happier. The hotel was close to the airport and downtown Atlanta, the staff were very friendly (even though we were fans of the opposing team). Our stay included parking, wifi, and breakfast"
"6551",5,"My wife and I always stay at this location when needed when traveling to Ohio. We have never had a single problem here. The rooms are clean, prices are right, and this is the perfect hotel for our one night stays. I highly recommend this hotel."
"6552",2,"You get what you pay for. I will leave it at that."
"6553",4,"Nice room, clean and comfortable. Bathroom was roomy with great shower head, shower curtain and granite countertop. They provide a coffee station, refrigerator and microwave. We will definitely stay here again while visiting family. One of the nicest Super 8's we have stayed."
"6554",4,"Room was amazing but the breakfast was lacking in selection. The breakfast was free and the quality of what was there was very good. I would stay at this location again if work brought me back trough this area"
"6555",4,"Great stay. Staff was good."
"6556",5,"This was our second time staying at the Maple Leaf Motel. Cindy, the owner / manager takes great pride in the cleanliness of the rooms. And she loves her flowers! It is a gem right on the main road into Charlevoix. Prices are reasonable. This is definitely our go-to place to stay in that area of the State."
"6557",5,"Good: I liked the uniqueness of the hotel, and especially the rooms. Great view out our balcony."
"6558",4,"As a whole experience was good, would stay again, but in a room that was not so close to general hotel activities. staff friendly and pleasant. No bath mat and soap in bathroom doing second day of stay."
"6559",5,"My experience in this hotel was perfect! Rooms are clean, well-appointed, not so big but privided of all comforts (Tv, coffee machine, bathroom, and free wifi). In each floor, near the lift, you can find a free water dispenser with new bottles and also some chocolates and candys. Every day at 5.00pm, in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts. The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city. It is located in the loop (the city center) on the river in front of the Trump tower. It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile (two of the most touristics place in the city). Moreover the hotel is close (5-7minutes by walk) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport. The staff of the hotel is extremly avaible and ready to meet all you needs. I was in chicago for a business travel so i can't give you informations about costs because i didn't manage the booking of the hotel. Anyway, after my experience, absolutly, I would suggest this hotel for a pleasant and comfortable stay in chicago.Dear Concetta D,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to provide a detailed review of your experience. We are thrilled to know you found everything to your liking. We really enjoy passing on comments such as yours to our colleagues and thanking them for their great guest service.We sincerely appreciate your recommendation!"
"6560",4,"This is a nice little hotel with a great view overlooking a small marina. Nice rooms and inexpensive. Free parking. No reception staff after 7PM but they will leave you a key to your room. A bit outside Clearwater but some nice restaurants close by. Definitely a good place to stay if you have access to a car."
"6561",4,"The Saint is about as well located as any place in key west. There are 2 (hidden) side entrances/exits as well as the main one on Eaton street. if you use a gps, DO NOT enter the Duval street address -- you will end up going in circles.Main entrance is up a few steps. you can park in front for 15 minutes, and if you have luggage, go inside and ask for help.room 113 is on the main floor, and mostly dark since the shutters need to be kept shut during the daytime (there is a busy walkway right outside and anyone can see in -- for same reason, it can be a bit noisy at times)the entire property is funky, in a playful way. photos on this site will show you why.staff is friendly and anxious to please. any major problems should go to the general manager, abraham, who is eager to make the hotel as good as possible.oh, the location. no car is needed. you are 5 minute walk to truman white house, 10 minutes or less to mallory park/sunset pier. also greene street is the same area and has a lively night life as well as key lime pie stores every few steps.hemingway house is towards the other end of Duval street, but can be reached in less than 20 minutes if you don't stop at all the stores and eateries along this main street. go another 10 minutes or less, and you will be at the end of Duval, and reach the southernmost point in the continental u.s. -- where the famous buoy sits. you may need to wait on line a few minutes to take a photo at that spot. also, a great cafe right on the beach there. finally, for dinner, you can almost throw a dart and find a terrific place within walking distance of the saint. have fun!Dear ischloss,We greatly appreciate that you took the time to write such a thorough review about your recent stay at The Saint Hotel Key West. We hope that when your travels bring you back to Key West, you will once again choose The Saint and give us another to earn that 5-star rating!Cheers!"
"6562",5,"Wonderful stay! The hotel was amazing. Modern, superb location, clean and wasn't expecting a full kitchen. The staff was wonderful!! Especially Brennan!! Very helpful! Breakfast buffet is top notch! Create your own omelet!"
"6563",4,"This hotel recently went through an update in regards to the furniture and televisions. I have to say that they did a great job. They didn't. however, replace the tile in the bathrooms to match the rest of the updates, which is a shame. The tub and pedestal sink looked new, but the toilet did not. But I have to say, that the bathroom was the cleanest I have ever seen. Not even one stray hair on the floor! The kitchen also skipped the update, but it was still nice to have a fridge, microwave and stove. All the essential items like utensils, dinnerware and cookware were stocked in the cabinets. Also, there is no wi-fi in the rooms, you have to go to the lobby. There is only a plug for high speed internet located in the room. The hotel is a great bargain for staying near D.C. and I would stay there in a heartbeat."
"6564",4,"Lots of construction if your not paying attention you will miss your exit. The hotel doesn't look like much on the outside but it has been renovated. Quiet, comfortable stay"

"6581",2,"I want to first say that this hotel is in a prime location. You are steps away from the trolley pick up for city place and clematis. Upon arrival I thought the hotel was very nice.

"6598",2,"Sadly in need of total facelift. Not so clean, beds comfy but in need of linen update. Old TV. Kind of felt like I needed to check for crawlies. You get what you pay for. Would not return and would not recommend."

"6602",5,"second time that I stay in this hotel, and it was great. Great location, within walking distance to both inner harbor and Fells Point, with plenty of bars and restaurants and shopping. the hotel is right around the corner from a couple of great restaurants (my fave: Ten/Ten) and Whole Foods. the staff is always very nice but the hostess at the front couldn't figure out where the rooms with a view of the harbor were, so although she tried to accommodate our request, we ended up with a room facing the opposite direction, looking at a brick wall... other than than, the hotel is great. very convenient bar/snack station in the lobby, great hot breakfast, and fabulous gym (small pool)."

"6611",2,"Was really excited to stay in a historical hotel. Got in very late and requested a very quite room. Was informed that there would be no one at the front desk after 11:00. Got in my room and settled in, noticed toothpaste in the sink, hair on the floor and in the tub but of course by this time there was no one at the front desk..Turned the TV off and went to bed but the music from the nightclub kept me awake until they closed at 2:am. I will never stay there again! Very disappointed!!"

"6613",4,"Bad: Problems with door lock led to no response from maintenance and even after security got us in, they failed to fix the lock (had to be recoded) despite assuring us they fixed it. So we got locked out again the next morning. Cost us 2 frustrating hours. Good: Location is good for business, quiet but close to everything."
"6614",5,"Bad: Only 1 street parking spot to get registerd. Valet parking was not convenient. Did not even know where my car was at and not being able to retrieve my beach chairs, etc. Extra charge was put on account after departure but management removed it. Good: The view"

Expected cramped however, was pleasently surprised by it's size. Restaurant and convenience stores within walking distance. The Hotel is in a residential neighborhood, not much activity surrounding it. Although there is a fee for parking, It was the cheapest in the area."

"6620",5,"It's like any other hotel at this class but the staffs were friendly , room was clean full break-fast plenty of food and drink , the shuttle service to and from subway(metro) is free anytime you like , it's worth the cost of hotel fare.

"6624",2,"We checked in and noticed an odor similar to cat urine in first floor room. I called front desk, they contacted housekeeping and she came immediately to spray and request an ozone something. I called front desk back and asked for another room. They did not have one with two queens so we took a king. The front desk asked if we wanted a roll away and I said yes. We left for dinner and when we returned, no rollaway. I did not call desk back. All of us crammed on the king bed."
"6625",5,"It was my first time staying with aloft but now it has become my top choices. The location was great and accessible to trolleys and within walking distance to many spots. The room was well decorated with many chargers. Front desk was really helpful and friendly. The only problem is the terrible sound insulation that I could hear my next door clearly. Many leisures in hotel but I was too busy to explore. Definitely coming back for my next stay in Philly.Hi Jane, We are thrilled you're coming back to Philly and of course our hotel!!! The FIVE BUBBLE review is much appreciated!!! Everyone needs to stay powered up. Thanks for noticing how we placed USB ports all over the hotel!!

"6636",5,"I had no complaints and would stay again. I have stayed at several different Hampton Inns and this was as nice as any others I've I stayed. The staff was friendly, the room was nice and clean, and breakfast, although the typical Hampton fare, was great."
"6637",2,"Old run down furniture, room needed to be repainted, peeling paint, curtains ripped and dirty, carpet ok, but room was not as clean as it should be. Only good items in room was bed, tv, refrigerator, microwave, balcony room, shower head. Bathroom wasn't properly cleaned and definitely needs to be spruced up. Facility itself is nice with attractive lobby, pool, convenient."

"6639",4,"We really enjoyed our stay. There was nothing to complain about. The suite was exceptionally clean."
"6640",5,"We felt like home. We are planning to go back in the near future. The staff is very polite. Viginia Suites is within walking distance from mass transit and that make it easy to travel to the main atractions in Washington D.C. We highly recommend Virginia Suites to any one planning to visit Washington."
"6641",3,"Bad: The bed was so uncomfortable that I am still soar tired a day from being home. The curtain would not close completely to block out pole light."
"6642",3,"This hotel is in an awful area, and the pictures make it look really nice, in reality the pool is tiny and next to a car park, the water was freezing, and the general customer base at breakfast was a little out of my comfort zone. It was an overnight stop for me and I arrived late and left early,... More"

"6644",5,"Cannot say enough good about this place! The addition of the peddle boats and paddle boards really seal the deal that this is the best place on Canada Street! Something for the kids poolside everyday, movies and popcorn and snow cones. This is our second year and I am certain there will be many more to come!"
"6645",1,"I would never stay at this hotel again. My room in the south tower, 1927 was filthy dirty and it looked like the carpets had not been cleaned in years. The lamp was broken, the wall by the AC looked like it had severe water damage and probably mold. I woke up to cold showers every morning and the shower... More"
"6646",2,"Econolodge it is. It was cheap in price, and accommodations as well. Rooms looks just like what the name implies an old roadside motor lodge. The room size is very small, and our king size bed had what looked to be a queen size blanket on it. I will say that the bathroom was clean, although the size of a... More"
"6647",3,"In theory, I like the idea of a suite style Hampton, however, my room was still small and I was not particularly fond of the layout. I did miss having a work desk and comfortable chair.

"6648",5,"This was the nicest SpringHill Suites I've stayed at. Beautiful lobby and room, the staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the price was awesome for summertime. The airport shuttle was quick and efficient. The hotel was very clean. I'd definitely recommend you staying here."
"6649",3,"The bed was very comfortable, however the iron did not work properly and water seeped out of the bottom of the iron. Water drained from the bottom of the shower and I had to put towels on the floor around the shower to prevent falling. The room was dusty, the colors in the room were not inviting or appealing. I think a complimentary brunch would have been nice. If you are going to put coffee makers in the rooms at least give the customer something to stir the hot coffee."
"6650",3,"Check in is easy. Close to gas stations and food. Room for truck and RV parking. Rooms are basic and hotel clean. Wifi is good and continental breakfast is good. Pet friendly. I stay here 2-3 times per year and it's a solid hotel, I feel safe and the accommodations are what I would expect for the price."
"6651",3,"I was excited to find this place for a road trip down the Oregon coast, since it had such great reviews from other travelers. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a disappointment. It's located right on the 101, so while very convenient, the road noise is pretty loud in the room (especially if you keep your window open - no... More"
"6652",4,"We were in town to visit family in Corpus and had never stayed at The Tarpon Inn. My children were with us so we needed enough room for 5 and room 42 was perfect! AND they are pet friendly. Being within walking distance to so many restaurants was a bonus. The staff couldn't have been nicer. Will recommend to my... More"
"6653",5,"Don't misunderstand - we would fully recommend the hotel itself. The restaurant Pizzazz Tuscan Grille is another story. Food was OK, portions were small for the and service was bad. There are much better choices nearby."
"6654",3,"Stayed 5 nights at this property. Clean and well maintained property. Front desk staff were very polite and courteous . My room rate included breakfast.

"6658",4,"Staying on El Camino can be noisy, but this motel had many rooms that are away from traffic. Ask for a quiet room. Property was clean and, well, comfortable. Breakfast was better than others I've had at similar properties. This was my first time here, and I'll return."
"6659",5,"My husband and I stayed here as a last minute weekend getaway and we couldn't be more pleased. I'm not a fan of Atlanta, however, this area is great. The hotel is directly across the street from the Perimeter Mall (walking distance). The check-in and out process was easy, all the staff were very friendly. There was some sort of... More"
"6660",5,"Excellent hotel with a very up-market feel in a great location. Right on Ocean Drive but quite."
"6661",5,"We could not have had a better stay at the Mills House Hotel. Every detail was managed well. Because of our recent bookings at other hotels in this chain, we were automatically upgraded to their priority club. Great amenities came with the upgrade, which made our stay more enjoyable. The entire staff was friendly, courteous, and professional. The front desk and concierge made dinner suggestions and reservations for us both nights, with which we were very satisfied. We could not have stayed in a better hotel. We will stay there again if we return."
"6662",5,"The rooms were very spacious. The beds were very comfortable. The breakfast was tasty with a variety of items from breakfast sandwiches, cereal, oatmeal, waffles, bagels, various juices, fruit, and yogurt. The amenities were plenteous. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will return when we come back to the area."
"6663",3,"pleasant, restful night stay"
"6664",5,"Excellent stay! The room was beautiful, comfortable and clean. Sheets were crisp and very white. Food was superior to the usual hotel fare.

"6668",5,"Bad: When I made the reservation, they told me one thing. When I got there, the first person told me something different. Third person resolved it. Good: The staff was excellent!!initially I didn't get the room I asked for when I made the reservation. They wasted no time correcting the situation. Made my birthday stay very pleasant! Excellent location."
"6669",2,"Before I booked this hotel I reviewed comments and rating which indicated I would be satisfied. Unfortunately, I was highly DISAPPOINTED! The hotel elevator had a bad smell, my air conditioner worked best at night, I could hear my neighbors conversation and to make my stay really memorable someone was banging on a hotel door. As for security the hotel has a door that is NOT locked and is located next to the elevator. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!"
"6670",5,"Good: Perfect Location, friendly staff, amazing rooms."
"6671",5,"Stayed here to finish my last week of work before preparing to move to Las Vegas! Very comfortable, great staff, housekeepers were awesome!"
"6672",3,"Very busy, efficient-enough airport location. Rooms quite OK.. housekeeping fine.. but hotel is getting run down. Some modern era touches lacking, i.e., not enough power outlets near desk or bed. Staff tries hard to accommodate guests. Irksome and preposterous 50/night 'incidentals' charge which is returned post-stay."
"6673",5,"The staff at Home 2 Suites is terrific! As a frequent business guest, they remember you by name and always create a welcoming atmosphere. The rooms are well laid out and perfect for the business traveler."
"6674",4,"I got a great deal on this place on Hotels.com for 81/night. Otherwise, I wouldn't have chanced it. I've always stayed at the name brand hotels and didn't see anything appealing about this hotel from their pictures online. I stayed for two nights in a room on the second floor of building 6. The lobby is kind of strange. There... More"
"6675",4,"Easy access from I5 for an overnight stay in the way further south. Front staff was very friendly and helpful. The evening reception offer is also a very nice touch. We enjoyed the soup and salad bar. When you check in you are given coupons for a free drink -- beer, wine, well drinks or pop. Our room was neat... More"
"6676",1,"The towels were stained. The comforter had burn holes in it. The tub grips were starting to turn black. And there were bugs in the bed. My sister and I ended up sleeping on top of the covers because it was a holiday weekend and nowhere else had vacancies."
"6677",3,"The location of this hotel was amazing and the price was right. Unfortunately, it was a weekend and the hotel was hosting a wedding. As a result, it was very loud. I was assured by the staff that it would end around 10:30, but the party was yelling and slamming doors until at least 11:30. There was a note in my room to respect quiet time from 10p-6a, but I guess that applied only to me. I had an early morning event to attend, so I wouldn't recommend staying here on a weekend if you intend to get any rest. Also, my room had a shared bath, which was very poorly treated by whomever else was sharing it. Be advised that sometimes other guests might not be as civilized as you are."
"6678",5,"We stayed here for 3 days this past weekend. This is a jewel for Rockland maine, a must stay for the art lover and inspiration for the artist when visiting the area. An enormous amount of thought was put into the design of this property. Beautiful prints are located throughout the hotel. Each floor has a common area that is... More"

"6680",1,"We have eaten at many other McMenamins before so for my son's birthday we chose the one in McMinnville since we were there for a track meet at Linfield. BIG MISTAKE!!!! Order was screwed up with two meals not delivered until everyone else was through waiters changed in the middle, and the bill charged us one meal too much. Not happy."
"6681",2,"The room was small. Not what was expected for 340.00 a night. My debit card was charged twice and took days to get it reversed. Manager was helpful, but did not offer any other discounts on stay even though it was their fault."
"6682",4,"This motel is reasonable, prices are good and the rooms are clean. I will be back and plan to stay again. I felt safe while i was here, and the owner lives on the property, which makes it easy to get him when i need somthing. Coffee was available in the mornings and i was offered a coffee pot for...

Full hot breakfast that was fresh and yummy even crispy bacon and lots of fresh fruit. The room was spacious with an exceptionally comfortable bed. We would definitely stay here again."
"6685",3,"Hotel was nice. Had to ask for towels. Room were cleaned late in day. Came back from beach and no clean towels. Wifi cost extra, parking was 35/day to hand them my keys. No complimentary breakfast. Not a 4 star experience. Stayed at a Marriott last year, much better"

The tv remote battery cover was missing and had been taped, the alarm clock was showing the wrong time and it had no battery cover or batteries, couldn't figure how to set the time. The ceilingabove the bed had a big dark stain, there was a small tear in the couch... More"
"6690",2,"I spent two nights at the Metro Points Hotel. The Hotel Guests was somewhat in some of term is seemed to be helpful. The reasons I took points off because Breakfast Foods were awful. The chef used pre-packages on most of the buffet foods. The hospitality of the service was very negative. 10 charged for using microwaves is ridiculous! There is no another way to heating up my foods from take-out place. Not the best family hotel to book it. Probably more for last minute business trip. ."
"6691",5,"Cleaning staff takes pride in their work and it shows. Clean, friendly, updated, warm and nice pool area!"
"6692",4,"Stayed here one night and it was great! Comfy beds, nice shower, very clean. The owner was very friendly and helpful. It was within walking distance to everything. Pool was very nice and clean. The grounds were spotless and the place was charming. Can't beat the room rates. I definitely would return!"
"6693",5,"Always a friendly and courteous staff. Very good value for the money. We usually always stop here on our way to Colorado and the location right off the interstate makes it easy to get to the hotel and easy to get started the next morning."
"6694",5,"We enjoyed our stay at this suite hotel. The entire staff was very helpful and accommodating. The AC unit in our room needed repair, and within 5 minutes, a maintenance staff member promptly arrived and had it fixed within 30 minutes! The front desk staff were extremely helpful with directions to transportation, local grocery stores within walking distance, even printing our boarding passes for our flight home! Thank you all!"
"6695",3,"Bad: Price for valet No dining on site Housekeeping. Good: Price"
"6696",4,"The staff here was so nice and helpful. The room was clean and spacious. I would recommend staying here if I was in the area. The fitness room is very small so if it is booked you may have to wait for equipment."
"6697",3,"Pros: the location is awesome, the room size is great, the bathroom is nice also with a nice tub. Bad: the style and furniture starts to get really old, no breakfast despite the high price, the price is high, nothing exeptionnal... We were 4 people and so 4 reservations. Unfortunately one was missing. It was 1am so very bad surprise.... More"
"6698",4,"So there is nothing wrong with this hotel. It is average and what you would expect of Holiday Inn Express. I am glad that we got the reservations on Hotels.com. The rooms were conveniently priced and I thought the services of the hotel were fine for the price I had paid. However, when we inquired about staying an extra day the room cost twice as much. I understand that getting reservations early and using a service like hotels.com is much cheaper but I could not see paying twice as much money for such a mediocre hotel."
"6699",3,"This is a funky, refurbished, older Tahoe hotel that is in a good location. It's right on Stateline, across from Harvey's, and walking distance to the beach.

"6701",5,"Great space and the bed was heavenly. The only critiques I had were the fact that I had to pay 15 for wifi and there was no room service, both of which surprised me about a hotel at this price point."
"6702",5,"The service in this hotel is excellent. The rooms were lovely, clean and spacious. The bathroom was fab -- had good lighting and lots of space. The lobby/bar/pool area is chic and made a great, not too loud place to meet friends each night I was there. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful -- truly the best hotel I have stayed at in a long time."
"6703",5,"This is a nice hotel with a nice breakfast area that is well kept and the food was fresh and tasty. There was a lot of seating so we did not have to wait for someone to leave so we could eat. It was a stay on the go so we did not use the facilites much. The room was... More"

"6707",4,"Bad: There was an anti-noise device plugged into each of two sockets to compensate for the fact they are in a noisy road. In fact, this emits itself a loud roaring sound. When unplugged, things were fine. The road noise was not bad at all (we were on the 12th floor). One of the senior staff kindly refunded a breakfast bill given this and another issue (cordless phone by the bed wouldn't stop beeping through the night). The restaurant and room service were extremely expensive. There was a slight sense too that some of the decor (wood-appearance veneer on cabinets, shower curtain not panel ) was a bit cheap and scuffed given the price. Good: Staff were great - thoughtful, friendly and clearly dedicated to running it well.Decor and atmosphere of front lounge area welcoming and stylish. Location is very good."

"6720",5,"Our stay was great. We had a very restful night and plan on staying again next month."
"6721",4,"The hotel offered many amenities that were beneficial to us for the reason for our stay such as, comfortable rooms and breakfast. Upon arrival a round trip service from the hotel to stadium was being offered for 20 dollars a person. We immediately jumped on the deal due to being unfamiliar with the area, as well as my wife expecting our first baby. She is restricted to the amount of walking she is to do and we didn't want to walk to and from the metro station in the dark. Our driver never picked us up at the drop off location, when speaking to him he misled us to where we were to go to meet him, he hung up on us and a police officer, and shut off his phone. We didn't get picked up until an hour and half after the game by the boss of the company. The whole ordeal was very frustrating and unorganized. We did get half of our money back from the second driver/boss of the company. When returning to the hotel the staff didn't seem concerned with the mishap. I don't think the hotel hired a credible company to provide shuttle services to their guests. Any guest should be cautious about using an outside shuttle service provided by this hotel."
"6722",1,"Room had wall paper and curtain falling down Plus blanket was dirty. Can deal with that but we had no heat and maintenence staff would not be back until the morning. Room was freezing cold. I have pictures if Expedia wants to see them. Remove this hotel from your listing please."

The bathroom was nicely updated... More"
"6725",4,"Bad: Room was a little tired.

"6747",3,"Bad: I was overcharged at the property and after two requests to front desks no one got back to me. The third time I went to follow up myself. They overcharged me 130 dollars for the room. The hotel was under renovation so it was not good being on a partial construction site with the sound of drills going off. I would advise to shop around on the strip. Good: Bed was comfortable"

Super friendly staff, rooms are really really clean, delicious hot and cold breakfast items (complimentary) and are replenished the entire time, so you don't get left with the scraps if your running late, 24/7 hot fresh coffee in the lobby, and they even have yummy fresh cookies on the front desk to grab after a long day at the job. It's the small things, like the receptacle outlets located ABOVE the nightstand so you don't have to do furniture reconfigurations to plug in your phone! The internet stays on. Yea, it really stay on all the time with no unexpected drops. Also, the TV is real TV....not the Hotel-Guided limited channel system. So, believe me when I say this is a nice hotel. It really is. ) It's safe....quit looking.....book, now."

"6754",5,"Bad: Nothing. Good: Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. The cleanliness of the facility was also great. We have stayed at the Westin a few times and will continue in the future."
"6755",5,"I thought the hotel was very nice. The staff was wonderful! They were very helpful and friendly. Only thing I did not like was the hotel allowed smoking out in front of the main entrance. It is fine with me if people choose to smoke, but when you are waiting for a shuttle and have about 6 or more people standing around you smoking it is a little uncomfortable for those who do not smoke. The only other thing that I did not like was one day when we were on the shuttle there was a young women already on when we got on. I am not sure if she was an employee of the hotel but it was clear she was not a hotel guest. I do not know your rules on people riding your shuttle but here is what the problem was this women took up 2 seats - the shuttle was full and people, guest of the hotel, had to stand. If she was not a guest of the hotel (which from her conversation with the driver I am guessing she was not) the drive should of had her stand so that people who paid to stay at the hotel could be seated. If she was an employee of the hotel she needed to move over to allow a guest to sit with her and not take up two seats. That was a little disappointing but that being said the shuttle service was great. Right on time every day you have to love that! It was my son's first time to D.C. thank you for making it a great trip."
"6756",4,"We enjoyed our stay at the Mills House. It was in a great area and we could walk to everything. We chose this hotel because of the area and the pool. We had two kids who enjoyed the pool very much! The valets at this hotel were very helpful and accommodating!"

I will be staying there again next time I vacation to Charleston!"
"6760",4,"Let me start by saying I wanted some place safe and clean with WIFI. My adult son and I were exhausted after visiting schools and driving all day. We had many choices and I choose the cheapest place. I have no regrets. As others have mentioned, the showers were not the hottest, the lobby was dingy but so what. The... More"
"6761",5,"I stayed for three days and I quite enjoyed it. It's quite a distance from the Strip but the mellowness and the view from my room was worth it. Although the decor in the rooms were a little outdated, they were very clean and very SPACIOUS! The one thing I liked about the rooms was that it did not have the adjoining locked doors to the next room, so privacy was well in tact. The safe and fridge were also a plus. Adding to the spaciousness, the bathrooms was quite also large. I had two sinks in one area and then the toilet and shower in a separate part of the bathroom separated by a door. I ate at the buffet for the three days I was there. The selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was the same each day but was worth the price especially if you signed up for the casino card. You can't beat eating at a buffet for 8+ for breakfast and 11+ for dinner. Sorry, I could not remember how much I paid exactly, but know for sure that it was way cheaper to eat there than at one of the buffets at the Strip. I'd definately stay here again!"
"6762",5,"We had a 2 night stay. The room was immaculate and comfortable. The breakfast was outstanding, many choices and home cooked options that were delicious. The staff were helpful and took pride in their place. Would definitely stay here again...great location, too. A great find."
"6763",4,"Bad: No pool :(. Good: The perfect Location"
"6764",1,"Second time in a row that we have had an awful experience with the hotel booked through your website. Your website gave the hotel 3.2 stare. I would agree if the scale was out of 100, not 5. One of the two queen beds had the mattress springs bulging through surface. The bathroom was dirty and I killed 3 roaches."
"6765",4,"The hotel itself was fine--accommodating and clean, and the room was spacious. I found the bed, however (a SleepNumber bed) very uncomfortable and couldn't manage to change the preset number. The restaurant was just so-so. The food wasn't very tasty. On the night we checked in I had a grilled chicken sandwich with roasted peppers and pesto that I thought would be really good--the sandwich was heavy on the roasted peppers but the pesto was almost non-existent. The following morning we had the buffet breakfast. It was a wonderful spread--fruits, cereal, eggs, potatoes, sausages, french toast sticks--but the pastries and french toast were stale and the eggs seemed very bland. On the plus side the waiter said that if we didn't want scrambled eggs we could have eggs made to order (we hadn't complained, he simply offered that). So I'm fine with the hotel in general (I admit the bed problem may be mine alone), but wish the restaurant was as good as the bed."
"6766",4,"We are quite happy with our choice. The receptionists are generally friendly and helpful. We found it convenient to have a courtesy van. The breakfast is very good."
"6767",5,"The front desk man was very rude. If I didn't like the indoor pool I would never go back again. He was very arrogant and acted as if he didn't care if our stay was enjoyable. Told me false information and made it difficult for me to check in.They need to rehire a new front desk person if I ever see him again I'm turning the other way."
"6768",1,"I stayed here for 1 night and discovered bed bugs in the morning. My back was covered in bites and there were multiple bugs under my pillow.

"6772",5,"Bad: Rooftop bar is more style than substance, go to be seen, not to enjoy view or surroundings, and inconvenient to have to go downstairs to go back up. Perhaps a residents hour for hotel guests only, when lift can go directly up. Good: Great location, very stylish, helpful staff especially the doormen"
"6773",3,"Decent hotel if you could get it for the right price. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it for families. Great for young people on a budget"
"6774",5,"This hotel is in a very convenient location. Only 15 minutes to Tulip Town and Roozengaarde.

"6775",3,"The hotel is clean, size of the room was good and the pool area is nice, but the overall look of the place is cheesy, the AC in the room was noisy and hard to control, and there's no free internet!

"6779",4,"When we 1st arrived the staff was extremely friendly. The check in was swift as far as check ins go but they checked us in to an already occupied room. OMG! Can you imagine entering your room family in tow and there is someone sleeping in the bed. I was frighten, embarrassed and angry. We returned downstairs and the couple was already calling down about the intrusion. The staff apologized profusely and immediately gave us an empty room. Needless to say I had a hard time sleeping that night worried that someone might walk into our room but that never happened. The rest of the stay was worry free. The only other issue was the breakfast time. Breakfast at the Hyatt Place was from 6:30am-9am. That's awful early for people traveling with kids or on vacation. I'd like to take a moment to thank the staff. They were courteous and friendly especially Rosalind and Adriel. Thank you for a nice stay."

"6784",3,"Bad: I will write in English so the staff can read if they wish: we arrived exactly at 4 PM (declared check in time), the room was not ready, the reason being 20 people having done an early check in, please notice that check out time is 11 AM (so they clearly have a workforce planning problem)! An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message. At that time your room will be available!. So we went to the pool (definitely small and overcrowded), no seats available, very noisy. We waited, and waited and waited and waited... 2 hours and 20 minutes, then I went back to the lobby extremely upset, I started complaining and magically the room was ready...

"6795",5,"Got married last year at the Aria Chapel and stayed in the hotel for 10 days. We had a great time with our family and friends. Brittany from the wedding staff was very helpfull and nice. The hotel is brand new and very clean, everything is modern. Besides the casino, it have a large entertainment structure, filled up with shows,... More"
"6796",2,"I was very disappointed in this hotel. It was not what I expected since it was to be renovated. It took me about 20 minutes to find the entrance. I arrived late at time and a sign with a red background and red lettering was not a good thing. When you add in poor lighting, it definitely was not a good mix. When I checked in there were a few peopled in the lobby and outside. this raised safety concerns. I obtain my keys and receive directions to my room. Again, more people hanging outside. I enter the room and realized the mistake I made. The room was very small with no iron, ironing board or coffeemaker (most hotels provide these basic items). I read the booklet and I learned to enjoy these benefits, I would have to upgrade which I began to think it wouldn't be worth it. The next morning I left the room and there was woman sitting outside in a lawn chair. I returned 3 hours later and she was still there. If it couldn't get worse, when I returned later that night, two men were sitting outside a room, in lounge chairs, music playing and a small grill on the grass. At this point I was relieved that I was leaving in the morning and this would be a distant memory very quickly."
"6797",4,"The outside of the hotel is not the most inviting. However, the rooms were very clean and the staff was very helpful. Other reviews say this hotel is not in the best area. No area of Atlantic City is really considered a great area in my opinion so don't let that dissuade you from staying at this hotel."
"6798",2,"I stayed here for one night. I was not able to check in right at 3 pm so I had to leave and come back. The young lady at the front desk was pleasant enough. The room was decent, although the bath towels smelled like cigarette smoke. I did see the cleaning staff outside the rooms with their carts smoking cigarettes. At times some of the guest were a bit loud and you could here them, but it didn't bother me enough to complain. The location was good for where I needed to go. Ok place to stay for a night OR 2 but I wouldnt do more than that."
"6799",5,"Very nice property. Room was clean and nicely decorated. Only thing that could be changed is to have handicap spaces by all entrances"
"6800",4,"The lobby was under construction on our visit (May 2012) and this made it very difficult to get around the hotel. Otherwise, it was great."
"6801",3,"The rooms were clean, servers and front desk very courteous. A little expensive at 105++ a night but not bad. Rooms were older - carpets worn. Breakfast decent but not all that good. I would certainly come back (and recommend) as it had comfy beds, working AC and very nice staff."
"6802",5,"Hotel was great! breakfast was good and the staff we're very nice"
"6803",3,"My wife and I rode our motorcycles thru a summer storm from Indiana to this hotel. Needless to say, once we arrived, we were tired, wet, and ready to get into a room.

"6805",4,"Bad: Staff double charged me, did not honor Booking.com rate. We spent 20 minutes at front desk sorting this out !!!. Good: Was clean. Good mattress. Spacious room"
"6806",4,"My family and I stayed here for 4 nights during our 2016 spring break. The location is great, and the hotel is very inviting. Will be staying here again next time. I only wish they had multi room suites for larger families."
"6807",2,"the lobby must be the first place they renovated and it looks great but I stayed on 6 floor and everything in it was old and smelled weird, elevator squeaked all the way up not a great feeling, beds were comfy but I prefer queens"
"6808",5,"I was beside the steps and people was up and down those stairs all night and early in the morning. I really didn't get my proper rest that I needed. And they were so loud."
"6809",5,"Exceptional stay. Was only 1 night, but nice little hidden gem here. It's actually condo setup that requires lock box code from office. Easy check in, fully kitchen was very nice pool awesome. Very nice stay overall!"
"6810",5,"Good: Excellent location, clean interior, very good staff. Easy check in/out. Free parking where the nearby hotels charge for parking even if you stay there."
"6811",5,"Stayed at the Westin for 2 nights. Staff is amazing. Location is amazing! Pebbles at the bar is super helpful and sweet!! Very knowledgeable and friendly! If I'm in the gas lamp area again I will definitely just go in and have a drink if Pebbles is working!!"
"6812",5,"I will be returning the service was excellent"
"6813",5,"Booked a room at the last minute - sight unseen. How refreshing to see a hotel in a nice setting, but close to Route 93 and Boston. The front desk personnel, condition of the room and, can you belive it - a hotel breakfast was over the top. This is my first choice for hotels north of Boston."
"6814",4,"The hotel was surprisingly good. Our room was very clean and spacious for 2 people. The bed was extremely comfortable. I especially liked the pillows that they provided. It gave just the right amount of support to my neck to relieve the stress and fatigue after roaming in scorching Washington DC heat on 4th July weekend (100 F). Hotel staff was super helpful. As soon as we checked into our room, within half an hour hotel attendant provided couple of extra towels without requesting. I especially liked this nice gesture because anyone tired of traveling in hot weather will take a nice bath and would need extra towels for early morning next day. Breakfast was average in terms of variety and quality. Neighborhood is definitely not good. There are couple of police cars always in the Hotel campus. So walking to Metro station is out of question. I wish the free hotel shuttle frequency to metro station was like every 10 mins instead of half an hour. It hardly takes 2 mins by shuttle to reach the metro station. But if you miss it (we did miss by couple of mins, while waiting for the elevator to arrive), you have to wait half an hour for next shuttle. All in all it was nice experience. I would definitely stay again."
"6815",4,"Very nice boutique hotel in downtown Long Beach simple, Euro-style. easy walking distance to Pine Ave and other downtown amenities, easy parking, very nice, simple continental breakfast. I really enjoyed my stay and will be back."
"6816",5,"Good: Staff was great, room small but clean and organized well. Location to TD Garden and restaurants awesome."
"6817",3,"Although the employees were very nice and friendly, and the hotel was clean, I cannot give it more stars because the rooms were tiny and the beds were the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on. Blankets were also thin. Continental breakfast was adequate."
"6818",5,"Overall, the quality of my 3 day stay was good. The room and bathroom were clean, the bed was comfortable, the noise level was low, and the staff were polite and helpful. The workout room is adequate. The breakfast was descent and the hotel is conveniently located. Would stay there again!"
"6819",5,"Good: A fun place to stay with great staff and lots going on in and around the hotel."
"6820",4,"Bad: The room lacked a traditional desk and desk chair. This made it uncomfortable to use a computer. Good: Breakfast served on each floor"
"6821",5,"Bad: Shower Tub clogged. Good: Convenient location. Reasonable food prices. Awesome selection of cuisine. Helpful staff!"
"6822",4,"Good: Location and comfort"
"6823",4,"I always enjoy my stay at this hotel. It's like my home away from home. If there is ever any issues they will do their best to correct it as soon as possible. The rooms are great and the beds are so comfortable.Thank you for choosing the Best Western Plus in Portage 773tabathae and the great comment. We look forward to seeing you again very soon!"

"6827",1,"My husband and I had to stay at this hotel for one night. I have never been to such a terrible place. I have been to the 3rd world countries, but have not seen such a shabby room. The room was disgusting (although the sheets seemed clean). The furniture had spots, tear, and looked like it was picked up off the curb. Nightstands and table had cigarette burns on them. The most terrible thing was that the room reeked of nicotine! I had a hard time sleeping because of the smell. When I got home I had to wash all my clothes. No one should stay in this hotel, unless for punishment! This hotel is a 4-floor building and the elevator is not working, which seems permanent. There is is no phone in the room, so if we had a problem, we needed to go downstairs and then back up."
"6828",5,"Great dining, great amenities, comfy room I was super happy with my experience and I'll definitely be back, if not for personal travel then definitely for work events. Very much looking forward to returning."

"6832",4,"The hotel is in very good condition, with a nearly completed renovation. Pool was nice. Breakfast was good. Miscue was that my room was assigned to another guest while assigned to me! Keys were made and given to this other guest. I was in the room when the other guest came to the room to move in."
"6833",5,"My family and I were overly pleased with the staff especially housekeeping. Traveling with a 4 and 1 year old can be challenging and the staff assisted with a couple bumps in our trip and made us fell welcomed. Hope to return next year to run the marathon again."
"6834",5,"Checking in was kind of slow the day I arrived, but the staff was friendly and the rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good and the staff was keeping the breakfast items well stocked. Will certainly stay here again next time I'm in the area."
"6835",3,"Older motel but in nice shape. Good location close to the dam. Room was a little dark with the older wood paneling. Breakfast was good with plenty of food. Staff was helpful and nice. Parking was a little tight in front. Looked most of the people staying there were there to go fishing."
"6836",5,"Hotel was most accommodating for the time we spent in St. Louis. I would highly recommend the Hampton for anyone planning a medical or leisure stay in St. Louis. Only minutes from everywhere we needed to be, especially the local restaurants on the Hill."
"6837",3,"We were recommended to this hotel by family members, I did not ask to much questions about the place and decided to make a reservation for a couple of days. I must say location is perfect is about a 10 minute walk from the margarita ville resort. You can walk to several restaurants in the area. The jewel of this... More"
"6838",3,"The beds were hard. Too few outlets. Overall a good place to stay."
"6839",1,"I was please to see how close the hotel was to Kings Dominion (across the street) and a Denny's right next door. The good points ended there, however. Upon entering the room, we noticed lots of white hairs on the floor, so we requested that the floor be vacuumed. I requested a rollaway and we started to set it up after we came back from the amusement park. When I opened it, I found a blood stain on the mattress cover. The front desk was alarmed by the finding, but suggested we cover it with sheets (really). I had them take it away, so my little cousin ended up sleeping in the chair. Much later that night, the toilet was stopped up, but maintenance was to busy to fix it, so a plunger was delivered for us to do it. The toilet kept running the entire night. The following morning the toilet overflowed, so we weren't able to shower and we checked out. Each incident was reported to the front desk and we received a 20 discount, which was unsatisfactory given all of the issues encountered. Hotels.com helped to resolve the issue. Thank you Hotels.com! I would never stay at this location again. I would rather drive a few more miles to get the amusement park, than have the convenience of being close yet sacrifice great service."
"6840",2,"Bad: The hotel room did not meet expectations. There was shaved hair in the shower (did not belong to us) and the water did not get hot. It took 10 minutes of running the water to even get to a somewhat comfortable temperature. It was requested for our two rooms to be beside each other and that request was unable to be met. Finally, when my child got sick with the flu, they were unwilling to work with me on the two nights I paid for and lost because she was sick. Good: Location and pool"

"6852",5,"Great new and clean hotel. Staff is friendly and location is perfect. The only negative is the valet charge of 32/day. I thought that was excessive. I am not sure what the self park cost is since I arrived after midnight and just wanted to go to sleep once I got there."

"6858",5,"We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great. Gave great recommendations and lots of coupons for stuff on Duval Street.Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn Suites at The Keys Collection for your recent travels to Key West.

"6867",4,"This hotel was perfect for us. We went to DC for a conference but went a few days early to play. The hotel has a shuttle that leaves every hour and takes you to the metro. We got around perfectly from there. The room smelled like it used to be a smoking room and they've been trying to cover it up for a few months but it was livable. The pool was a little creepy and cold at night but that didn't stop us from swimming every night. All in all a great place for the money."
"6868",3,"The hotel staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean. The location is horrible as there isn't anything close in the way of stores or restaurants. If you arrive late you will have extremely limited access for dinning except for the over priced microwave food at the front desk. Breakfast and cocktail hour are a nice touch, but both need to be extended by an hour."

"6891",3,"I seemed like the Hotel is under going renovations. The road in front of the property is under going serious construction. One of the exterior doors to the Hotel never did not open from the outside. The air conditioner in the room was so noisy I did no sleep well the first few nights. The first day the maids failed to clean the room. We had to go to the front desk to get clean towels."
"6892",4,"The hotel may look a little run down at night, but after seeing it during the day it looks fine. I would probably suggest getting a cabin rather than hotel room. We got one of their cabins that was right beside the river. It was very pretty and relaxing. The cabin was nice and I felt comfortable there. This motel... More"

"6894",4,"Embassy Suites are always beautiful, open spaces and comfortable rooms. This one, across the river from the National Mall, didn't disappoint in it's appearance and cleanliness. But I'm confused why the room service policy doesn't include timely pick-up of used dishes. We saw numerous trays of dirty dinner dishes on the hallway floors 12 to 15 hours after delivery. Seems it would be much cleaner and less (potential) bug-attracting to collect those dishes early in the morning, before breakfast is served. This issue seemed tacky to me, its the kind of thing guests shouldn't have an opportunity to observe. Instead, guests can't help but walk past lots of dirty dishes on their way to breakfast. Equally, dining room staff needs to be sufficient to keep the tables clean at the same rate of guest arriving for breakfast...or at least give us a place near the kitchen to bus our own trays! I saw lots of folks trying to find a clean table, while lots of other folks were trying to clean up after themselves. Aside from this issue, the staff bent over backwards for every question, request or incident."
"6895",1,"Very disappointed. First of all, I felt taken advantage of. There are few choices in this town and the management knows it.

"6912",5,"We stayed at Club Quarters in December.We were in town for the weekend to see Wicked.Its a very nice hotel in a great location. We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district.If you're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your roomThe rooms were clean and thats really most important.When we arrived at 1230pm we were able to check in.We were told we could valet park for 36.00 or for 20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street.We opted for the 20.00 option. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!!My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it.Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back.The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time.After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel.We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great.Im glad we stayed here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave."
"6913",5,"This is the quietest, nice friendly hotel I've been in for years. Service is second to none. Clean, clean, clean. Perfect location for access to all Napa wineries. Lots of room, not cramped in as usual in hotels. Staff was so friendly and helpful, gladly helped with any questions. Will go back for sure, price is decent considering the area.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay. We are here to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. We will see you the next time your in the area."
"6914",3,"Very friendly, helpful staff. The facility, however, is somewhat run-down and in need of maintenance. Location and value are a plus but was disappointed in quality of rooms and that the pool was under construction."
"6915",2,"The location of this place is prime. The hotel condition, on average is nice. I found my room fantastic, with a kitchenette and living room. The elevators were old and confusing (only one went to the garage, but you could not call just that one and there were no stairs).Breakfast was average-- the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the waffles/french toast.Some of the staff were kind and helpful, but many didn't seem to care and others seemed new. Maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay. There are two kiosks at the front desk, and a phone between. While I was checking in, the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer, and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days. This was concerning, distracting, and off-putting. This also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her job.One night, we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight. The banging, accompanied by yelling, continued for several minutes. Worried and scared, I called the front desk, but the person who answered didn't seem to care about the situation and at first didn't offer a solution until I asked if there was nothing they could do, and they said they would send somebody up there again. The front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door. By this point, the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour (by her account-- overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door). I'm worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long. What if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency, or had never opened the door Nobody followed up with us regarding this issue, which was disappointing. Had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience, I likely wouldn't be writing this review.Upon checkout, the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference I was attending because my partner was performing the checkout. Overall, I was really let down by my stay here. The rooms are so nice and the location is great. I thought the Hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great, seamless customer experience, but it didn't seem like they cared.Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us. First, I offer my sincere apologies for the poor care shown to you by my team. We are in the process of training several new additions to our staff but this does not excuse the lack of professionalism and lack of interest in resolving your concerns promptly and with care. Please know that I have addressed your concerns with my team so that we can continue to improve our quality of care. If I can be of any additional assistance, please contact me directly."

"6927",5,"This hotel was recently opened 7 months ago and used to be a bank. The room was clean, spotless and very comfortable. I was traveling in business and it was smack bang in the middle of centre city with easy access to everything. There was a TV in the room with loads of channels to keep you occupied. The shower and toilet were very clean. The only thing I'd say is for the shampoo and shower gel provided to be fragranced..that's just my preference.The staff were get polite esp Walter and Troy..thanks boys for making my stay welcoming..it was great to chat with you guys and sorry I didn't get to say goodbye properly. I can't comment on breakfast or food as I didn't have this and I don't drink so cannot comment on the bar.Lastly the vibe was really nice and Noamaan, Now that's a headline! We are shooting for 7 stars but there are rules about what defines star or diamond level. Those ratings are related to amenities instead of service. That's why we love TripAdvisor! It provides real stories about real experiences in hotels. Thanks for sharing yours. We appreciate the 5 star review. I will share the shout outs with Walter and Troy, though I suspect they're watching too...Hope to have you back soon!"

No porter service, despite a somewhat awkward parking/luggage unloading situation that makes checking in/out difficult for handicapped/elderly. Similarly, no parking valet despite awkward parking situation. No dedicated concierge although desk staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. The included breakfast buffet was nice in appearance, but very poor in quality."

We are coming back for their blueberry festival. it is supposed to be HUGE."

"6954",3,"When I opened the door to my room the trash can was on the floor with garbage from it on the floor. There were big cigar or cigarette ashes on one bed and an aluminum beer can on the entertainment center. The room smelled like cigarette smoke. I called down to the front desk and she apologized emphatically and I went down to get another room key. Mind you I was with my family of 4, 2 small kids in tow. The second room was appeared clean however it still smelled like cigarette smoke. The only good thing about this hotel was the beds were comfy and the hot water lasted long enough for my family of four to take showers. continental breakfast was alright, but it was complimentary so, I cant complain. We stayed a total of 6 nights, but only because I had already prepaid. If I had not, we would have moved to another hotel."

"6959",4,"We stayed for two nights at the Maritime Hotel. The location is great, being right across the street from the Chelsea Market with lots of great food. Close to subway station. The lobby is cozy and well appointed with tables, books, long couches and a fireplace blazing all the time. The room was small, but beautiful with wood finishes and a large round window (which opened - a definite plus). I will definitely stay here again."

"6961",3,"The hotel has seen better days. The room was adequate and clean, but nothing to rave about. The indoor pool was very cold despite being heated. My son and I could only stay in for about 20 minutes. We were on the 6th floor and it had a peculiar smell in the hallways that suggested they might be renovating on that floor...it was that chemical smell...of new carpet or glue...not sure. Our room service dishes stayed in the hallway one full day and night after we finished with them.... Overall...probably won't go back, it was just so-so"
"6962",5,"The staff was very professional and courteous. They provided excellent services like the shuttle and gave excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants. They even gave me walking directions on how to get to the restaurants and even offered the shuttle. My room was clean."
"6963",5,"Even before I arrived at Soniat I had an insight into the warm hospitality that was the theme throughout our stay. From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality. Go, you won't regret it.Wow!You have made my day!What a kind and thoughtful review. Thank you so very much for taking the time.It would be a real pleasure to welcome you back."

The staff did not offer to pay for us to room elsewhere etc due to the inconvenience. I would not recommend this facility. It was in disrepair. And as we were standing at the desk, a couple with 3 small children came in with a confirmation email and there reservation had been cancelled, so they had no room at all."
"6974",5,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during our visit to Virginia last year. Check in was easy, front desk staff was friendly and helpful and spot on with their recommended spots to eat.

"6976",5,"We love Drury Inns and were pleased with our stay in Atlanta. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean, and spacious. Breakfast, though crowded this day, was good and well stocked. One employee was even helping people make waffles. We were also pleased that we could park for up to 7 days for free (subject to available space). We only had to fill out a form, which did clearly state that the hotel is not liable for any damages. That seemed fair enough, and we had no problems with our car while it was parked at the hotel for 3 nights. The location was very convenient to the airport (right off I-85) and the free shuttle service brought us right back to the hotel in minutes."

"6979",3,"Needing to watch our budget was what led us to 4 Flags Inn. We did not expect a 4 Star Hotel just wanted an average one for our 6 night stay. We have used 4 Flags twice and would again. Things were not perfect we didnt expect them to be at such a low price but our room was neat... More"

"6981",5,"I enjoyed my stay here. Check in was easy and greeted by friendly desk staff. The room was very clean with modern upgrades. The hotel was busy but did not hear anything from the room. I slept well as it was quiet and the beds were very comfortable. The room was bigger than expected. The location was excellent and easy... More"
"6982",5,"Great location and a very friendly, helpful staff. Immaculate room and hotel with all the amenities one could ask for. The morning breakfast changed its entree every morning and the coffee was delicious and available all day. The housekeeping staff is very thorough and the room was beautiful. I would highly recommend this Hampton Inn to anyone looking for location and an extremely clean and well appointed place to stay at a very affordable price. This will be our go to hotel whenever we visit family in Maryland."
"6983",5,"In town for a convention, we were given a very pleasant room on the top (34th) floor facing the bay. The room was luxurious and very comfortable for our five day stay, which was made more affordable by a convention rate, which included free Wi-Fi. The breakfast, although not cheap, was superb, and the staff was helpful and friendly. The... More"
"6984",4,"The best western plus is located 10 minutes away from downtown Napa. It is located on Soscal Avenue that connects you to many of the top Yelp eateries. The hotel itself is what we have come to expect from the Best Western Brand. Clean and comfortable rooms, but nothing extravagant. There is a short swimming pool (8 yards) and a hot tub with jets. The property was quiet and had ample parking. There is a Denny's around the corner and that didnt bother me like other reviewers. The only trace is that you can smell sausage and pancakes from the parking lot. They do offer a free full breakfast with coffee. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are afraid of the bed and breakfast scene like I am. Thank you for your review and recommendation. Our rewards members receive a free breakfast in the attached Denny's and most of our reviewers rate it above average as a Best Western Breakfast.. We are glad you enjoyed your free breakfast and stay with us and we hope to see you again in the near future."
"6985",3,"In town overnight to attend a funeral. Nice hotel. Staff was very friendly."
"6986",5,"We stopped at the Hampton Inn Kingsland on our way home from Naples, FL (the half way point). The hotel was very clean, beds were extremely comfortable, and breakfast was great the next morning before we hit the road on the final leg of our trip. The Steakhouse across the street was perfect for dinner!!"
"6987",4,"Overall: Great for Solo and business travelers who travel light. Chose to stay at this Hotel one night because I had an event in L.A I had to attend, and I was running a 5k the next morning out in the LBC. First of all the Staff is Amazing!

"6990",3,"did not meet my expectations at all! I've stayed with this chain before and was impressed, but not this time! The eggs on the breakfast buffet were inedible and the staff disorganized and not prepared to deal with a crowd. Our room was not cleaned, ever. I had to call for clean towels. We used the hot tub, which wasn't hot, had weak bubbles and had tile missing. We ordered a movie and although the screen said we would be charged 14.99+tax, we were charged 17.99+tax. A complete ripoff!"

She was efficient, kind, professional and personable. The room was very basic--not posh by any means--but it was clean and had everything I needed including a great bed.... More"
"6996",3,"Bad: There is no longer a casino on the hotel grounds which is unfortunate. Also, the pool is a bit small. You have to battle to find a spot with the lounge chairs at times. Good: The rooms were clean and staff was nice. The parking is free and it is about 1 1/2 blocks from the strip. It is on the north side of the Bally's."

We have already... More"
"6999",5,"My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue. The staff was very accommodating and interesting. The location is centrally located and convenient. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it. If you're looking for something unusual, this is it. Thank you for your kind review and for you loyalty to Marriott.We do appreciate the fact that you gave us the opportunity to surprise you in a positive manner. And we are delighted to hear that we have been able to meet and go beyond your expectations.As a boutique hotel from the Autograph Collection of Marriott, we are proud to differentiate ourselves by our unique concept and design.We hope to have the pleasure to welcome you again in the future."
"7000",1,"Adrianna was ghetto. Jay was trying to be professional in his t-shirt and jeans, even trying to correct my English. I've stayed at this property several times and was pleasantly satisfied. I simply needed a place to sleep, wash, and change for conferences that keep me out of the room more than in. Unfortunately, this session was horrible. I'm currently on the line with customer service seeking resolution. Again, before this stay I've never had these concerns. (Side note: the rate was higher than I've ever paid this time. I would think they customer service would match). Jay told a lie to the customer service agent and said he gave me time to make arrangements. He said he could lie because I lied on his front desk agent I simply shared how she acted.Mu, Thank you for sharing your concerns. Please know the service issues you describe are an exception to our guest commitment, and as such, we apologize.

"7012",4,"Bad: Better return from the slots!!. Good: Bed excellent, pillows good, shower good with strong flow and hot. Very well maintained public spaces with lots of wood panelling. The piece of the Berlin Wall was quite interesting and all at a very good price."
"7013",5,"The service was friendly, helpful and outgoing. The room was clean and beds comfy. Walls a little on the thin side and no mini fridge was our only complaint along with an aggressive shower head. Yes I would return to this hotel. The food was good and the people who worked their were outstanding."

The person at the front desk was very helpful and said that they had one other room available near... More"
"7015",5,"Good: The shower was amazing, I cannot speak highly enough about the shower. I travel regularly and this was the best hotel that I have ever stayed at."
"7016",4,"Was visiting with family in the area. This hotel is convenient to restaurants and museums."
"7017",4,"Nice room, looked to be in the last stages of a renovation. I would stay there again. Charged for a safe but was unable to locate it. There room had hardwood floors which is something new to me in a hotel experience."
"7018",5,"Bad: I think there could be more options offered as breakfast (there were only bagels and donut like something, and fruits), but it was still enough. So it's not something I didn't like but something that can be improved. Good: This hotel was a great one! When we entered room, there was classical music coming from the stereos, which give us a very nice feeling to start with. The bathroom, the towels, the bed, everything was clean, organized. I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most."
"7019",3,"So this isn't the best motel out there but the price is right and if you are just looking for a place to crash for a night it will do. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. You can bring your pets in the room with you. It's close to the freeway and Marie Callendars (which has wonderful breakfasts). Try it out you won't be disappointed."
"7020",4,"Stayed two nights here while attending a sporting event at Centurylink Center. The hotel is an easy drive from downtown, and just a mile from Westroads Mall with shopping and restaurants.

I love this hotel and I will be booking there again on my next trip to Las Vegas. They rooms are big and very clean. This hotel is great for a family trip,so much to see and do."
"7022",3,"We stayed 2 nights at this motel. It was a pretty basic room without a refrigerator or microwave. It was clean and owners were friendly. It appeared that the bathroom had been recently updated. It has a pool and grill area which families used quite often. Rates were fairly reasonably for this time of year in the Old Forge area."

"7026",4,"Needed to stay here due to a family funeral and it was fine. Didn't pay much attention to decor or things like that but it was clean and the staff for the most part were very nice. We stayed a week and had no complaints and considering why we needed to stay there we were grateful."
"7027",5,"Stayed only one night as a walk in. Beautiful clean room, delicious breakfast, super friendly staff. Walked across the street to a grocery store and other shops. This property is a credit to the Hampton brand. Highly recommended."
"7028",5,"Great hotel for the price. Breakfast was delicious. Convenient location to main highways. Would definitely stay here again if I was in the area."
"7029",5,"Pros- Great customer service, comfortable beds, clean rooms, fantastic room style/decor and safe area. Cons- no pool, no meals available, just a few pastry type items at the bar/lobby"
"7030",5,"Bad: It was perfect, period!. Good: What's there not to like The wonderful staff at the Westin even guessed we were getting married in Vegas and, to our total surprise, when we got back to the hotel after our wedding ceremony, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolate-coated strawberries waiting for us. The hotel's restaurant, the Savona Bistro, simply has the best angus burger in the world! The location, for those of us who prefer to skip the hustle and bustle of the Strip: perfect!"
"7031",2,"My family and I stayed here for the weekend to do the Across the Bay 10k events. The hotel is older and the condition shows it. Furniture and carpet show many signs of wear and tear. The pool was not open because it was November. The front desk was very friendly and helpful when we called down or stopped to ask questions. Maid service did an excellent job of cleaning, making the beds, and giving us fresh bath supplies. Breakfast was very yummy with many different options. There is a grocery store, gas station, and place to eat all within walking distance. The neighborhood didn't seem the best at night so we stayed in the room when it got late. The room doors are all on the outside of the building which I really don't care for due to safety. Overall not terrible but you get what you pay for and I was trying to save a few dollars."
"7032",3,"The front staff was friendly and helpful. She was able to accommodate me in a first floor room knowing I had twins and the hotel does not have an elevator. The room looks great. My only problem was that a roach crawled on my phone. After that I questioned the cleanliness of the room."
"7033",4,"The hotel was awesome. We even got to see the Bones, Thugs and Harmony entourage. :P The only downside is that the pool was a little gross and murky. My son didn't care but I wouldn't step foot in there. It was tough to see the bottom. Unfortunately part of my search criteria for a Baltimore hotel was if it had a pool."
"7034",3,"Bathroom needed maintenance to the sink and tub was pealing. Nice furniture and room was nice. Front desk attendant was paying more attention to her phone than the customers. No bottled water available at the concessions. Ice machine broken on 2nd floor. Overall I like this Hotel was just a little disappointed in the services offered."
"7035",4,"Bad: Only 2 elevators, coffee. Good: Breakfast included as well as one drink (5-8 pm), new and well kept, great location"
"7036",5,"The Mills House is centrally located in the middle of everything we wanted to do during our stay. The staff members were the friendlist I have ever met. The rooms were great. The only down side was the pictures posted were true to the appearance of the hotel, but not the rooms. The rooms were a little more modern than pictured, this did not take away from our enjoyment though. We were on the 5th floor and had a great view. I would stay here again on another visit."
"7037",3,"Uneventful and fine except I was told they could Not print invoice for charges,because it was booked through you. Call me and i will give u the name of the employee and you can be sure i have called my credit card company to check on what was posted."
"7038",4,"This hotel is a reasonably good place to stay if you want to visit the Napa Valley. Our room was clean and pleasant, the staff members we encountered were helpful and professional, and the price we paid for our room (during December of 2014) was reasonable. However, potential guests should be aware that, according to information we were given by a staff member, rates may be different during the summer.Thank you for your review. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and the service we provided. Yes the summer rates are higher, but we are still one of the most reasonably price hotels during that time of year. Hope to see you again."

"7040",5,"We were in Key West September 18th thru September 22nd. We were supposed to meet another couple but unfortunately they couldn't make it because Anne- Marie broke her ankle shortly before the trip. So, we got to the Saint Hotel that Sunday after being dropped off by a taxi that we took from the airport. I would have never believed that something so beautiful would be behind the front doors that we entered. Once inside,the place was magnificent! The room, the pool, the bar/restaurant area were all so nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention how friendly and personable the staff was, particularly Gustavo Lobo and Maria. Gustavo was so helpful and friendly. He was so pleasant to be around. He went out of his way to help us, especially when we were at the pool. And Maria, she was so personable and a pleasure to talk to. Both were outstanding people! Wish we could have stayed longer! We mistakenly left a bag of gifts at the hotel when we had already left for home and after calling the hotel to see if we had left it there, it was sent back to our home within five days! Great place, both hotel and island!!!!!!!!!Thank your for this amazing review.Please be sure that I will share this comment with Gustavo Maria. They make us proud everyday by providing a genuinely caring service to our guests.In addition, we are flatted that you truly appreciate the unique decor and saintly vibe of our establishment. And it is true that the Saint is full of surprises and mystery...On the other hand, I am sorry to hear that your trip with us was too short, but note that we will always be pleased to have you here in Key West."
"7041",5,"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly."
"7042",3,"Bad: Dirty and old room. Valet parking is not comfortable. Casino is old and has no roulette. If you have a car, you can stay, cause the price is everything. Good: Pretty cheap for Las Vegas"
"7043",5,"Great place for an extended stay! Enjoy the atmosphere, the staff, and everything around the city there in Port Arthur. Enjoyed the fact that I could use the kitchenette with the room when not wanting to go out to eat all the time when I stayed for a few days. Will definitely stay again when traveling through the area."
"7044",5,"Well this was a surprise find, wonderful location, Marina view to our front and Harbour view to our back, the restaurant and bar were first class, good service and helpful staff.

"7045",4,"Very easy check in. Room was clean and comfortable. Service from all employees was good. The food choices are great. The Italian place (Salvatore's I think ) was amazing. Great food and prices with impeccable service. Highly recommended!"
"7046",2,"First of all, I read these reviews alot and I am always suprised at how picky some people are. We are not that way and are usually looking for something that is a good deal even if it's not the greatest hotel. Having said that, this is my review. Got into the hotel at 11:30 at night after 11 hours of driving to find that the air conditioning in our room did not work. The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again."
"7047",5,"We checked in late (1:15 am) after a Monday night Redskin/Giants game - Hotel was full clerk at desk extremely busy but very accommodating to us. Our room was clean comfortable plus the refrigerator microwave I had requested was there. Breakfast was excellent staff friendly helpful. The clerk at checkout was relaxed friendly despite how extremely busy he was. We will stay here again next time we are in the area."
"7048",5,"Bad: The breakfast could have had more protein options. Good: Loved the room and the location"
"7049",5,"The room was great we had a corner suite with a pano view. The staff were great and the restaurants were amazing. Checking in at the tower suites was fantastic. No line ups and very friendly staff. Overall the Hotel is fantastic. Very easy to navigate throughout the hotel as many casinos are very confusing. Good central location as well."
"7050",5,"My kids and I travel through Harrisburg on our way to see my parents in VA once a year or so. We always stay at this hotel as a stopping point and have never been disappointed.

"7057",4,"Our room was clean, the staff was very pleasant. Not a fancy place but bed was comfortable and the breakfast was ample - fruit, cereal, toast and bagels, juice, waffles. We didn't realize there was a pool - nice to go in and warm up."
"7058",5,"Staff very friendly and check in was fast and efficient. Breakfast was one of the best I have seen at a motel Very clean place all around, from room to breakfast area. Very close to Lambert's Cafe which is a destination restaurant. If you are in this area STAY HERE, you will not be disappointed."
"7059",5,"Good: THE HOTEL NEEDS A BETTER COFFEE SHOP FOR QUICK BREAKFAST. WHAT EXISTS THERE IS ONLY OKAY...IT IS NOT INVITING OR OFFERS MUCH WARMTH."
"7060",5,"Even though Chris and Sheri were out of town during our stay, they made arrangements for my family and I.

"7061",4,"My boyfriend and I stayed here based on the reviews on this site, which I can usually depend on--and again, they were right!The hotel is very nice inside, the location is prime, and the staff is one of the Best we have ever encountered, and I have travelled worldwide. The rooms are smaller, but if you think about it, what is missing is the vast expanse between the side of the bed and the main window, and who uses that Anyway!Great things that made up for the smaller size (and my boyfriend is 6'2 and had No problem with the hotel at all!)are the small kitchenette, with coffee maker and supplies for morning java, the bathroom and it's nice shower, and the bed was very comfortable! Ask for a room higher up and enjoy the great view! We were not disturbed by any noises, nor elevator troubles, in the least. There is also a nice desk in the room, for your laptop. Once more, the staff here will do everything in their power to make your stay wonderful!We Will be going back ,and we will be staying at CQ! There is also a small cafe in front of the hotel that had a very good breakfast, and looked busy at night with casual cocktails and Italian food that looked great.Remember that you are not moving in for good, and once you get in the room, you will find you have all the space you need!"
"7062",5,"My stay at Comfort Suites was very relaxing. They have every amenity that you could think of. They had an excellent hot breakfast every morning, a heated pool, and a fitness room. I would recommend this hotel to anyone because they are very understanding of your wants and needs. They will try their best to get you what you need."

There was supposed to be a stream outside the back door of our room but very little water was trickling through it. We did have a fireplace and where our room was situated was very quiet. No guests above or... More"
"7069",5,"Bad: Breakfast pretty modest but I could leave with that!. Good: Excellent location next to attractions, commercial area, everything. Friendly and helpful staff. The room was not big but well equipped. Good price for Boston which is an expensive city."
"7070",5,"Friendly staff, clean comfortable room... Convenient location offering easy access to highway... The early morning breakfast was a nice pitstop before heading over to the hospital. I will make it a point to stay here again the next time I'm in town...."
"7071",5,"Very clean, relatively new hotel. Flat-screen tv's in rooms and great restaurant on ground level. Highly recommended for business travelers. If you are looking to really enjoy Baltimore and relax, this may not be the hotel for you. You will end up spending a lot of for cab rides."
"7072",4,"Bad: no finger food during happy hour. Good: Great Breakfast"
"7073",3,"The only thing about the Red Roof inn is its in the corner and it's tucked away from everything... so for me who didn't have a vehicle it's kind of difficult navigate to like the store and things like that I mean, but there are few places within walking distance..."
"7074",4,"This hotel was located right off the interstate. Signage at the hotel was not visible until after you passed it. The hotel staff was very polite and accommodating. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The only complaint I had was that it was a handicap room so everything was set very low. Overall, our stay was very nice and we were surprised with the size of our suite."
"7075",5,"We stayed here as a perfect halfway stop on our way to and from a ski trip to Park City, Utah. You enter into a lovely lobby. Our room was not only spacious, but had one of the largest bathrooms I've seen with private toilet and separate tub and shower. The free drinks, and if you arrive early, good snacks... More"
"7076",4,"Visited Charleston with friends for a quick getaway. Once you reach the Indigo and park your car, you can walk anywhere in the historic area. Located near the market, restaurants, museums, carriage tours. We had a great time. The Indigo is a historic building, and is well cared for. Rooms are small but well appointed and arranged(and clean!), breakfast is... More"
"7077",2,"The staff was not at the desk and when they finally came out ignored me and took another person in front of me. When it was time to check out they couldn't print me a receipt and said they would email me but never did."
"7078",4,"Loved the location of this hotel so much! We could walk everywhere. Also, the room was a little outdated and the beds were a little small, but the bathroom was new and updated. For a weekend getaway, it was perfect for 4 people. The service was outstanding especially from Beau, I believe that was his name, who worked at the... More"
"7079",2,"I expect VERY little from a hotel. I'm cheap by nature, and I really only want a door that locks and a shower that's hot. However, Hotel 502 made me rethink my low expectations and future travel plans. The front desk clerks ARE friendly and responsive, BUT, the rooms are very shabby and barely clean ('down there' hair on toilet seat, permanent mystery stain on sheets), the shower was cold/lukewarm (at best) and the neighborhood is less than desirable--LOTS of transients and sketchy folks wandering on property. I only paid 62 (+tax) per night, but if I had paid more I would have been really angry. As I said earlier, I really only want a locking door and hot shower (for 60+ I don't expect much). I can overlook the worn down rooms (I was told our room was renovated, but my mother stayed here when it was formally the Red Roof Inn, and said it looked the same, save a new t.v., and a different paint color on the bathroom wall). I can overlook the fact that a storm knocked out their WiFi and the pool was closed. I can overlook the people passed out drunk in their cars, and the less than clean room/bath. But NO hot shower Not good--even for 62 and some change. The only plus was the friendly front desk clerk--she gets kudos."
"7080",4,"Good: Location. Peace and quiet. Breakfast good, nice bar."
"7081",3,"Having travelled over the past 6 months, this hotel for a 3 star location was very disappointing. First the decor is very old, dark, and non-inviting. Secondly, the Ramada is advertised in the Arundel Mills area, plenty of restaurants to choose from. However, on your way from the airport to the hotel, you realize that you are as far removed from as possible from anything nearby. They offer transportation to the Mall ( approx 4mi track) for 10.00. Obviously not customer-friendly. They infer that the transportation is to be free. Also, upon arrival in your room you discover there is no clock radio of any kind, there is no booklet to explain the amenities of the hotel or nearby attractions. When asking the front desk if if the booklet might have been taken, they sheepishly responded Wedon't have anything like that. The continental breakfast was ok noting that rarely was anyone from the staff keeping the items replenished or the juice containers from being completely out. After a 20 min return the orange juice was still out at 7:45 AM. Because of the lack of additional restaurant convenience I did eat at the hotel. The food was decent, but nothing to rave on and the cost was a little above average. Service at the restaurant was fair not because the servers weren't trying, tbut because there are only two servers period and one helps at the bar. Finally, there are no internet instructions posted in the room."
"7082",5,"I have stayed here for a month the last two winters Iloved it.the staff is very friendly and helpful I had a refrigerator problem it was addressed immediately rooms are nice rates reasonable million dollar view and great location I will return again"
"7083",1,"Staff was rude, hotel is dirty, no hot water, questionable neighborhood. Was one of the worst hotels I have visited. The low rate is not low enough. Would not recommend under any circumstance. Pay the extra fifty dollars a night and stay at the Courtyard."
"7084",4,"Overall, this was a nice hotel in a convenient location. The room was clean and comfortable. It is a little expensive considering parking, Wifi, and breakfast aren't even included. We didn't have time to check out any of the restaurants or amenities. We enjoyed our stay."
"7085",4,"We stayed 2 nights on a last minute getaway. Friendly staff, clean, oceanfront room, nice clean pool and pool area. We arrived around noon, without reservations and they let us check in. Great price. Will definitely recommend and stay there again."
"7086",5,"We recently traveled to Northern Vermont for the first time. On the recommendation of a friend, we stayed at the Grey Gables Mansion. Tim and Debbie were fantastic hosts. The room was comfortable and clean, the breakfasts were the best, and it nice to be welcomed guests. Tim and Debbie gave us ideas for local dining, ways t best see... More"
"7087",5,"I've stayed at numerous hotels over the past year and this room was by far the best. The room came with sofa and office space in addition to the king size bed. Surely I will stay there again."
"7088",5,"The front desk was most accommodating and welcoming. Maddie (if I remember correctly) was top-notch in giving us directions, answering questions, and overall just making us feel welcome after a long drive."
"7089",4,"Bad: The breakfast is nothing special. Parking is 30 per each 24Hrs."
"7090",5,"Great place to stay.....for such a great rate I did not think that the hotel would be very nice...but, I was wrong it was very nice. It was clean, quiet and the beds were the most comfortable I have experienced at a hotel."
"7091",5,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staff was very helpful, grounds were clean, we really enjoyed the fire pits, the breakfast, and our whole experience. It was easy to get down to the beach, you can even walk to local restaurants on the beach."
"7092",2,"Bad: The property tries so hard to be trendy that it actually made it very difficult to stay as a family. There was only one pillow each, three towels for four people and a tightly restricted supply of coffee- only two, environmentally unfriendly, pods. The oddest part was there were no teaspoons, only stirrers and amazingly no kettle- and only two mugs for four people. We had to bother house keeping just to bring a kettle up to make tea (also not supplied). This hotel sells trendy box water for 8 which pretty much sums up how far off the mark this place is with practicalities. Trendy sure, but practical and sensible...no. Reminded me of of a start up thats well funded but just silly. Also the rooms air conditioning setting included jet engine or off so that was extremely uncomfortable. I wouldnt stay here again given they also have an odd naughty drawer and I needed to explain to my 7 year old what sex dust was. Extremely odd place to stay as a family. Good: I liked that the lobby was filled with fun games and a great bar which was very relaxed and welcoming."
"7093",4,"I stayed here for 7 nights as I was going to Disneyland. I have to say firstly, the location was PERFECT.

"7097",4,"Excellent staff provides great service at a reasonable price. Rooms were clean quiet. Breakfast items were plentiful fresh. The requirement for a minimum of 200 characters for a review is annoying."
"7098",5,"The staff made it a very enjoyable stay. After check in the front desk clerk made fresh cookies and lemonade. The rooms were very clean and fresh smelling. The breakfast was very good and fresh. Will stay on our return trip."
"7099",5,"Bad: We loved everything, however they could have had longer breakfast times. Good: The bed was super comfy, the rooms were relatively soundproof - we could only hear when people walked by with large bags, the cleaning staff were great, 24/7 reception - very friendly, helpful. Pool was always clean and heated."
"7100",5,"Great place to stay. Staff were friendly, new me buns me. Excellent breakfast. Rooms super clean. Wifi is lacking, my phone worked better on its own data vs. the hotel Internet. Will definitely stay there again."

"7104",4,"I stayed here for AmericasMart was excited about the fresh paint cleanliness of my room. However, between the hours of 2-5 the front desk staff were incredibly noisy EVERY day (I was here for a week). It was very frustrating. It is more expensive for a Motel 6, but again, the location is great."
"7105",3,"I stayed for a night while my apartment was being renovated but as things took longer i have been there for a week. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are not 5 star but they are very nice(clean,affordable and quiet). I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone local or in town for a few days."

"7109",1,"We did not like this hotel. We left after one night. It was January in DC, (cold) and the heater did not work in the room. We called the person at the front desk but there was no one available to help with this. We called the front desk again for extra blankets which they did bring. We had booked a room with two beds and were very specific about this when calling for the reservation. When we got to the hotel there was only one bed in the room and no one could help us as the front desk was closed, only someone there to had out keys for late arrivals."

"7115",2,"Room smelled waited 45mins for shuttle"
"7116",2,"The hotel was clean, and in good repair for the most part. The internet was sketchy, and did not work for the first night. The availability of wireless being the reason I choose this hotel, this was quite bothersome. It is kind of a ride to DC, though not terrible. The shuttle service picking us up from the train was late despite numerous calls. Some of the customer service was better than others, just depends who you talk to. The surrounding area leaves something to be desired. In the end, it was not terrible, but it was not great either."
"7117",4,"My fiance and I came here to celebrate our engagement (he proposed on the trip). We absolutely loved the room.

"7120",5,"We couldn't have made a better choice. The Westin was the full package and provided more than we could have hoped for. Many thanks goes to Sarah Locke for doing such an amazing job with the planning and time that went into our wedding reception. We highly recommend!"
"7121",4,"I was traveling for work during the spring training season. The price was right at this hotel. The room was comfortable but the surrounding area was not very nice."
"7122",5,"Bad: A little bit of noise from the 'L' down below, but then again that is part of the character of the city. Good: Overall cleanliness, new feel, friendly efficient staff, great happy hour! Excellent location."
"7123",4,"Nothing spectacular. Good hotel. Kinda in the middle of stateline and actual SLT so walking seems kinda a pain. I thought they had redone the pool building entirely, but it was just a new facade. The rooms look bad, the best was uncomfortable, the wifi was inconvenient, the outlets only half worked."
"7124",5,"We stay here everytime we're in town for the Supercross and it's a really nice place to stay! The room is really clean and the beds are really comfortable. We'll definitely continue staying here when in town."
"7125",5,"A great location for beautiful sunsets, great food close by, and whale watching! We really enjoyed our stay."
"7126",5,"Large rooms, good beds and great price. Staff was very helpful and the area was safe. It was quite considering it is along a major road. About 2 miles form downtown area so you will have to drive to get there."
"7127",4,"We pulled in for the night on a long trip. Bed was good! Towels a touch rough. The road noise was loud! We have a 'wind machine' on our phone, so we managed, but lots of trucks, lots of traffic. Would ask for the back side if we stayed here again. Very clean and very pleasant front desk."

"7129",4,"We were in the area for a Cody Jinks concert (he's wonderful is you've never heard of him) and the location was perfect. It is located downtown on Fannin, so also a good location for anyone that might be in Houston for one of the hospitals. Hotel was also very aesthetically pleasing so kudos to whoever is in charge of decor. Rooms were small but other than that I have no complaints. Good bang for your buck and customer service was wonderful!"
"7130",4,"Small hotel which made it nice. Not a lot of people all over the place. Rooms very clean and spacious with balconies in every room. Every room had beach view. Not on the beach, it's separated by the boardwalk. In which you come out of your room and you are right there with all the activities and restaurants. Very nice night life, and the beach is still right there. I do recommend this Hotel"
"7131",2,"Nice property and rooms but the service was awful. Hard to get attention from front desk. Multiple requests needed to get issues resolved. It's a big hotel but doesn't have the customer service needed."
"7132",5,"Just traveling through and needed a place to sleep. We could not have found a better place. Wonderful staff, what was left. Due to Memorial Weekend they have the housekeeping staff off on that Monday! What a great gesture! Clean, comfortable bed, nice pool and connected to Perkins where received a complementary breakfast. The only negative was we could hear other guest talking when we were in the bathroom and other noises from our room. Easy on and off I 94. 10 day road trip and this was one of the best."

Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"7138",2,"There was a lot of miscommunication between me and the hotel pickup service. I used the metro the entire time I visited D.C. When I would get back I would have to be picked up at the Franconia-Springfield station or else it would take the driver over an hour to come pick me up, even if it was near the hotel. Additionally, there was not shuttle to Reagan National Airport. I had a flight to catch at 6:00 AM so the metro was out of the question, since it doesn't run until 5:00 AM. The hotel couldn't do because it was too far away. They were promoting a taxi service that was going to charge 40 to get to DCA. I was not impressed with this taxi service when I needed a ride from near the Hilton Hotel to Best Western (this cabbie thought New Mexico wasn't part of the U.S.). So I did use Uber to get to DCA."

It was a pleasant stay, the workers at the desk were very helpful on telling how to get around town on the public transit system and were very kind. Breakfast is solid and there's plenty of room to eat. If we go back to Oregon, we'd consider staying here. Wish the Max went a little farther south closer to it, but that's not the hotel's fault."

Great value for money. I thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.Dear azelinaf2017,Thank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers.

"7150",4,"Bad: The bed was stiff and valet parking only. Wifi is pay only and didn't live up to the speed expectations as advertised.

"7157",4,"Wasn't expecting much from this hotel due to the low rate, however the staff was very organized. I called earlier in the day to let them know I would not be arriving until 11pm. The front desk staff had my key and paperwork sitting out when I arrived. I was in the room in a few minutes.The room itself, had a real king size comfortable bed in it. The room was decorated well. The bathroom was neat, a shower with just a glass wall.The restaurant and bar were very nice, although I only went to the free continental breakfast.The hotel looks like it was updated within 10 years, but then has had alot of use.Only room issues were the shower and bathroom drywall had taking a beating with the lack of a shower curtain, it should be fixed. Looks like the maintenance staff just threw some spackle and painted over the water damage.My room faced the highway, so it was rather loud all night, however the AC was loud enough to drown out the noise. If you stay more than one night I would suggest getting a room facing the other way. The TV only has basic channels, no HBO or Showtime."
"7158",5,"Good: The comfort in the bedroom was excellent, good blankets, soft pillows, a bathroom really clean, the staff was really nice."
"7159",3,"Not only did the shower for my room not have hot water (so they gave me another room but still it was inconvenient when I was rushing to catch a train), but the new room they assigned me to had extremely hot water running in the toilet! (I could tell by the steam and intense heat coming from the toilet after flushing). The hotel definitely has been very well refurbished and the condition of everything is of high quality, EXCEPT that it doesn't seem they've worked out all of their plumbing details yet."
"7160",3,"You get what you pay for...while the rate was good (I stayed from Sunday July 10th to Sunday July 17th for 502), some of the people greeted you and some didn't greet you. The outlets in the room barely worked. The mirror behind the bed is a little weird unless your into that type of thing. The continental breakfast was extremely bare, so I ended up eating out, unless you like only bread and waffles then your golden..the pool is extremely small..the location is great because you can walk the strip and everything is around that area but you have to deal with the traffic. All in all for the price it was ok, I am not going to be praising the hotel's name anytime soon..I have stayed in Motel 6 and Red Roof Inn with better service than this hotel...save up for a better hotel"

"7165",4,"We spent 3 nights at the Four Points. It was well worth the money. Very convenient to the metro which we took the 2 full days that we went into Washington D.C. The hotel will take you and pick you up from the metro with their shuttle. The neighborhood is not the greatest, but I felt safe. There are several surrounding business like an Ihop, pizza place, and 7-11. A New Carrollton officer sat in the 7-11 parking lot 2 of the nights we were there. I would definitely recommended Four Points."

"7167",4,"We stayed here for 3 nights in September. We arrived early and in a bit of a rush to get ready for a wedding. The hotel staff was very helpful in getting our room ready early for us. It's always nice when a hotel goes a little extra to help out, great customer service! We stayed in a standard king size room, which was spacious with a couch/sitting area.The room was quiet, we never really heard any noise from outside or from neighbors. There isn't a breakfast option, but there is a Denny's attached to the hotel and they give you 6 off per person coupons to use each day.We went to wineries in St. Helena and Oakville, the travel times varied between 20-30 mins. We ate dinner in Napa and it was just a few minutes drive to plenty of places. Overall, based on the location, price and customer service, I would recommend this hotel.Jdiddy78 - Thank you for such a kind review. We strive on incredible customer service and do everything we can to make sure you are satisfied with your stay. I'm glad we could get you into your room early to get ready for the wedding you were attending and we hope next time you're in our area you will come and stay with us again.

"7202",4,"Visited D.C. for two days and found this to be gret for what we needed. Close to the metro and shuttle service to and from. Breakfast was ok...not that much variety but for the price adequate. Only issue we had was with the shuttle one evening we got in about two minutes after the scheduled shuttle from metro to hotel and they would not wait for us. I think a small exception could have been made to wait a minute or two at 10 pm to wait for a guest that was on the phone with you telling you that they were one stop away. Front desk just said sorry we cant wait..next shuttle will be in 30 minutes. We took a taxi and although its probably only a quarter of a mile drive it cost ten dollars. I have mixed feelings about how that situation was handled being in customer service but I can also understand that there has to be structure as well. Overall a good place to stay.. I would recommend it to friends."

Ryan the Guest services person who checked us in set the tone for the rest of the stay. He was extremely courteous and helpful with all our requests, offered us advice on transportation and dining in the area which was great. We ate at the Quarter Deck restaurant he recommended all three days we were there for lunch it was so good. Cant say enough good things about the Virginian Suites!!! If your looking for a nice clean place close to everything at about half the price of the hotels downtown, you have to stay at the Virginian Suites. Cant wait to go back."
"7206",4,"We love to stay at W Hotels when we travel. This was a business trip and the stay was pleasant. The room was more than adequate. We were disappointed that there were NO drawers in the furniture in the room, so we had to improvise and stack things on the desk. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant.

"7217",5,"The motel was 10 min fro the metro station. It was very convenient. A safeway was about 2 blocks away, (don't go to the Prospect Market--very expensive) The room was large enough for all six of us, the kitchen was adequate and saved us a lot of money. It was good we booked through hotels.com becasue we heard a few other customers fighting with the staff over their bill. When we checked out they said we were all paid and there was our reciept. The workout room was nice, the bathroom near the workout room hadn't been remodeled yet. There is internet but it didn't work very fast, they said they were updating it. No pay for view movies, but a nice big flat screened tv. Overall I would stay there again, loved the location and the fact it had a kitchen"
"7218",5,"Once we finally found it we enjoyed the stay. Your sign is hidden behind Applebees and we couldn't find it without stopping and asking for directions.

"7229",5,"I have stayed at this property for all most 10 years and the consistent level of service has never faulted. From the Manager Phillip to the House Keeping crew, front desk personnel, the kitchen staff and even engineering, they all are friendly and intent on making your stay a positive experience."
"7230",1,"There weren't enough towels and washcloths placed in the room before our arrival. When I asked for two more, they only had one washcloth the other washcloths and towels had yet to be washed.

"7261",4,"Great place to stay with the kids! It has a nice pool, an indoor play area, and an arcade. The breakfast is what you would expect from other hotels not overly fancy. The hotel itself is a little run down but not particularly dirty. Most of the staff is very helpful. We booked two rooms and were upgraded to two huge three bed suites with two bathrooms so there was plenty of room for my family of five. We would stay again."

This is a nicer hotel, and we just felt like since we don't always dress fancy - after all, we were on vacation and out and about all day, every day - that we were looked down upon. We aren't fancy people but wanted to spoil ourselves for our anniversary. Good: We loved the location and the style of the hotel and the rooms. Caesar at the door was extremely welcoming and helpful."

Seemed like they hated their job. They also take 100 out for a security deposit. They said I'll get it back within 17 business days. The location is sketchy. Do not walk at night. Really nothing to do around that area unless you have a car or hoping onto the Metro."

Another fine compliment to the Marriott franchise...It is located next to the Interstate highway, so some trucks could be heard, so I suggest calling ahead when you reserve and ask for a room on a lower floor next to...

"7268",1,"Horrible. Never stay here. I would not have stayed if it wasn't non-refundable. Burn holes in the blankets, stains and tears all over the chair that was in the room to sit in, and I even slept in my clothes on top of the covers. Seriously disgusting. Never again."
"7269",5,"This was the last stop on our marathon trip home from South Florida. Check in was a breeze and there were plentiful luggage carts to bring in our belongings.

Location was good for the boys to walk to fast food away from trafficWe are very happy to hear that our location was ideal for your team. We appreciate your business and hope to host your team again in the future."
"7273",5,"Felt like home. Would definitely stay here again. Great free breakfast! Very comfortable suites."

"7277",4,"Bad: Construction at hotel, but obviously it has to be done at sometime or another. Realize that was just just bad luck on out part. Thought the price for the hotel was a little high. Good: Nice staff, Luisa from Potugal could have not been nicer."

"7280",5,"I stayed at the hotel while attending the Harvard LEV program. The room was luxurious, spacious and had all the comforts needed for this busy week. Wifi was a little inconsistent, but not too challenging. I would definitely stay again the next time I'm in Cambridge."
"7281",4,"I would have given this hotel 5 stars except my TV and internet went out during a heavy rain storm. The staff was pleasant and when my double room wasn't ready they upgraded my to a king."
"7282",4,"Great location the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, especially William. The rooms are clean, quiet, and the beds are super comfy.

"7283",3,"Given the location of the hotel, it wasn't a bad stay. I know the name on the outside has changed a few times but the interior hasn't changed much at all.. The over night desk clerk mumbles when he speaks making my late night check-in that much more agonising. The maintenance housekeeping crew were overly polite and courteous, loved it. The front desk clerk and manager both over night and day shifts need to take a page from their fellow employees book on manners."

Vina GM."
"7286",4,"Great location to the beach and boardwalk. Nice to have a kitchen. Would have liked to have stayed for a few more days. Try to get an inside room. Though we did have a slice of the ocean view, the lights of the business on the other side of the alley was on all night."
"7287",5,"I highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay. It's situated in Arlington a quieter,more idealic area than Washington dc itself although still very easy to visit all the attractions in DC via a short walk to Rosslyn, it's nearest metro.Hotel room was amazing value for money,very clean with a separate kitchen area.There is no hotel restaurant available and thekitchen was more than adequate to cook decent meals in. Our only complaint is that our gas cooker did not work and after mentioning it to the hotel it was never sorted out so we spent 2 weeks without a working cooker.As there is not much in the surrounding area we found ourselves having to travel into rosslyn and Washington to buy dinner."
"7288",5,"This is a newer hotel and very clean. My room 312 was very quiet and clean. No elevator noise or ice machine noise. The layout of the rooms are very user friendly with modern decor. Mattress was very comfortable. Great hotel for the price."

It was a pleasure having the two of you stay with us and getting to chat Pearl Jam and old Seattle rock. It would be great to see you two down from BC again soon!Cheers until then,David Bayley"
"7293",3,"I thought it would be nicer than best western or comfort inn, since it's by Sheraton but it's not. The room size is about the same, I got double beds. There's no free breakfast. There's not much establishment around the area. Better go to downtown San Jose. It's still a nice clean hotel with comfy bed and pillows. I'd still recommend it because it's affordable. Maybe I expected too much."
"7294",2,"If I knew how far away and the sketchy neighborhood this hotel was, I never would have stayed there. There is nothing but fast food in the area and walking after dark is questionable. The room smelled of cleaning chemicals, the wireless service was weak, and maintenance did not come when called. No hairdryer - had to call the desk for one. Toilet paper holder falling off wall. They did a good job making this hotel look good in the pictures, but it was run-down. The van did come when they said it would, but be prepared to wait a long half-hour if you miss it."
"7295",4,"Hotel was pretty good. Really my only complaint would be that the bed wasn't comfortable, but I know it's hit or miss since everyone likes different kinds."

"7297",5,"My wife and I were hoping for clean and found it to be extremely well kept. The gentleman that checked us in was very friendly as well. Located in a great location to visit the local bars and restaurants. We would stay again."
"7298",5,"This a super nice Hampton. The desk staff is friendly, the breakfast was delicious. Our room was spotless. The beds are super comfortable. We had a river view room with a balcony. It was nice to be able to relax on the balcony.We had an issue with the thermostat and maintenance came up promptly--turns out it was operator error! Asked for extra towels one evening and they were brought up immediately. On Tuesdays and Saturdays there is a nice Farmer's Market just a few yards away (I believe it closes in October until next season). A grocery store within walking distance. We definitely recommend!Dear PeggyS513,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback, as well all the great things you mentioned about our friendly staff and comfortable beds. Our balcony rooms do have a different thermostat unit than the others and typically we do get calls about them not operating. Unfortunately you do need to be within so many feet of the unit for it to operate properly and this typically take care of the issue. The farmer's market is definitely coming to an end, I would anticipate it to end come November. We're glad to hear that you recommend us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar."

"7307",3,"Front Desk Staff was not very friendly at check-in. Breakfast was a trainwreck do to soccer team taking complete ownership of the breakfast area. I would recommend the hotel because of its convenient location between VA beach and Norfolk downtown aside from the poor treatment displayed by the front desk staff."
"7308",5,"Pretty good place they are under remodel but they let you know that. You'll feel safe because the cops are always there not because of problems they just hangout there."
"7309",5,"Very nice hotel. Staff was very friendly, rooms were very nice and comfy, continental breakfast was good. Only thing that I would change would be to have some benches or seating outside. All in all nice motel."

"7311",5,"Quality Inn's service is the best of all the hotels i had stayed in my last trip. Location wise hotel was well placed next to the freeway, Hotel Rooms are very spacious. Breakfast spread is basic. Hotel has ample parking."
"7312",5,"Great hotel, very friendly desk personnel. You should note online and on phone that your free hotel shuttle is for dfw only. I called and confirmed that I was flying in but no one asked me which airport, I had to take a 30 cab each way. That would have made a difference in my choice of hotels or flights."
"7313",4,"Great hotel, excellent service from staff including front desk and the restaurant. Breakfast was a fair price and had many options. Food was excellent. Wait staff paid excellent attention to customers. Knew what they wanted for refills and such. And as I'm diabetic, I loved that they had sugar free stuff available. That impressed me a lot. What also impressed me a lot was the option of fruit as a substitute for fries with dinner. Never had that before. Front desk staff were very attentive and helpful. It was near enough to the colliseum, but the hotel and the colliseum are in a kinda tricky area to get in and out of. Nice area, just tricky to navigate. Would recommend to others and would definitely come back again. Rooms were comfy and beds were comfy too. Only complaint with room was very noisy air conditioner or fan or something in the room. All in all great hotel for a great price."
"7314",5,"Loved our stay however Elevator was broken and it took forever to catch. Great neighborhood!!!! Stores and restaurants galore!"

"7317",5,"We only stayed for one night, but I think would have been very happy had we needed a longer stay. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The lobby area and our room was very clean.

"7324",4,"Most probably I would give it a excellent review if it was not for the service obtained on Saturday. Sam (shuttle driver), Ester, Ana (Bar attendants) and front desk personnel for Thursday and Friday gave us a 5 star service. Everything went down to the drain Saturday afternoon had to wait for over an hour at the train station driver and front desk attendant blamed each other. I put it behind and most definitely I would stay again good breakfast, good service overall, location, rooms are kept clean."
"7325",5,"Renovated room was very nice. My request regarding a room on the first floor and close to where I would unload... handicap if possible... was met in all respects. Breakfast was hot and fresh, with all the usual items! Personnel were friendly and helpful:-)"

"7330",4,"The hotel was clean and inviting. The rooms were clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The free continental breakfast was okay. The scrambled eggs were dry and lacked flavor. I would stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to people."
"7331",5,"Good value compared to the hotels downtown DC. Good room, and good service."
"7332",5,"From the moment I arrived I had the best experience. The hotel was located near several restarants that were within walking distance and the hotel even had room servicee. The room was clean and very spacious. Another bonus was that there was free parking for rental cars or if you drove your own car. Overall great service and if I go back to the area I will definitely look into staying there again!"
"7333",3,"Some of the Front desk staff were knowledgeable others had very little information on the immediate area. When asked to recommend an Italian restaurant She had no idea. That was just one issue we had with front desk. Another complaint would be that the pool was so murky No one was using it."
"7334",4,"Great room, very clean, comfortable bed, fridge in room, front desk staff are very helpful and friendly. I would've given 5 stars however the elevator to my floor has been broken since I got here and the stairwell does not smell very clean."

"7340",1,"The hotel is poorly maintained, common areas like elevators were unkept, the breakfast was poor and in a bad location, and there was an infestation of bedbugs. The manager refused to talk to us even after two calls."
"7341",5,"Staff greets you by name. Clean and spacious rooms. The hotel is in the center of Caesars and convenient for walking throughout the propertype. Also easy to get to other hotels whether walking or by cab."

"7343",2,"We took our two kids to stay at this hotel and we had so many undesireable problems during our one night stay, it really ruined the trip. My kids and I got stuck in the elevator which scared my kids to death and they were afraid to get back on the elevator. This was a problem since our room was on the 27th floor. We ordered desert from room service and only got half of what was supposed to come with it and the guy acted put out when I asked him to go and get the rest of the order. The jets on the hot tub were not working, the steam room was not working, and the room with the pool was all gross and really worn down. Our blankets had stains on them in the room and the toilet ran for 45 minutes after flushing which was really loud throughout the room. Housekeeping came and knocked on the door at 8am even though we had the do not disturb sign out. For a four star hotel it lacks the amenities you would expect. Internet was extra and we had to pay $15/day to park. The only good thing was the location and the view was great! Other than that, a huge dissappointment and not worth the money! The worst part was that no one even cared to ask about my stay when we checked out..."

"7347",5,"Located right across the street from the Space Needle. The complementary breakfast buffet was excellent and much better than the Residence Inn hotels. There are several restaurants within walking distance for dinner. For the more economical meals, there is also a McDonalds across the street from the hotel. The Duck Boat tours also start from next to McDonalds.The rooms are of decent size and comfortable. They also have a complementary shuttle to the Pier 66 from where NCL ship departed. Will highly recommend it to people and will be my personal choice of stay in Seattle in future as well. The front desk staff is exceptionally polite and helpful (particularly Nate), and so are the shuttle bus drivers. Prices for the hotel are on the high end side, but so are most of the Seattle downtown hotels.ChandraHSGBI,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of our 24 hour shuttle and the complimentary breakfast spread in the morning. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge"
"7348",4,"Hotel was worth the price. Some false advertising, like complimentary bottled water and newspaper. Front desk can use a little customer relations training."
"7349",4,"This is a all new hotel. Excellent security and rooms. Don't let the neighborhood fool you. They are very nice owners.this is one of the few spotless hotels in va. Beach for under 100.00.the breakfast has more food choices than anyone really needs."
"7350",4,"Friendly helpful staff with the exception of breakfast staff. Beds are comfortable and room was clean. Dissapointed the hot tub was broken and the pool was freezing cold. Not a bad stay,but not up to a Hilton property standard."

The windows will open a couple of inches which helped. It was 17 degrees outside and 85 inside. So, it didn't take too long to cool the room temperature down. The breakfast was good. They actually have real eggs and you can get them cooked to order."

"7365",5,"I say that because I cancelled my second night stay from an awful hotel downtown and booked my second night at the Hotel Lincoln. Best decision I made the whole trip. The room was great (spacious, clean, well furnished and very modern) and the staff was even better. My wife had a bad stomach ache in the middle of the night and I called down to the front desk and asked if they had any Pepto-Bismol. They said no and started telling me where the nearest Walgreen's was and then stopped and offered to get some money from me and go get it for me since it was the middle of the night. I was super greatful and tried to give him a tip, he wouldn't take it. And that is just one example of how excellent the staff was. Next trip to Chicago I'm staying here again!"

The rooms were small but nice, the pool was fun for the kids and we were able to walk to the Pier and several restaurants. Overall, it was a great experience."
"7371",5,"Good parking lot size at hotel - no problems finding a spot for me. Hotel had a Tues night guest reception which was well attended the night I went...had food and drinks there. Hotel is older, but very clean. Front desk and all of staff was very accomodating and pleasant. Room was like an apt in size/good kitchen set up. I extended my stay for 2 extra nights. I felt very safe for a single woman traveler. Would probably be a good place to stay for families or groups as well."
"7372",4,"The staff was awesome! They gave me a free upgrade to a kids suite. The free breakfast left a little to be desired - (those were bran muffins - not chocolate) Room was nice and clean, the location was perfect for our trips to Disney."
"7373",5,"Bad: No microwave in room. Good: Bed extremely comfortable professional staff, extra clean. Great place. Also liked the 24-hour Starbucks."
"7374",1,"I was directed to the rear entrance but was unable to use the key card to open the door. This was evidently true for everyone as I heard loud banging on the door until I checked out. Also awakened by loud talking in the hall and barking dogs in the morning. Room was clean and nicely furnished but cheap, only... More"
"7375",4,"Pretty good stay, staff was a bit rude and our room was not ready when we arrived. Other than that, it was a good stay. Would go again in hopes of nicer maid services. The door man was very helpful and kind. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share the details of your recent stay. While I'm pleased you enjoyed your stay and our door man was helpful, I'm disappointed that any team member came across as rude. The team works hard to deliver exceptional service, it's clear we failed with your stay. We will discuss with the team to insure this does not happen further. Thank you for bringing to my attention.WayneGeneral Manager"
"7376",2,"This hotel is fresh and clean. The bath was spotless--and very pretty. No shower cap provided, though. For a newly renovated property, however, the lack of maintenance is shocking. The television emitted a sharp, prolonged buzz every two minutes or so. The thermostat was either broken or disabled, and since the windows do not open it was stifling. Yes, I... More"
"7377",3,"We were here three nights. there were some kids playing with fire bombs the first coupe nights and there were some smokers right above us that kept throwing their butts over the railing and one night there was a car in the handicapped place right outside our door. The gardener kept trying to keep the butts picked up and did a pretty good job of it!"
"7378",5,"Good: Location is great, 15 min away from Disneyland, Universal Studios, Airport. Breakfast was good, there is free parking and wifi as well as amazing small pool for refreshing. I would highly recommend this hotel, good value"

There was a great variety of breakfast and lunch foods, salads a variety of pastries and rolls and tons of desert items. My nephew hit the custom made to order omelet station... More"
"7380",5,"I can't think of anything I would have changed. JoAnn, the person at the desk, was amazing--managed to juggle phone calls and a line of people with courtesy and grace. The accessibility to Annapolis, rates, and cleanliness were outstanding. We'll definitely be back!"
"7381",4,"Bad: The valet parking is more expensive than at other hotels. However, we were able to find parking around the corner for 30 less. Good: The staff were very friendly and helpful with questions regarding the best way to reach sites. The game room on the second floor was fantastic and not at all crowded which is what I had anticipated. The hotel photos are exactly what you see when you arrive (this is often not the case with other hotels I've stayed in)."
"7382",5,"Weather was cold but we enjoyed the visit. I resent being forced to do this to enable your marketing. 50 words Minimum indeed!"
"7383",4,"This place had such a mix of reviews that I really hesitated to book it. But as I could see it's right in the center of Solvang--on the main drag in fact--I figured why not Well, we had a great room. The bed was a king and it was soft but firm. Pillows fine--I've had better but I've certainly had... More"
"7384",5,"The first time we went on vacation here we walked into our room and just started laughing. You get what you pay for. And here you are paying for location! What amazing views.

"7385",5,"Had a very good dinner took my husband for his birthday dinner.had seafood raviolis and wings very good. Nice bar very lovely bartender.homecooked meals."
"7386",1,"I would sleeep on the street rather than this Motel."
"7387",5,"Located right beside Asheville Outlet Mall. A big plus for my wife and daughter. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Always smiled and greeted us when we entered. This will be our first choice for a hotel for all our future visits to Asheville. Five to ten minutes from downtown."
"7388",5,"This hotel was Amazing! Though it's not as hip as the W Hotel, The location is amazing - right across the street from K-Pauls and Nola's - two great restaurants. Also, the pool is probably the best of any hotel pool and you really have to have the pool when it's around 90 degrees in the spring and summer. I highly recommend this hotel!"
"7389",5,"We had a nice stay, some family in other rooms near us. Floor was a bit slippery--not from uncleanliness, just wood floors--but otherwise we had a wonderful stay."
"7390",5,"We stayed 2 nights to celebrate our 28yr Anniversary. There are so many places to choose from on Cape Cod, but we are so very happy that we chose The Captain's Manor Inn. Everything was perfect - appearance and condition of the property, the quality of amenities in our room, the delicious breakfast and afternoon treats, and of course the... More"
"7391",1,"We travel fairly often and stayed in a lot of hotels. This is the most strange experience we have ever had (in a bad way). We pre-paid three nights' stay. After the first night, we went out to tour the city. When we came back in the evening, we realized all the stuff we left in the closet, the dresser... More"
"7392",5,"Ever time we travel to D.C., one of our kids' favorite destinations, we struggle to find the right place in the right area. We either find a nice place that is almost a mile from the Metro stop or we find a crappy place within steps of a stop. The Ritz was on-point. From the ambience, to the staff, the quality of food, cleanliness of the rooms, down to the way they treated our children we loved it! The cherry on the ice cream is the Ritz is litterally 100 ft from the Metro. We will never search for a hotel again!"
"7393",5,"I checked in very late and was informed by the very nice guest services rep that they had oversold the hotel for the evening. I've traveled extensively and this happens occasionally and I wasn't really upset and she said they had me set up with a complimentary evening at a nearby hotel if I didn't mind a 10 minute drive.... More"
"7394",5,"We had a wonderful 5 day stay here! We enjoyed everything about this hotel. The staff was friendly, housekeeping was great, the grounds were well kept and constantly being worked on while we were there. The breakfast was exceptional. Its close to beaches and San Diego attractions I would absolutely recommend this Marriott and stay here again and again. Thanks for a great stay!Thanks for the top score review. I am confident that future travelers to San Diego and to our hotel will find your review very helpful. Please come back and see us again in the future.Regards,Jonathan CorrellGeneral Manager"
"7395",5,"Parking is available at a parking garage a few streets away if you use the one recommended by the hotel. The rate the hotel give you is not the lowest rate you can get, I parked at the same parking lot for less using a parking app. It is worth looking into this if you are driving. Secondly, make sure you try and get a room with a queen bed. The doubles are tiny and this was my only regret with staying at this hotel. The location of the property is excellent. Easy to get to from the freeway, and easy to walk to Boston Common, restaurants, bars and local tourist attractions. Staff were very helpful on arrival and during the stay. No expense was spared in the room in terms of technology (had hard wired speakers even in the bathroom). Not sure they are needed, but was a nice touch. Rooms were clean, bathrooms small but had everything you need and was nice to have a shower not standing over a bath for once."
"7396",5,"As a lifetime Diamond member, I have stayed at many Hilton Properties. Several within New Orleans. The decor is contemporary and colorful. Rooms are spacious and well kept. The best part of my stay was the staff. Carl was especially helpful and made our stay easier. i will definitely be back.Thank you for taking the time to write this excellent review and for choosing our hotel as your place to stay during this recent trip to New Orleans. It sounds like our property and service provided exceeded all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests. Carl will be commended for his efforts in going above and beyond to ensure you were well taken care of and we look forward to having you back as our guest very soon.Best regards,"
"7397",5,"Bad: Not a fan of cigarette smoke. But I guess you can't do anything about it in the gambling area. Silly to charge a resort fee on top of the room charge. Just charge what you need for the room. Good: Very helpful and friendly staff from check in to the valets."
"7398",4,"A standard not fancy hotel that provides a little privacy and extra space at a good rate if you want an affordable suite. Decent pretty big breakfast buffet (could someone figure out that 15 of us don't digest dairy and really like having something like soy or almond milk). little pool only good for kids. Nice big lobby and lounge areas.Jesse L,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge"
"7399",5,"I absolutely positively enjoyed my stay at this hotel, I highly recommend it. That guy John W. At the front desk is the greatest love his positive energy and his enthusiastism he made my day. The price is definitely right!!! Rooms are very spacious and well put together...I'll definitely be back"
"7400",5,"Everybody from the front desk to those that cleaned the room did a fantastic job of making our stay very enjoyable. Thanks to all of them."
"7401",5,"Hotel is in a great location for Napa and Sonoma wine tasting. Good breakfast and wine tasting from 5 to 6 pm in the lobby. Clean hotel with nice patio. Decent workout room and friendly staff make for a pleasant stay."
"7402",5,"this is my first time feeling compelled to write a good review... The room was perfect... fireplace, jacuzzi tub, extremely comfortable bed and bedding!

The free breakfast was more than adequate and the staff was very friendly. This hotel is located about 25 miles from Rockville and has plenty of fast food places nearby to get a late... More"
"7405",4,"This hotel was great overall--clean, decent sized rooms, and good breakfast. However, the only problem was that I was told when I booked it that it had a free shuttle. We were counting on using this to get to and from ACL. There was no shuttle, so this added some extra cost and planning. I would stay here again."
"7406",3,"Bad: Within the first 15 minutes of being there we got a complaint from a neighbor for having music too loud. The speaker was not even up half way and it was 4 oclock in the afternoon on a Saturday. At the end of the night staff were rude."
"7407",5,"Perfect location. Very nice rooms. Great included breakfast. Very helpful, competent, and friendly staff. Will visit again."
"7408",5,"Went there with friends for vacation. It was very impressed with the location and service. couple blocks away from cable car and shopping places. we've had city walk through out the city. it was fun doing that with friends, taking pictures, chitchatting, and eating. but afterward we were super tired. After a long day, i stopped at the bar for... More"
"7409",4,"Hotel was a fantastic location. The room was unique and we'll maintained. Enjoyed the blue light located throughout the property. Bed was conformable, however small. Good and happy vibe. 1 opportunity I would make for improvement is the timeliness for valet. Car retrival took well over 30 mintutes. I noticed their bell staff was not around and the lobby hardly have anyone in it. When you are paying 30+ for valet it should be rocket speed. Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your time here and we hope you will come back and see us again. Parking and valet services can take some time because our parking lot is located six blocks off-site. We are happy that even though you experienced issues with this you still enjoyed your stay."
"7410",1,"We will NEVER stay in Quality Inn again!!! My wife and I arrived at 11:20PM and no one was in the front desk. We waited for 20 minutes unattended and finally someone came to check us in. While we were in the room, we found one of the twin bed did not have blanket/comforter. We called 3 times and the last answer was the house keeper left and he would send us one TOMORROW MORNING. It was 1:30AM by then and we were all exhausted and decided to give up and sleep with A/C off."
"7411",5,"The hotel beds were very comfortable, I slept like a baby."
"7412",2,"Room/hotel was not in great condition. Housekeeping left a note on first morning saying they had not cleaned the room because they were protecting our privacy - and we did not have a DND sign out, nor were we in our room late. Free WiFi was only free because it never worked. Breakfast food wasn't refilled - and there was still 30 min remaining."
"7413",5,"This is by far the best Hampton Inn my wife and I have ever stayed in, and we've been in quite a few. For that matter, it's one of the best of its class among all of the hotels we've known. We had a nice, clean suite, quiet, well lit, neatly arranged with a desk/divider between the very comfortable bed and the sitting area. Staff were friendly and polite, the breakfast good, prices reasonable. Little notes left by the cleaners were a nice touch. Our only complaint was that the wireless Internet kept dropping out on checkout the desk clerk apologized and said that the hotel has been trying to solve this problem (our room also had an ethernet cable, unusual these days, but I hadn't brought an adapter for my laptop). In spite of this - not enough to affect the rating - highly recommended!"
"7414",5,"We were very impressed with the friendliness of the registration clerks at both check in and check out. Hotel was very clean and had all the amenities with a very reasonable price. I would recommend this hotel to all."
"7415",5,"I was on my way to Cincinnati and stopped over for the night. My room was very nice and the area was nice and quiet. If you have kids they will like the pool and splash park. I didn't use the area, but saw kids in and out all day/night and parental supervision is required which is nice. As a... More"
"7416",3,"Bad: The day shift wouldn't believe me that something was wrong with the room door lock and made me re-key. Then, they sent the cleaning staff to 'open my door for me' only to discover that the electronic key system won't work if the batteries in the lock haven't been replaced. Lastly, I never could figure out how to make the steam shower work, but after the episode with the door I decided it wasn't worth asking. Good: The night shift desk was helpful and once she realized she'd made a mistake, she went about solving the problem as quickly as she could. I was still locked out of my room for 30 to 45 minutes."
"7417",2,"The Hotel itself is nice and fairly clean. However, booked the hotel months ago and when we arrived, which was late and after 12am, we were told that our twin room was not available, they had sold it, and we could have a double room with 1 bed. They were going to put up a portable bed, but took them a while to find it. We were offered to go to other hotel, but they were fully booked too. The hotel changed the room the following night, but no compensation, apart from a free drink which we had to fight for as well, were offered."
"7418",4,"Hotel is very nice and cozy. Rooms are clean and good sized. Great friendly staff despite how very busy they were. Lobby was a nice place to relax and socialize with our friends. Very close to the Metro connectivity. really enjoyed our stay"
"7419",5,"The room was nice although a little bit small. The employees were very nice. It was really nice to have snacks, sodas, coffee and water at all times. The price was really good realeated to the services. I definitely recommend it.Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your recommendation. I am happy to know you enjoyed the complimentary amenities as well as the staff services. Please come see us again!"
"7420",4,"Bad: Very minimal breakfast. Good: Great location."
"7421",5,"Good: Everything"
"7422",5,"very clean, well kept hotel. The staff was friendly and efficient. Nice bonus having a salt water swimming pool and hot tub indoors."
"7423",5,"This is a great Marriott property if you want to be close to the baseball game. I choose this location as it was close enough for me to conduct my business, yet far enough away from my local family Centrally located and surrounded by eateries.

"7424",4,"Good: No hassle, stress-free stay."
"7425",5,"We have stayed at the Warner many times. Always clean, very helpful staff and right in downtown West Chester, close to everything. Limited parking on site but discount parking available near by. Lots of nice shops and restaurants , just walk out the front door. They tend to fill up fast so book early."
"7426",4,"I find this place to be a quiet place to stay. I have never had any problems with my rooms. They have been comfy and clean and I will stay again when in the area.

"7428",1,"When we first got to the Hotel I was parallel parking and A bum try to pretend to get hit by me. Then asked me for money. Then we checked in an that was painless. We got to our room and I felt like I was in a crack house. Our reservation said a balcony which there was not. The windows were so high that you couldn't see out side unless you stood on a chair. It felt like we were in a dungeon but we were on the second floor. No fridge ,no safe. It looked like someone stole the fridge."
"7429",5,"Room was very clean and quiet. Beds were extremely comfortable to sleep in. All staff we interacted with were polite and friendly. We will definitely look to stay at The Inn on any future visit to the area."
"7430",4,"We were in area for a memorial service, so room booked on short notice. This Hampton was at a good location with shopping close by,also near major highways but yet secluded. We found the staff pleasant helpful, hotel was updated and rooms were clean nice but average size. Breakfast at this hotel was exceptional for motels/hotels."
"7431",5,"First clean comfortable and quiet rooms. Great view from the rooms that are bayside (ask for it) but breakfast area has same great view. Great full breakfast (free). Staff treats you like they are glad you are there and glad they work there . Several really good restaurants are less than .4 miles and .easy walk"
"7432",5,"We stayed at the Aloft for a business trip. It was super convenient having this hotel right next door to convention center! Staff nice, rooms clean, beds were comfy and spacious, great bar and outdoor space to relax! Ill stay here again if I have to come back for work. Train station a little over two miles away. I submitted a survey the first night there asking for an orange pen (they have the best) and the next day before lunch there was a bag hanging on my door with four pens in it. Talk about paying attention to detail. What a great customer experience. Hi Sarah, FIVE BUBBLES!!! We love it, thank you!! Glad you got some time to chill in our Backyard, it's the perfect place to hang after a day of work. If the 4 pens run out, you know where to get more :) Come back just for fun, we are not only about serving you for work. Perhaps you can PEN a best seller...Happy Summer, Evan"
"7433",5,"Everything we ate was fresh and tasty! We had the best stuffed blueberry french toast and make sure you try the pecan chicken. Melts in your mouth!"
"7434",5,"Pool, elevator, laundry room It has everything I needed, any questions the staff had beyond taken care of me, such hospitality that makes you feel at home when you're away. Dominique and Nounie are incredible managers and have a wonderful crew. Thank you all."
"7435",5,"We were visiting our son in Crete but the hotels in Crete were totally booked. We would definitely stay here again. The hotel was a quick and pretty drive from Crete. The hotel was clean and had a nice bar area."
"7436",5,"We spent 3 days at this hotel, whilst at a convention at the Anaheim Convention Center and at Disneyland. Although this is not the closest hotel property to either, it is the best as far as hospitality and professionalism go. We arrived a bit before the posted check in and before too long, we were able to go to our room. I have to say the visit to the Towneplace Suites, Anaheim was made exceptional by the staff that works there, notably Adilene at the front desk. The smiling and professional service that she provided is what one would expect at a Ritz Carlton or St. Regis property. Note to management: You should hold on to and value employees like Adilene.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your 5 star review. I am glad to hear that Adi and our team were able to give you 5 star service during your visit to Anaheim.I hope to see you on our next Disneyland Adventure! Hospitably,Greg WilliamsGeneral Manager"

"7439",3,"The hotel was really nice! Although the room furniture was a little outdated, I had no complaints otherwise. A shuttle to the Metro was perfect! The staff was really friendly and accomodating. If you want a DC vacation without the expense or hassle of traffic, stay at this hotel!"

"7451",5,"Wonderful as always, the consistent level of quality is always reassuring and so pleasant"

I would totally stay here again.Thank you for filling our out survey. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay with us! We look forward to having the opportunity to serve you on your next visit to Wichita. Have a nice day!"
"7453",3,"It would be really nice if when a hotel is under construction, that is stated before it is booked so we can then make a decision if we want to deal with it or not. It really is not a surprise you want when you get there. When I walked into my room there were caulk guns on the floor and other construction materials laying around. How does that get missed when the room is cleaned"

"7455",1,"Bed were made poorly, cigarette ashes in bathroom floor. Over all a sloppy sleepless stay."
"7456",4,"I go to Seattle very frequently for business, and this hotel was the 5th that I've stayed in this city. The room was good and clean. Wifi was stable. TV reception was not the best, but wasn't bad eiter.The hotel is right by the lake, so a nice pleasant walk outside. It's also close to a few restaurants and a corner store.Overall, I think it was a good hotel."
"7457",4,"The property is clean and well-maintained. The staff works hard to make you feel comfortable. The free breakfast is good, although it could use some more fruit. Most of the price is right, given the time of year we were there and are in Naples. One thing - it is outside of town and a bit of a drive. If... More"
"7458",3,"We checked in at 3.30 am and the lady at the front desk didn't seem happy to see us. No greeting or smiling. She quickly gave us the keys and didn't bother to give us any information on breakfast timings or free wi fi. She was rude in short. The guy during check out was very friendly. The room was clean but the beds were very hard. The trash can in the room was nasty and when i looked at it by mistake i lost my appetite. It wasn't bad, but not worth the price i paid for it. For 10 more i could've stayed at bigger hotels close to it. Oh and breakfast wasn't anything to die for. We ended up not eating there."
"7459",5,"Bad: Though I booked through Bookings.com, they had no record of my reservations nor could they find any. They compted us and our driver with free drinks until they got it straightened out. Fortunately they still had a double room. The manager bought dessert after our lovely bar light dinner as well!!. Good: We had a wonderful stay prior to an early morning flight to Geneva, Switzerland"

"7463",5,"Will be back. Staff was very friendly, flexible and generous. Vibe was Santa Monica with a Euro, modern flavor. Everyone on the team went above and beyond to both personalize and create a top notch experience."
"7464",4,"I had to attend a meeting here and decided to stay the night. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. Nice pool andJacuzzi. Coffee shop also served Starbucks coffee but had their own sandwiches which were really good and worth the price. Most of the other guests there also had breakfast there rather than in the nearby mall and were happy with their orders as well. The mall is also quite near, walking distance with a wide selection of food."

"7466",4,"Bad: Extremely disappointed in Fremont Street. It used to be my favorite place to play/stay in Vegas but I will not be back. Very strange people just standing in the middle of the street. Cartoon characters, men in thongs and even one in an adult diaper! It's Hollywood Blvd on steroids! Thanks for the memories, Downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street Experience is one I do not wish to repeat!. Good: The hotel was very nice, much nicer than The Plaza next door."
"7467",5,"Great place, location, and I appreciate the coffee available in the lobby."
"7468",4,"I chose this hotel from Hotwire for a three night stay before a cruise. I was travelling with my wife, daughter, and two grandsons. This is a beautiful, clean hotel. There is a pool on the property that is a good size, and then just behind the hotel is the beach with a life guard stand very close by. Towels... More"
"7469",3,"We were there for only 8 hours, but it was convenient and good for a quick sleep. Was thrown off by the 10 charge for the pet, when it wasn't mentioned in the reservation process. We were told pets were welcome, but no additional charge. We had some rambunctious neighbors, and the office took care of the issue as soon as we called down to the office, so that was great!"
"7470",5,"This was my first visit to NOLA and chose the Omni on a friends recommendation - was very pleased. Location is excellent, good service and friendly employees. Rooms are small (we upgraded to a deluxe room/queen (still small) but clean, comfy and great water pressure in the shower :). Bar lounge nice (singer Yadonna was very enjoyable). Good Rooftop...

"7471",4,"Perfect for one night visit to tour SDSU. Room was clean, looked newly renovated and very comfortable. Not sure I'd hang out at the pool, though. Double queen room was good for 2 people would have been tight with family of 4. Staff was friendly and courteous. Breakfast was fresh and plentiful. Centrally located to all attractions. Would definitely stay again."
"7472",4,"Mediocre. 2-12 hole in the carpet. Reading lamp missing from desk. Only one bulb in the lamp on the bedside stand, so the room was dark! Overall attention to details is lacking. The front desk staff are polite and helpful. The HVAC unit works well and is relatively quiet."
"7473",5,"From the time we walked in and greeted by Frank we knew it was going to be an amazing place. Frank gave us some local tips and Ed escorted us to our beautiful room making sure we had everything we needed, bringing us extra water and suggesting places to eat. We were there for 2 amazing nights, shame we didn't take as much advantage as we could have being.located in the shopping plaza..... So so many shops. Courteous, friendly staff. Service impeccable, in fact we rushed in after a full day had a quick shower before meeting friends, returned and found fresh towels! Amazing"
"7474",4,"good"
"7475",5,"Very nice hotel in a good location. Staff was pleasant and welcoming. I was Hilton's guest of the day which was a pleasant surprise! I love Hampton Inns and find them to be a great value. Breakfast is an additional bonus."
"7476",5,"I have visited Chicago often in the past and always have booked a different hotel.I am glad I changed this time and booked The River Hotel in Chicago.I was pleasantly greeted by a clean crisp modern room that offered plenty of space. I must also add that this is a green Hotel with lots of Green features built in.Some of the details of our stay included:Security system that only allows guests of that floor to enter that floor.Purified water provided at each floor.A coffee pot in the main room.... Not in the bathroom.A refrigerator and microwave.Luxury comforter.Comfortable chair that folds out into single bed.A greeting welcoming us on the voice mail system.

"7478",5,"Absolutely the best property and people. We've been coming every Labor Day Weekend for 10 years, plus usually once or twice during the year. For a family reunion there is no better place. The rooms are always pristine, the pool area is a delight, the picnic are and the bowling alley/restaurant on the property makes it ideal. We love it... More"
"7479",4,"My husband and I stayed here one night on our way to Santa Fe. The hotel is nice and on the west side of town. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Having a small fridge was nice. The front desk folks were very friendly. We would stay here again."

"7484",5,"The staff at Comfort Suites is very accommodating, and easy to work with. I had to extend my stay, and they were happy to help me. Also, the breakfast is probably one of the best that I have had in a hotel buffet very tasty."
"7485",4,"So, I met my Valentine at the Greyhound Bus station in downtown Pittsburgh, Pa. I was coming back from Cleveland, Ohio. She was on her way to Buffalo, New York. A few months later we went to an Isley Brothers concert at the Civic Arena. We stayed at the hotel across the street, which is now the Marriott City Center.... More"

"7491",5,"This was a super place for our convention needs. The room was clean, efficient, and allowed for green savings (5.00 coupon per day when maid service for towels and sheets weren't laundered We redeemed the daily coupons at the XYZ Bar in the lobby!). Loved the room layout which allowed for a long bench between desks for our double bed... More"
"7492",4,"Although the hotel was a bit run down we enjoyed our week long stay. The staff were really helpful and friendly and it had a swimming pool which was a bonus! The shuttle service is good. If your not looking for a fancy hotel then I would recommend staying here. Lots of good resturants near by abs easy to get the metro to Washington."
"7493",5,"The hotel was small but looked newly renovated. I came with my boyfriend who was visiting me from out of town and I live in Hawaii so we decided to spend a night here.

"7494",5,"I love this hotel. It was cheaper than the ones - Sheraton and Marriott on Canal - where a conference I was attending was held. The decor is beautiful (Erykah Badu-like art on the wall and retro galore with a bit of artisan flare). My room was at the end of the corner and I didn't hear a thing, a privilege when traveling in a major city. The front desk manager called later to see if I had a good stay. Shout-out to Kavana at the front desk who was kind up my check out and departure as well as the people working in the first floor restaurant. The endive salad and fish was a perfect meal. The roof top bar looked like a lot of fun, but aside from a quick snap shot, I didn't stay as I needed to decompress from my travels. But I shall return. 12-15 minute safe walk to the Quarter. Take Rampart or any parallel street to Canal and head toward river.Thank you for taking the time to review our property and we are delighted to know you had a great stay with us. It sounds like every part of your experience at our hotel was perfect which is music to our ears. We certainly appreciate you staying with us and look forward to having you back as our guest whenever your travels bring you back to Nola.Best regards,"
"7495",2,"We stayed at this hotel because it was in Boone (Iowa) and we had a visitation there and a funeral the next morning. It was clean, but we did have some issues. The smaller coffee pot (5 cup) was nice to have in the room, but it didn't work correctly. The bathroom was clean, but the tub had a really slow drain. There was a clock radio in the room, but it wasn't set to the correct time (a personal pet peeve) so I had to set it - and it was really difficult to figure out and then it was bolted down to the table with only about 3/4 leeway on the cord, so we also couldn't move it out a little bit to be able to see the time if either of us woke up during the night (again, a personal issue). However, the breakfast in the morning was really well stocked...basic continental breakfast foods with 2 waffle makers...so not very varied, but was good. Staff was in and out making certain that there was enough food out and cleaning off tables that had been used. If you need to stay in Boone, it would be alright - as long as that is all that you are expecting. Otherwise, I would suggest staying in Ames and driving over since it isn't all that far away."
"7496",4,"This is the 2nd time we stayed at this motel, we travel for Craft Shows. Like the fact that you park off to the side and are on a service road. Ease of in and out makes it easy for us. Only problem is no breakfast available until 7 and we need to be gone by 6 am to set... More"
"7497",3,"I was on the ground floor. The slamming doors are horrible!! Woke me up all night, I am a very sound sleeper. Then the second night, there was a wedding. Talking, screaming, doors slamming all night until 4am. Then outside my window, people were gathering and also talking all night."
"7498",5,"Good: Very friendly staff. And perfect location in the theater district."
"7499",1,"I travel constantly and stay at hotels nearly every night and I can say that this place is no place for any human being the blankets are unwashed and the Bathroom is disgusting, everything stinks and is amazingly filthy. After a full day of flying cross country and driving 200 miles I was too exhausted to leave... An there is... More"
"7500",4,"We had a power outage and had to think quickly. I went online and saw this hotel. The staff was great. The young man was training someone when we walked in but made us feel very welcomed."
