"2",5,"Wonderful as always, the consistent level of quality is always reassuring and so pleasant"
"3",4,"Location was very convenient, although using their free shuttle to Metro Station probably is not that convenient. We just parked at the station for 4.50/day. If you don't have a car, then I think you could make the shuttle work for you, or take a cab. We booked 2 rooms. Cons: Both were very small, with shabby, 80's looking furnishings. Rooms had an unpleasant musty smell that a/c didn't remedy. One room we booked did not have a fridge and microwave although the hotel lists that as an amenity for their rooms. Ice machine only available on 2nd floor. There isn't one on 4th floor and the one on 3rd floor didn't work. Old-style TV's when almost every other hotel in this category has nicer flat screens. Beds, while somewhat comfortable, were made up with not so great linens (thin sheets, old bedspreads). No laundry room, which is only needed for multi-day stays. Pros: Good housekeeping service swimming pool kept very clean with a lifeguard present at all times, towels are sometimes available at the pool EXCELLENT full hot breakfast available with enough options for daily variety for a multi-day stay. All in all, would probably look a little closer at another Springfield, VA lodging option if visiting in the future. Although most of our time spent in a hotel room is simply sleeping or preparing to go out for the day, would prefer to have just a little more elbow room than this hotel offers."
"4",4,"We were very tired when we arrived with a cranky baby. Pierre at the front desk was very helpful and got us in our room quickly. We had some difficulty with the door, the handle had to be pushed up, instead of down, which delayed us getting into the room. The room was clean though somewhat worn/dated (old phones, ceiling in bathroom had areas that needed repair/patched, carpet was threadbare in some areas, etc.). We were thankful that the room was very quiet which help us to get a good few hours of sleep before my daughter and grandson's flight. The shuttle driver that took us to BWI was exceptionally helpful and I was very grateful that he came back to pick me up after seeing my daughter and grandson off."
"5",3,"Somewhat updated, nice fireplace and clean. We booked a king with a Jacuzzi tub and river view. We got everything however there was no patio or balcony for us to sit on to see the river, in fact there wasn't a door leading out to the river, we could only see it from a window. Someone turned off the fridge... More"

"10",5,"I cannot recall the last time I had an issue at a Drury Inn. Well, we did not have one at this location. The room was comfortable, the staff was attentive and helpful, and it was nicely priced more importantly, we got the last available room for the evening. Next, their complimentary breakfast was good, as well as their late afternoon meal from 5 PM 7 PM. Also, you have to have a key card to access their customer parking area. It was a nice feature which prevents people with ill intentions from driving around scoping out the scene."
"11",3,"This was a stop over on a cross country driving trip. We had high hopes for this place and were hoping we would like it enough to stay two nights. One night was more than enough. Upon check in we were directed to a suite that required us to go down a floor from the lobby. Got there and felt... More"

"20",4,"Part of a roadtrip through USA. Staff here are very helpful and the hotel is modern and well kept. The location is a little a way out of town, but this is reflected in the price."
"21",4,"This is one of only a handful of times I have stayed at Hampton Inns. For the most part it was great. Unfortunately the tub in my room would not drain so while you showered you stood in water up to your ankles.

"24",4,"Very pleased with our overall stay. For the most part, staff friendly and helpful especially the concierge. We were disappointed with the menu at the Barbados Room. We were hoping to just enjoy a nice dinner upon our arrival and were not prepared to go searching for a reservation outside the hotel after a day of traveling. After reviewing the menu, we realized there was no real ""dinner"" menu. Just sandwiches and pizza etc. What a waste of such a lovely room. And the drinks leave a lot to be desired. Pool and outside courtyard are lovely. Hotel is very clean. We did encounter some really rude loud guests who decided to continue their party in the hallway at 3 a.m. Easter Sunday. But guess you cannot do a background check of incoming guests."

"28",1,"I took my significant other to Springhill Suites for a weekend of relaxation for his birthday and I was very disappointed. When we decided to lay down there was a blood stain on 2 different sheets. We also did not use the shower because it was a grey film covering the bottom of the bathtub. I also think there was a laundry room next to us due to all of the noise and banging early in the morning. Overall, the cleanliness of the room was a problem, but the front desk staff was very friendly!! oh and I could've done without the breakfast!!"
"29",5,"We were blown away at the dcor and style of this Courtyard Marriott! We were finishing our vacation week which was split between Myrtle and Charleston SC and we had just been very disappointed by our stay in Charleston at the Hyatt Place. This was just what we needed to turn things around! We were going to a show at the House of Blues and it was perfect, just down the street! Plenty of gas, mini golf, food, bars, shopping etc nearby! We arrived early and they did not have rooms ready so they gave us free waters and snacks and although we maybe waited 30 mins for a room they kept checking on us as well as still got us into a room before the posted check in time on 4th of July weekend! I would highly recommend this hotel!!"

"44",4,"This is not a super luxurious hotel with expensive furniture and fancy rooms. But for what it is, a chain with the usual rooms and extras, it is everything one could ask for. We were checked in by a pleasant and helpful clerk. The room was clean and quiet with a microwave oven, refrigerator, a large TV, and free WiFi. We used the laundry and fitness room facilities which were modern and clean. One of us chose the standard breakfast (coffee or tea, two eggs, sausage or bacon, toast or hash browns), offered at the Denny's next door, which was free. The other got 5 toward one of the other breakfasts offered on the menu. Both were satisfactory. We would stay there again.Thank you for your review and we will see you on your next visit to Napa."

There is nothing happening right around the hotel, but it is near a marina."

"67",5,"Bad: The only thing I wish there could have been is hot food choices for breakfast, such as eggs and bacon or sausage. I did like how they set up the breakfast on each floor. That was very nice, however, having a place to eat outside of our room would be nice. But knowing there isn't anywhere to do that I think you do an excellent job with everything. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you. Good: The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very clean and updated. We stayed in the deluxe king room. Staff were all very nice and helpful!"
"68",4,"I have stayed at this property each time I visit family in New Jersey. Always very nice with super clean rooms, friendly staff and a great restaurant. Easy to get to and affordable. They have a well sorted Libby with snacks, sundries, business area and the requisite Tvs, lounge area and breakfast space. I'll be back."
"69",4,"Small hotel which made it nice. Not a lot of people all over the place. Rooms very clean and spacious with balconies in every room. Every room had beach view. Not on the beach, it's separated by the boardwalk. In which you come out of your room and you are right there with all the activities and restaurants. Very nice night life, and the beach is still right there. I do recommend this Hotel"

"76",5,"Came for a weekend with a child. The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful. Breakfast was stocked and ready. Pool area was clean and the rooms were very nice. Would definitely recommend. Had no complaints at all. They are located a little off the beaten path but it was nice and quiet."
"77",2,"Imagine our disgust when we woke the following morning and found that the bed sheets had stains all over them.  If the hotels do nothing else, they should make absolutely certain their housekeeping staff is top notch and that they actually clean a room and change the bedding.  There were also dead insects on the floor of the bathroom.  I now know why this hotel had rooms available while everyone else was sold out."
"78",4,"Really nice stay. Clean, modern room, comfy bed, good channels, great location (15 min walk from Disneyland/CA Adventure), but a very high security deposit of 100. A lot of money for someone if they don't know beforehand."

"80",5,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at XV Beacon. All of the staff was friendly and attentive. The location is perfect for exploring Boston and for anywhere a little further, a driving service is offered. The driver, Mark, was very friendly and made sure to point out notable sites along the drive. The rate is expensive, but we enjoyed the high-level of service with multiple tidy services offered each day. The room was very comfortable for us."

"84",5,"Everything from the property to staff were delightful. This place lacks a pool however. They pride themselves on authenticity. I requested a late check-out and was surprised to have that shut-down immediately. They did however accommodate an early check-in from 4:00 to 1:30ish."

Easy access to property and to find things to do. the bed was confortable and the room was super clean. the staff is honest because i left my credit card in the room and they call me to return it."
"88",3,"The breakfast was very good. The beds were quite hard. Enjoyed our stay though and would stay there again."
"89",4,"The location is very, very inconvenient, but I am sure that is nothing they can help, it is just how the city has grown around their location. I would have rated the room as a 4 or 5 for clean if the sofa was not so disgusting. I literally covered it with a sheet just to sit on it. There was not one inch of surface that was not covered with a greasy/dirty stain. I would have switched rooms if I hadn't already unloaded all of my stuff in the rain before I turned on the lights to reveal the nasty sofa. Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable. It would be worth a couple of hundred dollars to get a steam cleaner and clean the sofas in each room. Not to mention how unsanitary it is."
"90",5,"The food was excellent with a great view. My husband and I loved our meal and service at the Esmeralda Restaurant. The chef here is amazing. Also the service was fabulous. Definitely a must visit if in the area."
"91",3,"Perfect place if you are looking for a more reasonable (quieter and not so expensive) place to stay. The best part of the hotel is that it is on the beach and boardwalk.

"96",3,"Bad: I was overcharged at the property and after two requests to front desks no one got back to me. The third time I went to follow up myself. They overcharged me 130 dollars for the room. The hotel was under renovation so it was not good being on a partial construction site with the sound of drills going off. I would advise to shop around on the strip. Good: Bed was comfortable"

"101",4,"We chose this hotel based on the price and location. It certainly lived up to our expectations. It was by far the best value for money I could find with most other hotels almost double. Given we would be out and about most days we just wanted something decent we could get a good sleep in and was clean.River Hotel check in was quick and easy. After a long flight we asked for a quiet room that had a great view when we woke up.We got a room with a view of the alley way and some kind of air con vents outside (1011). Whatever the air con thing was outside had a constant hum and it would drive anyone crazy.The air con in the room was the only thing noisier! Impossible to sleep with it on even with the supplied ear plugs. It's not the city noise that's the problem it's these two things.We loved the free filtered water and bottles.So overall looking back on this trip I think the value and location win out ever so slightly. Maybe a different room would make a difference to this review overall of the hotel."

"103",5,"We booked this hotel last minute. We thought it was going to kind of A mediocre room. When we arrived there was plenty of parking and best of all parking is free.

We arrived a few hours before check in and they held our luggage while we explored the area. Lots of shopping an dinner choices close by. T was 2 minutes away. Room was nice."
"106",5,"Bad: That we were only there for 2 nights. Good: Very spacious room, with a partial ocean view from the balcony. Rooftop pool and seating looked amazing. Staff were very friendly, and food was excellent. Eric's 'Honey Jalapeno Ginger Margaritas' were superb!"

"108",5,"I stayed at Ritz-Carlton Hotel during my last visit.However, St. Regis is located right on the 5th avenue where I dropped by twice.Once for a afternoon tea at Astor Court, after a long busy day. Varieties of sandwiches and scones were nicely served, just like they do at Ritz, London, I skipped dinner on that evening.The next evening I dropped by to have light snack before evening play. The club sandwich was a simple menu but the most delicious I have had. The over all service is excellent.I would definitely stay at this hotel if it situated near the Central Park, like Ritz-Carlton.Dear spaniel12, On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for sharing the details of your recent visit to Astor Court on TripAdvisor.At The St. Regis New York, we pride ourselves on our personalized service, and we are so glad that you were able to experience this first hand.Please let us know when you will be returning to New York, as we would love to welcome you back as our guest.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"109",5,"My 93 year old mother and caregiver were evacuated due to the fires. This Best Western made every accommodation to make them welcome and comfortable. They did NOT jack the rates up knowing there would be hundreds of people looking for a place to stay. They did NOT charge extra for leaving sooner than expected. They behaved as compassionately as possible."
"110",5,"My stay was short...wished I could have stayed longer. Check in was fast. Staff very professional. Hotel was clean and inviting. Suite was spacious for a high rise Hotel. Expected cramped however, was pleasently surprised by it's size. Restaurant and convenience stores within walking distance. The Hotel is in a residential neighborhood, not much activity surrounding it. Although there is a fee for parking, It was the cheapest in the area."
"111",5,"Bad: I had to be switched because these people next door were partying all hours of the night. At 3am they decided to start arguing in the hall. I called security once for them to turn up their music right after they left. Then security came up again while they were in the hall screaming. I will say this the hotel made it right. They gave me that night free and switched me rooms. Good: The rooms were beautiful. Comfy beds good breakfast."
"112",5,"The location feels like a small paradise. The views are breathtaking. Beautiful sunsets.

"122",4,"Everything was great with the hotel except our bathroom. There was no bathtub. I believe it was probably a handicap room. Not having a bathtub caused water to go all over the floor which caused me to slip on the floor."
"123",5,"The Embassy Suites Lithicum provided a high quality venue for our youth baseball team as we participated in a tournament that weekend. The team loved the atmosphere and ambiance of this Hilton brand hotel. It is among the nicer hotels that we now stay in due to an experience that we had with the standard accomodations at popular hotel chains such as DI, M6, S8, HJ, etc. The cook to order breakfast was a bonus. My only complaint would be is that it is a loud hotel on the weekend with special events and people constantly hanging out of there rooms on the atrium. It would also be great to at least provide free wireless in the common areas. The fee for wireless was almost 10/day and the business center was always full."
"124",4,"I got a room on the 2nd floor and when I mentioned about having 2 kids, the front desk person immediately checked and provided a room allotted for handicapped people as it was available. Kudos to her (Couldn't get her name) and it made our stay more pleasant. I will certainly try this place again when I visit this region."

"127",5,"Bad: Toothpaste. I wish more hotels came with toothpaste in the bathroom . I hate calling to get some. It's a necessity. That's my only complaint, but that's pretty much for every hotel I've stayed in. Good: The bed was beyond comfortable, didn't want to get up at all"
"128",4,"the hall was very nice, food was great and the staff was the best. however, they didn't do a couple of thing right that I specifically asked for and I had to a few times during the night remind them of a couple of things."
"129",5,"I worked a conference here video documenting the workshops. i came in late on Thursday, and didn't have the best exoerience at the bar, but they were trying to close. The next morning, the breakfast buffet was really good for 14.95. The place is older, but well maintained. The shuttle service was great. They took me to the very convenient light rail and to a restaurant. The A/V crew was also really good and respobsive."
"130",4,"Weekend getaway with children.  Hotel is very nice and clean.  Easy access to shopping and activities, especially when weather is not best - love having the ""link"" walkway to Union Station and Crown Center shopping."

"133",4,"On a two day layover to see my grandkids I stayed here in one of the King suites. I had originally booked a different cheaper hotel (Country Inn) but when I walked in to check on the rooms I decided to look for something else that also had an indoor pool since the CI suites had no window in the Living area. The space there was also very small. I am so glad that I then found the Drury Inn!! The atmosphere in the hotel was perfect for us. Friendly staff!! Yes the rooms were older but they are well equipped, very large and very comfortable. They are not at all nasty in any way so I do not understand the complaints from others. For the price you just cannot beat this hotel!! Lots of food - breakfast with lots of choices, snack in the afternoon (popcorn and free soda) and a food bar in the evening including FREE drinks. Simple foods but VERY acceptable! WE ALL HAD A FUN TIME HERE. The tween grandids really enjoyed the HEATED POOL. This was also a convenient enough location to make a midday trip to the fabulous Aquarium too. We did have a problem with our neighbor smoking in their room although this is clearly stated on signes throughout the hotel that this is a NON SMOKING HOTEL . Since the vents are connected in the rooms we were smelling the smoke. Both the grandkids are allergic to smoke and it really hurts my sinuses too. The staff moved us to our choice of a new room (not sure why the exhaust vents in hotels are now connected but just saw that in a Hilton I stayed in recently too). I will certainly stay here again on a quick layover to Atlanta. + FREE PARKING and FREE WIFI too!"
"134",3,"The front staff was friendly and helpful. She was able to accommodate me in a first floor room knowing I had twins and the hotel does not have an elevator. The room looks great. My only problem was that a roach crawled on my phone. After that I questioned the cleanliness of the room."
"135",4,"I stayed over cuz I had a work event on the same night as the Cubs being in the World Series and didn't want to drive back home. Worked for what I needed but word of the wise it's closer to Alexandria vs DC proper so plan accordingly. But staff was very helpful. I booked very last minute on hotels.com for a king bed but got two doubles which was a bit frustrating as I was a solo person but getting back from watching the game at 2am, I didn't really care enough to call down (I had only dropped my bags off in the room upon checking in and immediately walked out of the room)."
"136",3,"It is true that you get what you pay for, the hotel staff was very friendly, but the first issue was with the AC , the hallways are like a oven, they only have 2 window AC units on each end of the hallways, when you come out of your elevator or room it is like you are getting into a sauna, ( very uncomfortable), the water pressure is very poor, it is like you take a shower with a medicine dropper and if somebody flush the toilet the water is gone until the toilet tank stop refilling, the drain in the bath tub was plug, need to call maintenance to fix it, and for last when you check in they tell you that breakfast has one type of meat in a daily basis (bacon or sausage), on my 4 days stay not even one day the meat appeared. I can said this is the worst hotel I stay on the last few years I travel. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL, NOT EVEN FOR THE CHEAP PRICE."
"137",5,"Good: Loved the sound system in the room and the fact that they have coffee all the time!"

"146",4,"Our hotel room was spotless. The staff were so helpful and caring. They helped us out with our car. It's rare to find people who will help a stranger. We stay here frequently since my daughter goes to Chapman University. It's not in the most picturesque location, but everything else about it is great."
"147",1,"If you decide to book this hotel you will be disappointed."
"148",5,"Good location, slightly off main highway. All restaurant chains are convenient and if enough time to look, you can find good local restaurants. Excellent Staff. Fairly new facility, very clean. Highly recommended if you need to stay in the area.We are so pleased that your recent stay at the Hampton Inn in Gloucester was a good one! We look forward to a return visit from you!"
"149",5,"I have stayed here many times. It is always very clean, friendly, and affordable. Its a pretty new facility but the prices are still low. My favorite thing is that they don't have FOX NEWS on in the lobby so I don't have to listen to hate speech while I get my breakfast."
"150",5,"My plans to use my 2 free hyatt nights in Mexico fell through but time was running out so even though I thought I was going to be wasting them by staying at Hyatt House in Seattle, I didn't have a choice. As it turns out, I made an excellent choice. Though not a luxury hotel in Mexico, our visit to Hyatt House was wonderful! Check in was straightforward and easy (with the best service ever, but more on that later). Once we were moved (by request) out of the strange angled corner room with a view that looked out on another room, we were absolutely delighted with our stay!! The room was surprisingly quiet despite being next to the street and near the Seattle Center Activities. We loved the location, literally across the street from the Space Needle! The view of the Space Needle outside our window was romantic and the rooftop terrace provide an unparalleled 360 degree view of the city. The room layout was really cool and the decor is very modern (like a boutique hotel). The bed was very comfortable (firm but not hard). A (very) minor complaint is the textured fabric of the bedspread, which was a bit rough to the touch, but the sheets were crisp and smooth. Another minor detail was that I missed having a tub for soaking, but the rain shower turned out to be fine (lots of space in shower, could use a seat or shelf for sitting) Lots of storage space (as well as hangers) if you are staying a few days and want to unpack. The kitchen was fully stocked including dish soap, which seems unusual in hotels these days for some reason I don't understand. The free hotel shuttle was a great value and breakfast was decent- a pretty good selection though crowded on Sunday morning. he only thing that wasn't perfect about our stay was the fact that housekeeping never came the second day. We put the sign on the door and saw the housekeeper next door as we were leaving, but for some reason our room was skipped. It's always nice to come home to a freshened-up room and a made bed. We had enough towels to get us through, so it was fine, especially given that everything else was so good. Saving the best part for last, let me say that more than anything I have described, what we liked most by far, about our stay at Hyatt House, was the absolutely amazing service provided by Eden at the front desk! Everyone at the front desk was truly great, but she was a shining star! I'm not sure I've ever experienced a more genuine welcome or felt as appreciated as a customer as she made my husband and I feel. Thanks to her, this was a perfect weekend getaway!"

If you can stay here during the week it is actually pretty reasonable but it gets really expensive on weekends. Except for the cost however we found little to complain about. The staff is very attentive and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. My only complaint was that the breakfast, though good, was nothing special."
"163",4,"This hotel had great staff. They promptly got us checked in, helped us with information on Napa Valley wineries. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. Bed was very comfortable. Free internet met our needs. Hotel breakfast was vouchers for the Denny's on hotel property. That was nice to have a full breakfast. Property was clean. Our room was quiet (202) with minimal noise from hallway or street. We were able to get good nights rests. Love the microwave and empty frig in the room. Room rate was high due to us being there during an event that this hotel was associated with. So the limited supply and high demand rates were in effect.Katrina,We are glad you enjoyed your stay and it is always good to hear that my staff gave exceptional service. Hope to see you again on your next visit to Napa."
"164",5,"Das Mill's House Hotel ist fr mich ein typisches durchschnittliches Stadthotel. Das Zimmer war eher klein aber mit guten Betten. Die Einrichtung war hbsch, ausreichend und sauber. Da das Zimmer zum Innenhof lag war es sehr ruhig; der Pool war geschlossen, obwohl es zum Baden noch warm genug gewesen wre.Das Restaurant hatte die Grsse einer Bahnhofshalle und hat uns nicht zum Bleiben 'verfhrt'. Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger. Ich wrde vermutlich eher in Savannah ein Hotel suchen und lnger bleiben, und Charleston nur im Vorbeifahren besichtigen."

The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning. I was delighted that The Broome still uses both flat and fitted sheetsit is a must for a good nights sleep! The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. A good stay, indeed!Dear ECWPhD:On behalf of the team, thank you again for staying with us and thank you for sharing your feedback with us. It was a delight welcoming you into our little Oasis.

"185",5,"Great location: we wanted to find a hotel that was centrally located enough to not need a car, and the Hyatt House fit the bill. We flew into SeaTac Airport, took the light rail to downtown (Westlake stop) and took the Monorail to Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuly, Key Arena) which is right next the the Hyatt House. Great accommodations: the hotel seems brand new, extremely clean and modern, very spacious. Great staff: everyone was very nice and informative. We got to town about three hours before check-in and they let us check-in early. Great free breakfast: in addition to many choices, there is also a made-to-order omelet bar. Jay cheerfully made the omelets every day and they were excellent. And he would remember my name each day which is pretty amazing:) Other: they have a free shuttle which will take you where you want to go within a certain distance. The gym is not bad, although it is on street level with big windows, so you kinda feel like you are working out in a fish bowl. Great restaurants, coffee shops shopping within walking distance. About the only thing I didn't like was the parking - 25/day (we rented a car a couple days to visit the mountains) but there are cheaper parking lots within a block so it wasn't that big a deal. Check all the travel sites to compare prices - I found one that had the same room for 20 less a night than the rest. Overall the Hyatt House was an excellent choice for our Seattle vacation!Cushionhead,It was a pleasure accommodating you recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and we sincerely appreciate the glowing review!

"188",4,"This is a very nice hotel in a great downtown location. Accessible to all the attractions and very accommodating. I found it comfortable and clean. I like the complimentary drinks at the door and friendly staff. Our family really felt welcome and enjoyed this hotel the rooms were very relaxing."
"189",3,"Was an ok stay. Wish hotel had full size bathrooms, only had a sliding door with toilet and shower in it and sink outside of it.. very tiny and seemed less private. Had issue with stains on the sheets for one bed, but was able to have the front desk person change them since the maids were all gone.. otber... More"
"190",4,"I liked this hotel a lot. Service was friendly, suite was sizeable, clean, comfortable, with a decent view. Nice neighborhood with good nearby restaurants. The only issue I had was that the bed was too firm for my taste. Not too far from the airport and the mall."
"191",5,"Bad: Dont change a thing. Good: Staff was very accommodating even those we shared elevator rides with. Location was central and easy to walk places. We enjoyed our stay."
"192",4,"Staff was very friendly and accommodating . We would stay again"
"193",4,"Bad: The room wasn't the nicest. The air didn't get cool enough. Good: I liked the format of the room with a living area, kitchen and bedroom. The gym was great."
"194",3,"Overall this Best Western is nicely decorated. It was a bit disappointing that the bathroom did not function. A fairly busy property, so repairs were slow. The plus if you need or want to be close to 101. It is minutes from the freeway. Very convenient, if you are traveling to the Northern California's Redwoods or Sonoma/Napa."
"195",4,"Bad: The 'bathroom' area was open to the sleeping area. It was a unique design and certainly made the room seem larger. It was just a little odd. Also had to be careful about not hitting my head on the edge of the TV that was mounted on the wall between the sleeping area and the bathroom area. Good: The room was very spacious and the bed was quite comfortable. We were only there for the night but it was a pleasant stay."
"196",4,"Park right in front of your door! Rooms have flat screen, wifi, micro, fridge. However, no coffeemaker. A little on the high side compared to similar places we've stayed, but still reasonable. No ice machine either."
"197",4,"We have stayed at this hotel many times. I think it's great for families. My son loves the small arcade, bowling alley, movie theatre, pool and Friday's restaurant. I love the fact that the rooms are large, very clean and come with a small fridge. It is also great for families to have the shower and toilet area seperate. In addition to Friday's restaurant there are other restaurants including a 24 hour cafe and an ice cream shop that stays open late as well, very convenient. There are also shopping centers near the hotel that include just about every store and restaurant you can think of, Target, PF Changs, Mimi's etc. My parents had an odd numbered room and it overlooked the pool and golf course. My even numbered room overlooked a roof, not so nice. This is really the only negative I can think of. Also, pool area has no lifeguard or supervision of any kind, so some adults got a little unruly, drinking beer in the pool, speaking loudly etc. But, overall this is a nice place to stay off the strip, especially for those traveling to Las Vegas with children."
"198",5,"Unbeatable location next to Newbury street. Lovely clean, comfortable room with amenities . Generous continental breakfast. Coffee and tea always available (often with delicious cookies) Very friendly helpful staff. Very easy to come and go as they give you the code. Third time staying here.Thank you for your kind words. We always enjoy seeing you and your family! Looking forward to welcoming you again!"

"200",4,"Bad: There were a lot of little costs we weren't expecting - parking being a big one. Good: Location, size of room, indoor pool"
"201",4,"The hotel was clean and comfy. The first girl when we arrived at the front wasn't very helpful, we had a package with the water park next door and she seemed liked she really didn't have time to answer our questions.

"203",4,"Love this place. Fantastic housekeeping service, comfy beds, free parking, free cookies, coffee and lemonade in the lobby most of the day, free breakfast BUT the BEST part is the proximity to the park!

"206",5,"Close to Arlington Cemetery (15-20 minute walk)and Metro (10 min walk). Hotel is an older building but suitable for it's 2.5 star rating. Hi-speed internet in room was nice."
"207",3,"Overall, it was okay. First it was in a sketchy neighborhood. The hotel was old but clean. The room itself was nice. Comfortable king size bed with a fold out chair. They had a decent breakfast spread. I was disappointed to find that the boiler wasn't working, after I booked the room. No discount or compensation was offered."

"214",4,"Bad: Nothing. Good: Very friendly personnel at the reception. Breakfast was good lots of choices. Beds had excellent matrasses. Ony 10 minute drive to Disney parks. Lots of restaurants nearby."
"215",4,"The shuttle service was very convenient for concert goers, although the late return must have irritated to driver. He ran red lights, speedings, a little reckless. The hotel could use a coffee shop in the afternoons there only the bar open. It was a good location, Crown Center a block away. The Sheraton needs to get their name on the directories at the Crown Center to find the walkway."
"216",4,"I have to say that I was scare at first that my reservation was going to be denied, because there was many people with that problem before me. But when it was my turn, everything went well and actually because the hotel was full, they gave a better room for the same price. I was happy because it was comfortable and we had a great night of sleep after a very busy day."

"227",5,"I am a Hilton Diamond member and this is one of the best Hamptons I have stayed in for quite some time. The staff was wonderful and the hotel was very comfortable and not run down. The breakfast was plentiful and there was a good variety of items to choose from."
"228",5,"I was here for a single night and enjoyed every minute. Everyone here is personable and do what they can to ensure your every pleasure. After a stressful drive Teghan, Dean and Steve ensured I had an excellent dinner, good conversation and great drinks. I would stay here again."

"238",5,"Hampton Inn is the best hotel we've ever visited. The beds are so comfortable. The complimentary breakfast is delicious (and includes protein foods). The hotel staff is obviously carefully chosen and well trained. They were all very friendly and helpful. We felt so welcome. I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn to everyone."
"239",4,"We were in town for a Lego League Competition at UTEP. We reserved the hotel for the pool. And of course, it was closed for maintenance when we checked in. It did open the next day, but the pool was why we chose to pay 40 more per night. Service was ok- not outstanding, but not bad either. Just normal service. There were only about 10 channels on the TV and nothing for kids (so I had no pool or TV for the first night after a long day of work and traveling). But the hotel is close to a shopping center and not too far from UTEP so it worked well for what we needed."

Also need a direct phone line from the airport to hotel for shuttle service like other hotels and services. If I hadn't brought along the phone number, I would have been stuck. Wish there were other restaurants nearby. Also need a better selection of drinks for managers reception--I have stayed at many other Em. Suites and have had a much better selection--also bartenders were a little surly and the place wasn't really that crowded. Snacks catered to Vegans. Front desk personnel were extremely helpful--above and beyond the call of duty."
"251",4,"Check in was easy. Room was clean except that it appeared that the toilet was not flushed. All free coffee, bottled water, and bath essentials were fully stocked with clean linens and sheets. WiFi worked great."
"252",3,"My only issue is that I have expierienced better Wyndham hotels for cheaper prices in my area. Bigger rooms to bigger in-room jacuzzi units to better overall atmosphere to the room. Service or cleanliness was not lacking here just overall quality of rooms compared to other Wyndham hotels."

The mattresses were so comfortable and no evidence of bedbugs. The staff was great. The breakfast was delicious. I wish we could have stayed longer."
"259",5,"The propose of this hotel is that you would fell like home.

"261",1,"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"
"262",1,"When I checked in for my stay, the clerk could not even be bothered to get up out of her chair to do my paperwork. My room did not even have a shower curtain on my first night. The Super 8 was better."
"263",4,"The staff here was so nice and helpful. The room was clean and spacious. I would recommend staying here if I was in the area. The fitness room is very small so if it is booked you may have to wait for equipment."
"264",4,"Bad: There was an anti-noise device plugged into each of two sockets to compensate for the fact they are in a noisy road. In fact, this emits itself a loud roaring sound. When unplugged, things were fine. The road noise was not bad at all (we were on the 12th floor). One of the senior staff kindly refunded a breakfast bill given this and another issue (cordless phone by the bed wouldn't stop beeping through the night). The restaurant and room service were extremely expensive. There was a slight sense too that some of the decor (wood-appearance veneer on cabinets, shower curtain not panel ) was a bit cheap and scuffed given the price. Good: Staff were great - thoughtful, friendly and clearly dedicated to running it well.Decor and atmosphere of front lounge area welcoming and stylish. Location is very good."
"265",5,"Great place to stay if you want to go to DC The room was very good, we had a welcome gift waiting in our room which was very nice. The staff was very helpfull and gave us at check-in unasked very usefull info about the surrounding area and ways to travel within DC. Our room was on the opposite side of the highway and onthe 2nd floor with no highway noise. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is very good and the same everyday but there is enough of a variety. The shuttle will take you anywhere within 3 miles and to the DC Metro station, all you have to do is call and they will pick you up as well. The pool is very clean and all day there's a lifeguard, the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC!"

Coffee shop also served Starbucks coffee but had their own sandwiches which were really good and worth the price.

Nice beach area, pool and patio."

"288",5,"Perfect hotel for a single female traveller. The hotel was clean, convenient, and steps away from major attractions. Easy to access by public transportation. The room is smaller than average, but not too small, and the perfect size for a traveller who is not planning on spending much time in the hotel room anyway. Computers with internet access a plus. Friendly staff. The only gripe I had was the elevators...there are only two of them, so visitors can wait a while for them to arrive."
"289",1,"I try to be fair and objective in my TripAdvisor reviews, because I take others' reviews seriously when booking a hotel.

"291",3,"I have visited this hotel twice now. On the first, I enjoyed a king-size bed and a clean room however, on my second visit to this hotel I found that the bedspread had a visible stain on it as soon as I entered the door. The towels which were meant to be white didn't appear to have been bleached at all, so they were dingy. On the floor leading to the bathroom was a red stain which I cringe to imagine what it consisted of. Overall, the room wasn't as clean as the one I enjoyed on the first visit."
"292",5,"We had a wonderful time. Aloft was beautiful. The staff helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and the amenities were very good. The beds were very comfortable.

"297",4,"We stayed at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown for two nights. It is a convenient hotel with studio style rooms. It is well located right in front of the famous Space Needle. You have to walk about 15 minutes to Pike Place and the Centre but that is still very convenient. Breakfast was included, but we did not make use of it. They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay. Only thing: the elevators are ridiculously slow we stood down waiting for one car to arrive what felt like ages. And we are happy to spend our last night there as well on our way back home."
"298",5,"The Hotel Was Everything I Expected. Very Reasonable price, being that is 2 Blocks away from New Orleans French Quarter. This gave me the freedom to not worry about Parking or transportation to or from the party life of NOLA. I will continue to visit each and Everytime I come to Louisiana."

I had some additional requests on our arrival again all were met with great attitudes by the hotel employees. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. Though it is close to the highway, our rooms were in the front and below highway level, so noise was not at all a problem. The free breakfast is great, offering freshly baked waffles, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit, as well as the usual. Shuttle was always available during our stay and took us to restaurants as well as the Metro. We will definitely return when we visit the DC area again."

I made a reservation and when I got there It went so smooth I was up to my room in less than 5mins and I had a preference to check in at 11:00am and it was granted with no extra charge. The room was very nice and clean and smelled good. The shower I LOVED and the full body mirror I couldn't stay out of. The staff was very nice and friendly. The hotel was quiet which I was hoping because I know they let animals stay there. Overall we really enjoyed our stay my boyfriend agreed this was one of the best hotels we ever stayed at.WOW!!

Good: We got a great price though Booking.com at this awesome boutique hotel. Felt like we won the lottery. The decor in the lobby, bar and room was trendy. They have a game room with pool, shuffle board, ping pong, giant jenga, and a Wii. My boyfriend and I had it all to ourselves one night. We keep getting drinks from the bar and we had a blast. Didn't need to go out that night! We booked there because we wanted to be in walking distance of the Giants game at ATT park. Had a great time at the game even though Giants lost that one. We like the exercise room. They actually had more than just treadmills! We liked it because we like to lift weights and we were able to get a moderate workout. Book it!"

There is a popcorn machine in the lobby, which my kids loved. We also caught the staff setting out warm chocolate chip cookies in the evenings-YUM! Such a nice homey touch! The free breakfast was outstanding. We traditionally don't expect much from a hotel spread, but this one was the exception. Lots of selections, and the hot options changed from one morning to the next. Breakfast attendant was friendly and helpful, and kept everything well stocked as the crowd ebbed and flowed. The only negatives were an extremely loud family in the room above us that kept us awake until almost midnight. The hotel staff did they best to help and even offered to move us, but we opted not to take them up on the offer. Nothing else the staff could have done to help that situation. I was also disappointed that the hot tub wasn't working, but the kids had a wonderful time in the pool regardless."

They are actual blankets, not your typical hotel comforter. This would be okay IF the room wasn't a freezer. - This hotel does not care when you have issues with things which is unusual but at least other hotels try to improve your experience. - I got sick because the room was so COLD and since I had a sore throat the next morning I called for a late checkout and of course they couldn't do it.

We were there for 6 days and they did everything to make sure our stay was pleasurable. The restaurant is a great place to eat if you are too tired to venture out for dinner. The front desk has a great local restaurant list and the hotel van will drop you off and pick you up when you are finished eating. We loved the daily breakfast buffet and the evening manager's reception. The hotel is located about a block from the metro station. We enjoyed the daily walk to the station and found it very easy to get to all the sites we were they to see via the metro."

All the way from the staff that checked me in to the staff at the bar during happy hour. The shuttles are great if you dont have a car they will take you to/from the airport, to/from the mall and anywhere requested within a mile radius of the airport. The room its self can use a bathroom update but overall not too bad. The breakfast was great with cooked to order omelets. This hotel was worth every penny."
"349",5,"Short walk to conference at Minute Made Park, hotel being renovated and I was in a new room that was small but perfect for my needs with a Queen bed, desk and swivel chair, comfortable arm chair, good size shower in adequate size bathroom.

"354",3,"Booked for a convention over a Friday thru Saturday recently, It was prudent to reserve my stay on the premises, although my customer loyalty cards recommended the hotel across from the golf course. Prices were not as low as many reviewers state for this hotel, two weeks prior the event but relatively expensive Friday and Saturday night stays (almost double the workweek day rate - and almost all hotels do this in Las Vegas, some more than others). Flights expensive from the East Coast this year, Saturday return some 100 cheaper than flying back on Sunday - and the red eye flights leave close to the date changeover time.The next shock came finding out about getting there from and to McCarran Intl. airport - it's apprx. 17 miles in distance, taxicab 60...70 when arriving late night! But what the hotel staff did not readily disclose - ther's a low-key bus (WestCliff Express) for two (2) dollars, that takes about 50 minutes (while still running along the highways) and makes its final scheduled stop less than a quarter mile/400m from the hotel entrance! Other participants of the convention took out rental cars (the hotel shuttle, price not known, last leaves hotel or airport by 6pm, so you're out of luck on eastbound red eye flights, that's where the bus really pulls its weight...)Enormous lobby areas greet you and hefty puffs of cigarette smoke - almost like good ole Europe (used to be...). The area appears more cluttered (efficiently equipped) with money machines than in some other hotels on and off the strip, making it a challenge to find your orientation and the concierge area, at first.Yes, the personnel really is friendlier here than in town, instead of the allocated room on the third floor, I requested one on a higher level and was granted one with an outstanding view of the golf course and the mountains. Clean room, with separate sink area vs shower/toilet area, albeit fixtures telling their heritage closer to the 80s than the 2000s. A flat screen TV (not HD)with a very limited program but a few music channels that are worth mentioning (and I couldn't turn it off at the end of a two night stay, not via remote or on the mainframe!) The biggest drawback were the enormous 4 AC motors below (the size of B757 engines) and their significant noise when at least two of the four fans were continuously running - mind, we had 107F (40C) outside temps during the day...Too bad, despite the weekend room rate surcharge, wi-fi was available only at another surcharge of 12,99/day, and amazingly, I managed without. No group discount (considering the conference) had been negotiated.A very opulent breakfast bar greets the all-nighter not before 8am on weekends, keep your gambling registration card handy as it will give you 2 meal discount, but prices are really reasonable for Las Vegas, the quantity or the quality. Likewise the prime rib dinner buffet, good job, guys! Please tip the friendly staff like Easterners...A solid good, not quite very good and I decisively wish to criticize the very draughty, excessively chilled conference rooms on the second floor (near the bingo hal) with no possibility of adjusting climate control clearly spells out that this hotel isn't latest generation any more.Would I recommend it heat-soaked LA drivers might find their sanctuary here, it's not close to the strip, but if you don't need access to downtown daily and are a little more cost conscious, this might just be your choice for a few days. Good luck in winning a jackpot!"

Everything was plugged into an extension cord. Good: Location and parking."

Jennifer, the General Manager, and her entire staff went out of their way to accommodate us on a number... More"
"378",5,"Good: helpful friendly staff, excellent location, clean, light beautifuly decorated rooms, comfortable bathroom (normal shower with a shower hand! :) ), pool that you can almost have for your own use as there were not many people using it."
"379",5,"Easy access location (pretty easy from BWI and rental car facility too), great shopping very close, excellent complimentary breakfast, has great bed and pillows (imho). Great value for price in this area."
"380",3,"Was a little Leary at first because this is a Wyndham property my last experience with their property was a Microtel and it was disgusting! This was a pet friendly hotel and the rooms were clean, they served not much of a Continental breakfast. They used styrofoam bowls plates we all know you are not suppose to use... More"
"381",5,"Everything was 5 star! Beautiful granite, exceptional bed and a quiet night."
"382",5,"We were trying to check in and even though they had our reservations, they had no rooms. The customer service agent went above and beyond to help us as there really was no room at the inn. They eventually were able to secure a room"
"383",4,"I was VERY nervous about choosing this hotel because of the negative reviews. But we were pleasantly surprised! A group of friends and I (girls, early 20s) stayed here on Saturday 12/28 and our total room cost was 115. We chose Rodeway because it was only a mile away from Bader Field where Life in Color was. The rooms were very clean! Outdated, but clean. Beds were actually pretty comfortable! Didn't use the TV. The bathrooms were also very clean. The shower's water pressure wasn't the best, but we dealt with it. Check in and check out went very quickly and smoothly. Not the friendliest people, but they got the job done. We found a place to park right outside of our room which was great. Parking is 10 which is annoying but you have to pay to park ANYWHERE in Atlantic City so I didn't mind. Anything beats paying 700 a night at Revel (that was their rate on the same night!!!). We were barely in our room all night, so this hotel is perfect for a group of friends who are just looking for a place to shower, pregame, and sleep. I wouldn't recommend this place to a couple only because it's not really romantic or anything. It's very basic, which is what we were looking for. There is a free breakfast but of course we didn't wake up early enough (ends at 10), however there was still fresh, hot coffee at 12pm when we checked out which was nice. This place is definitely NOT a 5-star hotel, but it's also not bad either. And no, we didn't see any hookers!"
"384",5,"Bad: Expensive of course, wish the hotel restaurant was more reasonably priced because we wanted to go but couldnt justify. Good: Bed was great and the staff was so genuinely kind"
"385",5,"Omni Royal Orleans offered convenient location, and loads of amenities. The staff is gracious and really makes you feel at home from the second you arrive outside the front entrance. There is a restaurant downstairs where we had an excellent meal, and the lobby bar was fun and relaxing for cocktails. For American standards, the room is small. If you... More"
"386",3,"There are not many places to stay in this area, so this place is a good place for the night. It certainly beats the lower-priced hotels/motels that are usually offered in remote areas. The room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. There was a buffet breakfast offered in the morning for only 8.75, but after eating it, I wished we would've held out for a Cracker Barrel or even Dunkin' Donuts."
"387",4,"Good new option for hotels in Napa. Centrally located near new retail center south of downtown Napa. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Very typical Hampton Inn room setup. Nothing special, but reasonable alternative to other hotels in the area. Dear P5041IYwilliamk,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your feedback. There are several options for hotels in Napa and we love to provide our guest with a Hampton value of complementary internet, complementary parking, complementary breakfast, our added features of pool and spa as well as a nice patio area with a fireplace and 2 fire pits which not all Hampton's have. We thank you again for your feedback and hope to see you again on your next trip to Napa Valley. Best Regards, Serina Najar."
"388",4,"Book this room on the spur of the moment trip...service was excellent and would definately go back!"
"389",4,"We visited to be close to the theatre and inner harbor. We had a pleasant stay and were close to our planned activities. I would recommend to others."
"390",4,"I liked the Hotel overall and what it had to offer,but the beds were not comfortable! and I couldn't get HOT WATER in my room when I took a shower or control the AIR TEMP in my room w/the AC unit..it still felt warm night .I did like the FREE SHUTTLE to Discovery Kingdom and the driver was very... More"
"391",5,"With a group to tell others about the love of Jesus Christ! Sleep well and great breakfast!"
"392",4,"Bad: There was no complimentary bottle of water. If you need water, you need to buy from the mini bar. For the breakfast, wish there were more hot food. Good: Liked the fact there was breakfast on every floor and enjoyed the drinks in the evening."
"393",5,"I have stayed at this location in the past and every time it gets better. The staff is friendly and helpful. The was clean and comfortable. The layout of the room was very comfortable. The breakfast was hot and ready. The food was fresh. The location is well located."
"394",5,"First time to stay at a My Place hotel. Stayed overnight on our way to Yellostone. Beds and bedding were wonderful! Room was clean and reasonably priced. Allows pets and had sufficient walking area. Will look for them again. However, no king beds."
"395",5,"Everything was just lovely. The managers were friendly and helpful. The room was large and had everything we needed. The pool was clean and nice and the beach access was great. I wish we could've stayed longer!"
"396",2,"Staff was friendly and informative... However... Room was a little dirty. Curtains were severly stained and carpet was filthy. Walked around with socks and within a few steps to the bathroom socks were black. Smelled humid and hallway was dirty."
"397",1,"Probably the worst ever. Incredibly distasteful. No hot water. Inoperable phone in room. Overcharged for parking. Deceptive pricing. No bathroom in room. Discourteous staff. The list goes on and on. The hotel itself isn't so bad, and it's in a very good location. It could be a nice place, and looks like a quaint old hotel. Don't understand the way... More"
"398",5,"Bad: Expensive parking. Good: Corner room"
"399",5,"No need to look anywhere else when staying in Louisville! For the price, proximity to YUM Center and the beautiful views of the river, it's the best deal going! Cafe Magnolia (2nd floor) is a great casual restaurant. Thelma's Deli is perfect for fruit, sandwiches, pizza, breakfast biscuits, etc."
"400",4,"Bad: Young girl on front desk was very abrupt. Good: For us the location was great,a nice 10 min walk to the strip. Nice clean rooms. Nice pool and hot tub."
"401",5,"This place is just a pleasure in every way. Great staff, great rooms and great location. The hotel runs a shuttle to the airport which is really convenient. I love the gym and restaurant. In the heart of Bend and convenient to shopping, etc."
"402",3,"The hotel stay was great other then check in. The girl at check in was very rude which started off the stay their unpleasant. The room was very clean and comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was great."
"403",3,"While making coffee one morning and trying to iron a shirt, the circuit tripped. The sad part was that the GFI was at the END of the electrical run, not the beginning, so I had to call down to the front desk and wait for someone to reset the circuit at the electrical panel. I shouldn't have blown in the first place, but it also should be re-wired properly."
"404",5,"Stopped here en route to Florida from Ontario. Great location and the property remains in good condition. Lots of amenities nearby. The breakfast lounge area is clean and well kept. Our room was clean and quiet and gave our family of four (toting A LOT of stuff) enough room We stayed on a very busy night - but the staff... More"
"405",3,"Ok experience nothing special except when the power went out in the morning and stayed out for a few minutes."
"406",5,"With the movie theater, kids babysitter facility,bowling alley, swimming pool, casino, etc this was a very nice place, only 15 minutes from the strip. kid friendly swimming pool (which also had a pretty lively weeklly adult pool party) was nice. large clean rooms accomodated 4 people easily. the st tropez buffet food was very good and moderately pricedwe would definitely stay there again. a large shopping mall and other stores are less than 5 minutes away. beatiful view of both the strip at night and the mountains from our room. we also looked out over the pool area and a golf coursethe fitness center was just that. not a bike and treadmill like some places. they had treadmills, elliptical trainers and bikes as well as several weight machinesspa on site but i didnt get to try it out unfortunatelygive it a try and i know you wont be disappointed"

"408",5,"We found Indigo through searching on Trip Advisor. We were looking for a unique, boutique type hotel with competitive rates. We loved this hotel! It was definitely competitively priced and significantly cheaper than the big flags downtown. But the value is amazing! Big, spacious rooms an enormous, wonderful shower comfortable bedding clean throughout warm and friendly staff great breakfasts (complimentary)... More"
"409",4,"Great service and ease in location - it didn't seem walkable to restaurants though but it was easy enough to drive. Good breakfast bar!"
"410",4,"Never expected to get a bigger space for our family vacation. All rooms are equipped with needed things and yes, my family enjoyed every moment of the stay ar Virginian Suites. Only thing was not expected was the internet speed, it was slow, slow on that day, probably!"
"411",5,"Bad: The hotel cannot control the metal plate in the road that bangs when cars drive over it all night. Good: The bed was very comfortable and the berries and fresh fruit were awesome! The staff was friendly and more than made up for a mishap with the room reservation."
"412",1,"We paid 339.00 plus 50.00 tax for a room that faced a busy to lane road..plus the entrance to the hotel...and dumpster across the street. Not a the stunning view of Sedona. I was told that those rooms were another 30.00 more. I travel a lot and in all honesty this hotel...is trying to be something it is not. I... More"
"413",5,"The front desk associate Brad was great, I really enjoyed my check-in and check-out through him. The buffet breakfast was also a great deal that I included in my package and if your traveling with kids the kiddie pool was pretty cool too."
"414",5,"Awesome free breakfast with different hot items each day like bacon, eggs, sausage, hash browns. Waffles, oatmeal, cereal, muffins, yogurt, etc. Kids loved the nice pool and enjoyed getting hot chocolate."
"415",5,"Great hotel. So much more character than staying in one of the big chain hotels. The building was a transformed warehouse, so walls are old brick, floors are resurfaced wood, etc. Very Cool. Super helpful staff. Great coffee shop restaurant downstairs. Definitely will return."
"416",4,"Da wir nur eine Nacht in Charleston bleiben konnten, war es uns wichtig m√∂glichst zentral im Herzen des ""Historic Charleston"" zu wohnen. Die Lage ist auch wirklich super. Auch sonst hatten wir nichts an dem Hotel auszusetzen, obwohl die Fotos vielleicht ein bisschen mehr vermuten lassen als tats√§chlich dahinter ist und auch das Wort ""Grand Hotel"" etwas hochgegriffen ist.Das Zimmer war gro√ü und sauber, dasBett bequem, das Personal freundlich und entgegenkommend, die Lage super."
"417",5,"This is a delightful hotel. We were deciding between this and The Spectator when booking, and chose this because of the pool and the promise of a little more room than a standard room, at a significantly lower price than rooms at the Spectator were going for at the time. We were very happy. Our welcome was warm, they got... More"
"418",5,"Bad: Wish we were told about the 20 discount at the restaurant next door upon our arrival. Only saw the sign as we were checking out... Good: Friendly staff and great appetizers free from 5-8! Clean room and free wifi! Excellent!"
"419",4,"We stayed here last year about this time to catch an early flight out of Pittsburgh. You can tell that the hotel is in the process of being renovated. Our room was done and looked great. The outside of the hotel was also being painted. The shuttle driver told us that the hotel was recently under new management and a lot of items that were left by the former management is now getting done."
"420",5,"Good: It was located just off the strip and easy access to everything can't go wrong!!!"
"421",5,"Not only is this a great motel, it is also a Route 66 historic icon! The staff is super friendly and service is great. This is my choice hotel when staying overnight in Springfield, MO! If you stay in Springfield then this is the place for you, your family, associates and friends!"
"422",2,"I've never been to a hotel where I had to pay to park in the facilty. 36 a night was ridiculous, the food tasted like it was for a school breakfast, the hotel for being in the downtown area looked worst than any hood I ever was in. They removed more money than they were supposed to thinking I wasn't going to notice, I was supposed to get a discount rate and they tried not to apply it. The pool and the fitness room was cool. the hotel was clean."
"423",4,"Great location to visit Sedona. Hotel offers great views of the mountains all around the city and good facilities. Rooms are what you should expect from a hotel of this type. Being very central, you have very easy access to restaurants and shopping."
"424",4,"Service is excellent for a midlevel chain motel. Good location right off Hwy 54. Usually decent rates. Room design and cleanliness are just average, but you can't have everything for a midtier price. Location and typically excellent service more than make up for any shortcomings."
"425",4,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and the service is always excellent and the property is well keep. I am concerned about security whenever I travel. This property has twenty four hour security and the location is perfect for those who want access to Dallas, Grand Praire, Arlington or Fort Worth"
"426",5,"The atmosphere of the hotel was excellent! Every staff worker that I encountered was extremely friendly and helpful! They were very informative as well in terms of the early continental breakfast that they serve and were all the amenities are located! The fitness center and the indoor heated pool and jacuzzi were very clean as well as my room. Overall, this was an enjoyable stay for me and I highly recommend this hotel to others. You will definitely be satisfied!"
"427",5,"Bad: More restaurants. Good: Very friendly staff."
"428",5,"It was wonderful."
"429",5,"For its price point, Best Western Walla Walla is really pretty awesome. It's a short walk to downtown, the rooms have an upscale decor and are very comfortable and clean, the beds are excellent, the front desk is helpful, and the free breakfast is not bad at all (decent selection by current standards -- which are admittedly not very high...

"430",4,"We were very happy to have found this place on short notice. No frills, but no hassle either! It could use some paint on the outside, but the inside was clean, functional and exceeded our expectations. Not too far from downtown. We would go back."
"431",5,"This was a very nice hotel. Even' with its location near downtown, it was very nice and very clean. I would recommend this hotel highly to anyone traveling to Lexington. The fitness center was great!!"
"432",5,"Stayed during high season in Phoenix. Not super chi-chi, but super solid. Impeccably clean room, clean lobby, clean grounds. Friendly staff. Cheesecake Factory walking distance a bonus. :-) Easy to get to from Phoenix ingress on Highway 60 from East. Great."

"434",3,"Stayed two nights in late April. The parking is a little confusing as it is shared with the hotel next door and could use more lighting. The attendance was very pleasant when checking in. The manager was very helpful in the morning pulling additional chairs for the folks to be able to sit in the crowded breakfast area. Clean place.... More"
"435",1,"one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. Could not wait to leave in the mornings. As it was memorial weekend the pickings were very slim."
"436",1,"Unfortunately this hotel had no sound barriers between floors. Noise from upstairs was constant and I did not sleep at all. Bathroom shower surround was damaged and doors were dirty. The best positive was that the room was clean and updated."
"437",5,"The location for this hotel is great right in the middle of the North End and close walking distance to Faneuil Hall, etc. modern efficient with large TV and electric fireplace. Very nice bathroom with standup shower but lacking in horizontal surfaces for toiletries."
"438",4,"This is an excellent place to stay while in Morgantown. The rooms are spacious and clean. One shortcoming is a lack of a refrigerator in room. they do charge for covered parking. Valet paring is available. the restaurant in the hotel is very good. The exercise room is the best equipped I have ever seen in a hotel, it rivals... More"
"439",5,"Stayed here 4 nights and were very pleased. Rooms were clean and well appointed.. It was comfortable and quiet. Also very close to everything. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Good breakfast. Would not hesitate to return."
"440",5,"WiFi was not any good. Everything else, was enough for the price."
"441",3,"Had to call maintenance man to fix shower. More water going out of diverted than shower head. They did fix it. Heard people walking in room above us. No counter space around sink."
"442",5,"My husband and I just returned from a 3 night stay. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and it was our first time visiting NOLA.

"444",4,"Up to HGI standards. Expensive bar drinks but comfortable and close to I10. Quality breakfast (free to Diamond members) Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff throughout. Great accommodations for the price and close enough to FSU campus."
"445",3,"The area and hotel was packed due to the fall leaf season.

"451",3,"We had a great stay at the Ritz in Pentagon City however it was not without a few faults. First on our first night we attempted to order room service which was supposed to be available 24/7 however after letting the phone ring for over five minutes without any one answering.... Twice we tried calling the concierge and got the same lack of response so we gave up and went to bed hungry. The other issue was with the shower. The water pressure from the bath tub faucet was fine and the water was hot but on e you switched it to shower there was so little flow that it would take forever to rinse shampoo out of your hair. I eventually resorted to switching back to the bathtub faucet and used one of the glasses to rinse my hair filing it from the bathtub faucet. The next night I decided I would just take a bath instead of standing in the sprinkle of the shower however the bathtub stopper would not deal off enough to even get more than 1 inch of water in the tub. To get by I used that came glass to cover the drain and it worked well enough after I wrapped a wash cloth around the base to help seal it off. I know these seem like small first world problems, but when you are staying at the Ritz there is a certain expectation of quality"
"452",5,"Great location to sites in Charleston. Easy to walk to historical sites and shopping. Breakfast cafe in hotel. Cheese and crackers pre dinner and cookies in the evening. Welcoming and helpful staff. Free on site parking."
"453",5,"We stayed here in November and had a wonderful stay. The restaurant, room service, bar and spa are amazing! Worth every penny and a place to experience! The shrimp and grits breakfast item is amazing!"
"454",5,"Loved it - I had not stayed in one of these before. I'll definitely use this hotel again."
"455",4,"Stayed here with 3 girlfriends white we shopped at the outlet mall. Front desk is very accommodating, the food is good, beds are comfortable and rooms are clean. The towels are crummy - small starchy - I would bring my own if I stayed again"

"457",5,"Rigtig godt hotel Super sdt personale Ca15min fra stranden"
"458",3,"Stayed one night at this Best Western for a half marathon the next morning. Overall, hotel gave the impression of being slightly dingy and outdated and was the type of hotel where all the rooms are accessed from an outdoor hallway. The service was friendly and helpful and the room was relatively clean and comfortable enough. Some stains on the carpet at the door though. Did not eat the breakast since we were up early for the race but I saw at check in that the dining room spilled out into the lobby which I thought was a little crowded looking to say the least. Great location as it was close to the plethora of wineries nearby and also close to several shopping and dining areas. Close to major highways without being noisy too. Next time I'd search for a slightly nicer hotel but this visit was satisfying for our needs."
"459",4,"We rented 1 bedroom plus den from vrbo . Great resort with condos with a feel of a hotel. Many pools, BBQ, dukes restaurant on site, ocean front, great snorkeling off the beach.

"460",2,"Initially a was quite satisfied with this hotel until checkout time, I proceeded to the room containing the continental breakfast which was miniscule to say the least.

THE VOLUME CONTROL OF THE TV DIDN'T WORK. THE HALL WAY TO OUR ROOM WAS EXTREMELY COLD. I WILL NEVER STAY AT AN EXTENDED STAY HOTEL EVER AGAIN. ALSO, NO POOL."

"484",4,"The hotel was good, not great. I didn't feel pampered - but I was comfortable (I think it supposed to be a 4 star hotel). The nice thing is that its close to the shopping mall which has a grocery store on the lower level! The mall also has a great food court also you can easily stock your room. The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. I would stay here again. However!!!! Get rid of the 7.00 charge to use the sauna, it's ridiculous moreover, they can't possibly be making any 'real' profit off of a 7.00 dollar charge."

"486",4,"We stayed with our two large dogs in the unit with the kitchenette. It was actually a very large one-bedroom apartment! Located above the office, it had a partial view of the ocean. Even with the two big dogs, we probably didn't need quite that much room. Great walking trail that the dogs loved just steps away. Office gave us... More"
"487",3,"It was an intermediate stop on a long journey, so there was not much chance to enjoy the area or spend time in the room. The front desk staff was very accommodating."
"488",2,"Paying full price while hotel is under construction is not acceptable...newly renovated room was mediocre at best...room only had one chair...no lounge chair ...previously provided when staying there...furniture was cheaply built and made...cleanliness of room was at best just acceptable...found things left behind by former guests...dirty floor...bed was comfortable however...breakfast was just OK...nothing to rave about and certainly not a selling point for me to stay there...staff was very friendly and informative however...would hesitate to stay there again...very disappointing for sure..."
"489",2,"Location is great for Metro boarding to DC. No one at the front desk at check-in or check-out. Hallways/stairwells do not smell good at all.

"491",5,"I highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay. It's situated in Arlington a quieter,more idealic area than Washington dc itself although still very easy to visit all the attractions in DC via a short walk to Rosslyn, it's nearest metro.Hotel room was amazing value for money,very clean with a separate kitchen area.There is no hotel restaurant available and thekitchen was more than adequate to cook decent meals in. Our only complaint is that our gas cooker did not work and after mentioning it to the hotel it was never sorted out so we spent 2 weeks without a working cooker.As there is not much in the surrounding area we found ourselves having to travel into rosslyn and Washington to buy dinner."
"492",5,"Be sure to try the Landmark. Best breakfast we've found in the area. Great food and great service! We make sure to stop here we go to camp."
"493",1,"It was awful We went for one night as we were grieving and needed to get away First of all the 35 parking fee was ridiculous and your parking attendant sneered at us and said This IS La Jolla. Wow. When I asked the front desk what was the deal with the parking it was just uh yeah sorry. The room 808 was just OK. Altjough we were kept awake by some shenanigans going on in The room above us ALL NIGHT We will not be returning and regret we booked this room in our grief. It did nothing to help."
"494",4,"Bad: Very noisy at night (24h party directly below the rooms in the other building, traffic). We didn't stay in the main building, we weren't informed before. So please check before, otherwise there's not much sleep possible. Good: Next to Ocean Drive, so the beach is over the street. Room was huge and clean. Valet parking was very fast (39/d), staff was friendly. Also the roomservice was fast and delicious."
"495",4,"Bad: N/a. Good: Everything good"
"496",5,"Very highly recommended. Outstanding staff. Great location. Spacious rooms with very comfortable beds. Tastefully and creatively decorated public areas and rooms. Restaurant very good as well. Stands out as a unique and exceptional vacation experience."

"501",2,"I guess they don't care about the little critters that creep around the room. We informed the front desk and all they said was, hum. We usually have the rooms sprayed! Found two centipedes and spiders crawling around."
"502",3,"The room, staff, and chocolate bar were all great. The only issue was on Fridays and Saturdays the hotel hosts noisy events (such as proms) in their conference rooms, which open onto the atrium as do most of the rooms, which does not make for a quiet evening."
"503",5,"I was extremely happy with the location of the hotel, it is located in the heart of historic Charleston with everything within walking distance. The hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and the decor was charming."
"504",5,"Just needed an overnight stay and it was right off the belt way. Very nice place for the price to be honest. Very close to metro and off the main road so you don't see much traffic either."
"505",5,"Renovated room was very nice. My request regarding a room on the first floor and close to where I would unload... handicap if possible... was met in all respects. Breakfast was hot and fresh, with all the usual items! Personnel were friendly and helpful:-)"
"506",5,"Bad: Supposed to get call when room was ready. Did get a text but only to text if I needed assistance. Not really much of a problem as timing between eating and room being ready before evening event worked out. Good: Within walking distance to evrything we did. Parking adjacent to motel. Have stayed"
"507",5,"Bad: When I made the reservation, they told me one thing. When I got there, the first person told me something different. Third person resolved it. Good: The staff was excellent!!initially I didn't get the room I asked for when I made the reservation. They wasted no time correcting the situation. Made my birthday stay very pleasant! Excellent location."
"508",5,"Bad: air conditioner was a quite noisy when it came on."
"509",5,"This is a great deal. The amenities are awesome and include a cocktail hour with a hot bar. The location is ideal, and the staff is excellent. The building is well maintained and the rooms are spacious, comfortable, and attractive."
"510",5,"We had a couple of days to spend in Chicago and wanted a hotel close to our car rental and to a train station, this place fit the bill. It's right in the middle of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to pretty much everything. It wasn't too cheap compared to normal hotels but all the other hotels close by were a lot more expensive so it felt like a good deal.It's a very simple lobby with just a couple of people in the reception and you could check in via a touch screen. There was a restaurant right next by but we didn't try it. There's plenty of restaurants and shops everywhere close by anyway.We ordered a room with two beds because of our kid and was expecting two beds close together, but we got a huge room which was pretty much two rooms in one with a hallway in between. It had two TVs and two bathrooms. I don't know if we just got lucky and got the biggest room they had for that price or if they're all like that. It was a great surprise for us and our kid could even play hide and seek with us!"
"511",4,"THis is second time I've stayed here. Good bang for the buck."
"512",5,"No1 stay very comfortable. Please change pillows made sleeping very hard."
"513",4,"Shoney's is right next door and the Carroll's General Store is just a quick drive behind the motel. This made all the difference in the world."
"514",4,"Bad: How crowded the lobby seemed, mostly with locals having a stance putting out a I'll kick your ass before I move aura. Good: The overall atmosphere was clean and modern, easy to navigate to facilities I needed over stay."
"515",3,"did not meet my expectations at all! I've stayed with this chain before and was impressed, but not this time! The eggs on the breakfast buffet were inedible and the staff disorganized and not prepared to deal with a crowd. Our room was not cleaned, ever. I had to call for clean towels. We used the hot tub, which wasn't hot, had weak bubbles and had tile missing. We ordered a movie and although the screen said we would be charged 14.99+tax, we were charged 17.99+tax. A complete ripoff!"
"516",5,"Staff very friendly and check in was fast and efficient. Breakfast was one of the best I have seen at a motel Very clean place all around, from room to breakfast area. Very close to Lambert's Cafe which is a destination restaurant. If you are in this area STAY HERE, you will not be disappointed."
"517",4,"I usually stay at the HI Express, but their rate was way too high for me this time. This hotel was just fine. Like other Comfort Inns, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, TV had enough channels, and there was a decent breakfast. I will probably come back again."

Maybe because it's one of the newer ones, but I will admit I like their ambiance. The location is great, it's right by... More"
"519",3,"Good location and generally comfortable hotel, albeit somewhat cramped. Close to international restaurants of Silver Spring and short walk to Metro for access to all of DC. Room/hotel was clean and pleasant but showing age in some facilities. Friendly and helpful staff - very accommodating."
"520",5,"We had an extremely pleasant stay at the Virginian Suites Hotel. Like staying in an apartment it was so spacious. The hotel is convenient to everything and within walking distance to the metro which I did because the traffic was so bad most mornings I could beat the hotel transport. Everything was clean and they even have a breakfast. We would stay here again. Also very quiet for sleeping."
"521",5,"Good: Bar had a good atmosphere, room was really cute."
"522",2,"A typical Hampton Inn. Two issues, however. Located at an exit that has no town around it...just 2 other motels restaurants, gas, etc. 1or 2 exits. The most bothersome feature is that the approach is a very dark road which turns out is a divided parkway with nothing but a few short white stakes to mark it. We ran up... More"
"523",5,"The breakfast had a little to be desired. And we weren't told when it ended, so when we showed up there was very little, if anything left. But the staff and facilities were very nice and clean. I would probably stay there again"
"524",1,"Free parking. That's the only positive experience here. Any more than 1 night would have canceled found different hotel. Hotel had a funky smell in lobby and room was musty smelling too. Good thing the air conditioner was good and loud it blocked the street noise. Stayed at few holiday Inn express and they've been decent. Not so much here and they charge more rooms at the big H.I. Overall impression...not impressed."
"525",4,"Very friendly front desk staff. Clean comfortable lobby and sitting area. Great breakfast. Make your own waffles, biscuits, gravy, bacon, eggs. The rooms nice and spacious.

"526",5,"We hadn't stayed at the St. Regis for many years. We decided to try it again for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had reserved. It was a beautifully appointed room with all the modern amenities. It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location. You step out of the hotel and you're in the middle of a shopper's paradise. Every designer store is at your doorstep. So if you want to shop till you drop it's a great location. You're also steps away from Central Park and all the wonderful museums we have in New York City.The St. Regis has it all, great service, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. Looking to return soon to enjoy being in the city!Dear MissS85, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your special occasion.

"527",4,"Bad: The construction next door."
"528",2,"Hotel was fine, big room, great view...but having to pay for WiFi, after paying so much for a room, as well as free WiFi for non-residents in the lobby? Over priced restaurant and bar, the top view is only for VIP guests, loads of people attending a conference over everywhere.....wouldn't stay here again. Disappointed after paying so much money then being asked to pay more for the basics...especially with the more attractive alternatives nearby."
"529",5,"This hotel was wonderful. The views were amazing and everyone was so nice. We even had one of the maintenance men stop traffic to let us out of the parking lot (Gatlinburg traffic is not fun). This hotel was a great location to everything.

"530",4,"The breakfast had only waffles, nothing else!"
"531",5,"The hotel is ideally located in center city across the street from Reading Terminal market. They did a nice job modernizing this hotel. It is also very clean. Check in was great. I was in town for the night and booked a room last minute. I had 4 adults in one room and when I booked the only available option was 1 queen and 1 sofa bed in a room. I asked if they have any rooms available with 2 beds and they were able to accommodate me last minute which was great. Also at checkin they provided 2 cold bottles of water which was a nice touch. The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door. The pool was simple and on the smaller side. Parking like every other hotel is expensive and you will find better options searching on your phone to park yourself. The complimentary breakfast was solid, they offer waffles,yogurt, juice, prepackaged omlets and breakfast sandwiches that were very good. I have been to Philly many times over the years for Eagles games and stayed at 20+ hotels in the city and Home2 Suites would definitely be in my top 3. I highly recommend it!Dear Matthew,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

"537",4,"This hotel is not within walking distance of the downtown Napa restuarants and shops, but it is within walking distance of several chain restuarants, stores and a movie theater. It served us well since we had a car and spent most of the day exploring the vineyards. They offer cereal bars, juice and coffee in the morning and you receive a discount at the Dennys next door. We would stay here again, mainly because of the cost benefit.Gregory K - Thank you for the great review. We are thrilled you enjoyed your stay and please come see us again soon!"

"545",3,"First it looks like something happen in the beach and a bunch of dead fish are laying on the sand, as soon as the sun comes out the smell is extremely bad. Secondly the rooms are set not to allow the AC to lower below 70 that made the room uncomfortable and third we where in the room for three days and the minibar wasn't re-stocked or was the sugars for the coffee maker or tea, it looks like only one elevator was working and it took forever!"
"546",5,"Bad: We were on the 9th floor and slept really well but could hear the metro. Earplugs are supplied which were useful to my husband. There were two tvs in our one bedroom suite but only one remote control - odd when we wanted to watch two different shows. Good: Absolutely perfect location in Chicago, within one block of the metro, walking distance to most of the top areas to visit and very good restaurants. Very comfortable room and bed, neat layout for the closet and vanity, wonderful shower, cool design features (Vespa chair, red fridge, furniture)."

"554",5,"Bad: I think the hotel could do more to promote the on site restaurant with newly arrived guests. My husband tried it and thought the food was great but if there'd been a deal or something to catch our attention I'm sure we'd have eaten breakfast there both mornings of our stay. I also think that although the space inside the rooms seems to be well used that there are some practical challenges with storage where existing space could be better used for the ease and comfort of guests. Good: Very comfortable beds. Not massive but cosy and we all slept well. The linens were clean and fresh and we enjoyed the L'Occitane products in the bathroom. The staff were friendly, kind and helpful."
"555",5,"Outstanding hotel, location not as convenient as I remembered with respect to fast food restaurants for that quick bite to eat. Very quiet area (well, it is dead of winter), but just the same we enjoyed the peace and quiet."

"557",4,"Bad: The Wi-Fi works with a portal login, I had to log-in like 5 times each day for every device I was using, even if I hadn't left the room. Super annoying and I'd say enough reason for any business traveller to avoid an otherwise super nice hotel. Good: The hotel is super stylish, the room was perfect. The hotel feels new clean throughout. Nice atmosphere in the bar area."
"558",5,"Location great. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see. Room great. Staff very helpful. Lee, the lovely lady who first saw us when we booked in couldn't have been more helpful.

"561",3,"WE stayed at the Washington DC site and the staff was not accomidating to people who had never been in the DC area before. We asked for direction and way of getting around and they were very disinterested in helping us (there were 9 of us). When we went down to the continental breakfast we were asked where our coupon for brekfast was we asked if our room key would do she said no. We went down to the front desk got the coupon went back up and she said okay you have it but NEVER even looked at it we could have shown her a fake card she would have never have known she jsut made it inconfience for us to eat. Beware that if they say you can walk somewhere that it will only take you 20 minutes plann for 45 to hour they have no sense of time or distance."
"562",5,"Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. This hotel has the best redemption for SPG points value, and we took advantage to pamper ourselves. It was really very nice, though one mishap occurred when we were billed for something in the bar that we didn't order. The reception cleared it for us right away without the hassle we may of experienced at some other hotel. We didn't receive the 5th Ave view we were hoping for, but that's only fair when using points. Would definitely stay again.Dear Rose2li, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"

We're happy to hear you had a great stay!"
"582",5,"This is a small motel off the beaten path in East Springfield the next town over if you are visiting Cooperstown - it was INCREDIBLY CLEAN and the customer service was outstanding. Family kind of place, they had a better breakfast than any of the many high priced hotels I have stayed at and it was very affordable! I highly... More"
"583",5,"front desk was awesome, housekeeping was awesome, the only thing was the last night of our stay, the security guard asked to check our room out for absolutely no reason we were about to go to bed and were being quiet...we had the same 3 people we had had the whole time and he said interesting and walked out, nothing else happened and we went to bed....VERY strange...other than that I loved this hotel and we will be retuning!!!"

"585",4,"We had a corner suite on the 8th floor this past weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the room and bathroom. Upon check-in, we were told that the pool and roof bar were on the 9th floor. We had concerns about possible noise only being one floor down, but our stay was very quiet throughout the weekend. Pluses:The room was very clean and nicely furnished. Customer service was excellent. We called the front desk to request a fridge for medication and it was delivered within 5 minutes. We also saw a couple gift items in the gift store early on Sunday morning before our flight out but the shop had not opened yet. The manager was kind enough to open the store for us an hour beforehand so that we could make our purchases. The hotel is only a short 5-10 mins walk from the French Quarter. High quality, soft toilet paper and high quality toiletries and linens provided. Nice brushed nickel finishes in the bathroom. Complimentary water in the room.Minor Issues:King-sized bed was a bit lumpy and sagged except for the middle. We would have preferred a smoother, firmer mattress. The power buttons and volume buttons on both remote controls for the TVs did not function. The next day, we finally found the joystick button on the bottom middle frame of each TV to control the volume and power. We did not use the pool, but it is very small.We are delighted you enjoyed your time at NOPSI. Let us know when you are travelling back to NOLA and we will ensure your stay is most memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"586",4,"The hotel was nice but the staff in the bar were lazy and rude."
"587",4,"We stayed one night after a full day of touring and driving. The staff were friendly and the room was clean - though a bit dated and in need of some service (a lamp was burned out). The breakfast was very tasty and the fella who was stocking was very attentive and helpful. Overall, a good stay."
"588",3,"Bad: Room was a lot smaller than I expected, and seemed a bit rundown. Not to mention we were supposed to be on a floor that was nonsmoking. The floor smelled of a smoking lounge. Good: Location and staff were awesome. Had a great view of Freemont street from our room."

"593",4,"The Breakfast staff were beyond wonderful. The Front Desk staff were always helpful and friendly. However, I did have an issue with closing charges that were applied to the card I used as a GTD only, resulting in a credit that seems to be taking forever. The hotel overall was always clean and well maintained. Elevators could have been built a little bigger!"
"594",4,"This hotel is in a beautiful location. Staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Eli at the front desk. Rooms were spacious qns clean with balcony looking over beach and ocean. Will definitely be booking there on my next trip to virginia beach."

"596",4,"We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a road trip! The reception staff were lovely and polite on check in! The rooms were comfortable, clean and very funky! The bathroom was amazing! However the toiletries were not replaced when the room was serviced daily. The walls were quite thin and we could hear the guy in the room next door! It wasnt horrendous and it didnt disturb us. It seemed to be very stylish but some of the finer points were missed. The upstairs bar was recommended to us on check in so we tried it out. We were really disappointed with the bar, it was a Monday night, and it was not busy. The staff seemed uninterested in us, we sat down and my dad went to the bar to ask a couple of questions, he was stood there for nearly 10 minutes, we decided to leave when eventually a member of staff spoke with him so we decided to stay. The first drink I wanted was a southern comfort, but they had none. Next I wanted a Gin and tonic but they had no tonic. In the end I had a cider which wasnt very nice. The bar staff continued to seem disinterested in us and we felt like a burden to them. It was nice sitting on the roof top and having a drink but that was the only bit of the experience we enjoyed. We did not use their car park because it was expensive, but it was in a good location for other car parks. We did not want to be in the middle of the French quarter and found that we enjoyed the 20 minute walk to get there from the hotel! It is in a good location for lots of breakfast stops as well. Hello Leah,Thank you for your stay with us. We are pleased to hear that your check in experience went well but we are sorry to hear there were some issues with housekeeping and the service you received at our roof top bar. These issues have been addressed with the team so that we may improve on this. We hope you will give us a chance to win you back as a guest."
"597",5,"stayed for a birthday party on the 26th DEC. SAL at the front desk was amazing!!!!! he is so sweet and his service was completely very welcoming. Anything we needed or had questions about SAL was the guy to go to. he knew all the area asked what we liked and made sure our car was there without waiting. All others at the front desk were not as professional and were not courteous. there was a big difference in service. SAL made it feel like we were in Vegas very professional. I will be coming back again ONLY if SAL is there. ME and my Husband luv the place. Thank you SAL!!!!"

"601",5,"The hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The location is great and you can easily walk to all the main attractions. It is right by the river which is a nice view. The room was really modern and clean. There was a coffee machine in the room and the hotel provided complementary fruits and soda and water. The staff were really friendly and helpful. I would defiantly go back there and highly recommend it.Thank you, Alex F, for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to post a review.

Cartoon characters, men in thongs and even one in an adult diaper! It's Hollywood Blvd on steroids! Thanks for the memories, Downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street Experience is one I do not wish to repeat!. Good: The hotel was very nice, much nicer than The Plaza next door."

She was able to answer every question and didn't seem to mind that we asked the same ones several times. Second, breakfast was wonderful. Finally, location was perfect for the conference we needed to attend the following day. The only reason I rated surrounding neighborhood so low is that the hotel is surrounded by highways, but that adds to its convenience."

"641",1,"I have been coming to the DC area on business for the past 6 months and will continue to do so for another 6 months. I usually stay at the Homewood Suites in Springfield, however, they were completely booked for this last stay. This is the first ... and last ... time I will stay at Extended Stay America in Springfield. The hotel literally STINKS!! The lobby, the elevator and our room had various smells of smoke, body odor, curry and feet!! Daily housekeeping service is only available if you stay for a week ... unless you want to pay 15/day for it. The towels are hard, scratchy and very thin ... and the toilet paper is the same. In our full kitchen, we had 1 fork and 3 spoons. The coffee maker was on it's last leg ... and we only had 1 packet of coffee with ancient creamer whose powder was so hard it didn't even melt in the coffee. The continental breakfast was 3 thermos of coffee, a basket of apples, and stale muffins and is located on a table right next to the front door, which caused a traffic jam with people trying to get in/out of the hotel in the morning. On a positive note, the hotel staff was pleasant, the bed was nice and the location is good. Otherwise, this hotel is definitely not worth the money!!"
"642",5,"The Saint Hotel is a top notch hotel located only half a block from the action of Duval St. From the check-in experience, to the amazing upgraded room overlooking the beautiful infinite pool and the convenience of the prime location in Key West this place was awesome. Upon check-in I was helped to my room by the amazingly helpful and friendly staff and I was directed to some places I should check out for the nightlife all within walking distance. The next 2 days, I started my mornings with the complimentary continental breakfast followed by exploring the island of Key West on 1 of the complimentary hotel bikes. I was able to end my afternoons with some relaxation in the amazing pool area. The entire staff was extremely helpful and professional throughout my stay. It was great to see the manager Abraham was very active with the everyday workings of the hotel staff and guests to ensure everyone has a great, unforgettable experience at the Saint. I would without a doubt stay at The Saint on my next trip to Key West!!Miss Elissa, Very Nice, you told me you were going to write a review, but I didn't expect all this, your writing has definitely spread smiles throughout the employees. Thank You, the whole staff thanks you. We are delighted you chose The Saint Hotel during your stay in Key West, you were a fun guest, easy to talk to and a delightful ray of sunshine around the property. Should your future travels bring you back to Key West, we hope The Saint Hotel will be your preference out of the many hotels to choose. Once again Thank You for the wonderful review."
"643",4,"This hotel is a great stay if you're looking to go into DC. Me and my friend went down at the end of Aug 2010. Although we had to change rooms two times, overall, the experience was good. The first room had the smell of urine so we asked to change. The second room had a roach in it so again we asked to change. We weren't taking any chances because if there is one roach there may be more. Finally, the third room was great. The hotel was conveniently located near the train station, mall, and diner. The hotel shuttle was great also. There were many options during breakfast. We received small gifts from the hotel during our stay such as goody bags and treats. It was really nice to come back after being away from the hotel and find something special left in the room. That was nice. The outside of the hotel was really beautiful. I really enjoyed my experience and think that I would stay there again."

"646",4,"After doing research for hotels in D.C areas, I found this hotel very attractive in term of price and easy access to metro to D.C. They provide shuttle to the closest metro station, and the metro go directly to D.C downtown which is very helpful for us. However, I recommend to use their shuttle not during the peak hours, especially from 5 to 7pm, otherwise you end up joining a bunch of people waiting for shuttle. The breakfast is surprisingly very good, especially the waffle which is one of the best. My kids and I love it, and I recommend this hotel for family trip."
"647",1,"The walls had unpainted spackle. There was a loose bulb hanging from bare wires in the bathroom. I told the front desk the bulb was a safety hazard and should be replaced but they didn't bother to fix it. I got the impression that they don't care about the condition of their own hotel."
"648",5,"We stayed overnight to prepare for my daughter's bridal shower. Having a full size refrig was great for storing all the cold food needed for brunch. The room was clean, quiet and smelled great. Easy check in. Would definitely stay here again."

The biggest surprise was the breakfast caf where made to order omelets were available along with all the other breakfast items you would expect. A very pleasant stay."

"656",2,"I booked this hotel through a major web site. I was told I would get a king size bed, smoking room with refrig, microwave coffee maker. When I got there the man at the desk said I get a smoking room with 2 double beds, He said thats what the web site sent to them. I dont believe that, he wouldnt show me. So I had to take it. The elevator sounded like it was on its last leg. The carpets were filthy, no coffee maker, the mattresses and boxed springs must of been 10 yrs old very uncomfortable, even holes in the sides, pillows felt like shredded foam and to make matters worse, there were cob webs all up the walls and corners by the sink. The television was old in a huge coffin like tv stand, no channel guide, no dresser and no comfortable chairs. For a few dollars more I will go across the street next time."

"663",5,"The Suncoast Hotel and Casino has become our home away from home. We are treated like family on our return visits. It's nice to see familiar faces the casino staff and restaurant staff. We especially enjoy the Oyster Bar Restaurant. The hotel rooms are beautiful, comfortable, clean, and roomy. The golf course and mountain views are beautiful while having breakfast. We always rent a car to visit some of our favorite places. Enterprise rent a car is right up the road they pick you up at the hotel and drop you off when you are done with the car. The distance between the strip and downtown is REALLY not a problem. The location and atmosphere is laid back away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and there is a Cheesecake Factory across the street where we always visit at least once while we are there. All in all, if you visit Las Vegas to relax and do some casual gambling, this is a gem of a place to stay. We would highly recommend the Suncoast, but rent a car if you want to check out the rest of the city......Aloha!"
"664",2,"The experience here was less than satisfactory for many reasons. Firstly when we arrived with our rental car at about 4pm tired after a 15 hour flight and the need to fill in the day till check in time at 3pm, we were astounded to find the hotel completely roped off with no way in. Seems the carpark which... More"

Went to the service desk the next morning but our request for help wasn't recorded and we had to submit another request. Maintenance worker came up and fixed the clog but before anyone fixed it my family had to go to the restroom near the lobby. On another note, Breakfast was great and kitchen staff was welcoming."
"666",5,"This was our second time staying at the Maple Leaf Motel. Cindy, the owner / manager takes great pride in the cleanliness of the rooms. And she loves her flowers! It is a gem right on the main road into Charlevoix. Prices are reasonable. This is definitely our go-to place to stay in that area of the State."

So, we checked in late after a very long day of travel. Because we were checking in that late, I actually called to make sure they... More"
"668",4,"Bad: The neighbourhood is a little seedy, but understand that is part of the city's charm!. Good: Enjoyed our stay at Zetta."
"669",5,"I just needed to crash before an early morning flight. The airport shuttle service was fast and courteous, the hotel bar was relaxing for a nightcap, and the room had everything I needed, including a quiet night."
"670",5,"I never write these kind of things but this time I thought it was warranted. My family and I just finished a stay at the Springhill Suites by Marriott on Pensacola Beach and it was great. Honestly one of the reasons it was so great was because of one of the bartenders named Crystal. She was so wonderful. Very friendly... More"
"671",5,"Hotel was very clean and staff was very friendly. The location was close to the mall and the airport. Indoor pool, updated rooms Enjoyed my stay and will use again and recommend as a great choice of property."
"672",4,"Bad: Internet connection not great from my room. Good: Quiet and great bed... But room a bit dark and no view. Super service and boutique feeling to everything."
"673",5,"Get away to enjoy family yet relax with the sights and sound of surf."
"674",5,"This hotel is very nice. Comfortable bed, lots of room, great Breakfast. The only cheesy thing was their evening snack at happy hour. It was potato chips and cheese with a variety of dry snacks. They may as well have put out pretzels and nuts and called it a day. I expected more."
"675",4,"Our first room had a problem with the shower pressure and hot water so the staff was very helpful and understanding and gave us the room right next door (this was very gracious as we checked in late at night and it wasn't a hassle to move our stuff to another room). The service was helpful and very friendly. The... More"
"676",4,"We were In Dallas for a wedding and the hotel was clean, comfortable and conveniently located. Located near shopping and readily accessible off the tollroad, we were able to decompress for the weekend and enjoy the festivities."
"677",4,"We were a group of three couples in our fifties who were on a 10 day wine trip in Northern California. We spent three nights at the Best Western Inn at the Vines. It was clean, breakfast was convenient and the location was fine.The best part of the stay was the help we received from the front desk by Bridget. She was more than willing to answer questions, make suggestions for things to do, places to visit, and she offered restaurants choices."
"678",4,"I was staying for a conference that was hosted at the hotel."
"679",5,"First time here and it will definitely not be my last. This hotel is beautiful. Had the 2 bedroom suite and it was awesome. Love Everything about it. You cannot go wrong with this hotel."
"680",4,"We came to Maui to get married and were recommended this place by a colleague at my work. We rented a one bedroom condo and I have to say it is beautiful Very happy with our condo. I read some reviews by others about the lack of cleaning service, but we have not had that experience during our stay here.... More"
"681",5,"Nice affordable close to campus. Big rooms. Clean. Great breakfast. Great value"
"682",4,"Bad: TV CABLE didn't work, kids bored. Good: Location"
"683",4,"the room/bath was clean and airy, price OK (late March) and free breakfast fine. we had some room mechanical problems (door lock, heater cover) but they were fixed. We toured Butte homse and mining and needed a quiet place to collapse at night - this place fit the need."
"684",5,"Very nice well maintained suites. Great breakfast. Nice amenities. Highly recommend for those going to The Ark and Creation Museum. Close to all kinds of shopping and good restaurants. Quiet location, no freeway noise."
"685",3,"Our experience was ok. The room felt crammed with only 2 people. I didn't like the sink being outside of the bathroom. On the first day after checking in the TV would not turn on. Problem with the remote control. Once it came on some local channels were grainy. Not very clear. On the 3rd day housekeeping didn't take out trash, clean, or make the beds. I had to take out the trash myself. They only took towels out. I went and spoke to the front desk and a few hours later someone came and cleaned and replaced the towels. The breakfast area was small for the amount of people they have staying there."
"686",4,"Went down to San Antonio for a weekend trip and I must say that I was quit impressed with the hotel and staff. Excellent on my end!"
"687",5,"Bad: Did not like the breakfast."
"688",2,"Was not impressed! We only stayed here because it was close to Disneyland on our last night staying in California. We got in close to midnight. I had called to confirm earlier that evening letting them know that we were going to check in late-that was not a problem. Everyone was tired and just wanted to sleep. The A/C was always on. It did not turn off and we tried everything. Beds were uncomfortable-Difficult to sleep. Woke up to make coffee in our room. Coffee maker did not work."
"689",4,"My first impression was that the lobby was full of pimps and hookers! The hotel was very nice, very clean but the guys standing by the door asking if they could bum a cigarette as I checked in with my 3 small sons skeeved me out a little bit. The room was clean, beds comfortable, towels fluffy, we checked in at 11.30pm and were out by 9am so it was a place to sleep and nothing else."
"690",3,"All was good except the breakfast. No options at all. Left and went to Ihop!!!"
"691",2,"I must not have read any of these negative reviews when I booked this room over a month ago. None of them are exaggerating. We drove out here 4 days before checking in to check it out. I asked to see a room but the desk person said no. I specifically requested a room that allowed us to at least... More"
"692",5,"Stayed here for 4 nights. Price was on the lower end of choices on Key West so we were prepared for some short comings. We were very surprised at the cleanliness of the grounds and size if the room given the price bracket. We had room 146, which put us on the inside, bottom floor. Very comfy king size bed, small fridge, dresser, and desk didn't come close to filling up the room. I paced it off to about 20x16! The bathroom was also spacious. No tub but a glass enclosed shower the size of a tub with plenty of pressure and hot water. The included breakfast was what I'd call a Continental Plus, as it also had scrambled eggs, sausages, and DIY fresh made waffles. Heated pool and pool bar too! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommended! Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed our spacious clean rooms. Thank you for staying with us and recommending us to all of your friends."
"693",4,"Bad: The breakfast is nothing special. Parking is 30 per each 24Hrs."
"694",5,"The two bedroom suites worked out very well for kids. Staff of hotel were very helpful. Close to Disney and other attractions. Reasonably priced."
"695",5,"Newly remodeled so rooms were fresh and clean although the pillows were too bulky for our taste. Nice that we could open the window. Large pool and hot tub. Good breakfast selections, we liked that they had mini-waffles and mini-muffins so you could try several options without wasting food or for smaller appetites. Denny's restaurant on the property so we... More"
"696",4,"This would have been a five star review except they really need to update the place. It doesn't cost much toast least get some new towels and bedspreads. Other than that, it was just great! We were traveling with our too large dogs and they were able to hang outside on the deck with us and hike in the forest... More"
"697",5,"Everyone there is very friendly, accommodating and helpful. Hidden behind Holiday Inn, it's very much worth the stay. This is the 3rd or 4th time we have used this hotel and will continue to. Never had a problem here and continental breakfast offers a huge variety."
"698",5,"Bad: The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub. Though it didn't bother us personally. Good: I loved how central the location was. The hotel is in the theatre district. We walked to the harbour as well as Shopping and all the parks around us. After a long day of walking around we enjoyed A massage at the Bliss spa. We also enjoyed having a drink at the lounge before going to bed. It was a great experience for us. It might be too noisy for people who want peace and quite. I also had the best sleep in those beds. I would recommend staying at the W Boston."
"699",4,"The HI Express is located right in the middle of southern Appalachia, minutes from Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, and seconds off Interstate 40 at exit 435 (easy on and off). We were headed to Asheville, NC on vacation. Toyed with driving all the way to Asheville (75 minute further SE), but the hotels their were at least 60-100/night more expensive.... More"
"700",4,"My daughter and I have stayed for 5 nights here during our visit to New Orleans. Very cute hotel, modern design, good vibe, friendly staff! We've got a nice corner room at 14th floor, beds were so comfortable and everything is new and clean! Walking distance from French quarter, Bourbon street, Lafayette square, we didn't even use any transportation beside the street car to get to the City Park. Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. Our guest comments are very important to us, they allow us an opportunity to celebrate our successes while also finding ways we may improve. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to New Orleans.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager"
"701",4,"I booked at this hotel because on the NIH Clinical Center website, it was one of the hotels listed as convenient to the NIH. However, that is false! You can take the metro red line to the NIH, but it will take you a long time, as it is several stops away. One morning, it took me 2 hours from leaving the hotel to arriving at the NIH because there was track maintenance! If you are in town to visit the NIH, I don't recommend staying here. Otherwise, the hotel is fine, the room was a little small, but clean. Also, the elevator interiors could use some upgrading. The carpet was dirty and ragged."
"702",5,"This is a great place to stay, particularly for the value. It would be nice if they offered a breakfast bar."
"703",1,"I hate it very disappointed. It is a dump I wouldn't suggest this place to my worst enemy!!"
"704",5,"We stay at this hotel when ever we get a chance to go to Jupiter. There are a lot of fancier hotels in Jupiter that cost a lot more money but I would still prefer to stay at this hotel. It is always clean and the staff is always friendly. They are in a fantastic location that is convenient to... More"
"705",5,"Good: Staff was friendly, rooms were clean! Everything was great"
"706",1,"Took a shower had to clean the drain my self as there was so much hair in it I would of thought I was getting the tub ready for a bath bedding had a lot of cigarette burns in it as well"
"707",4,"Short but good!"
"708",4,"The hotel staff makes you feel welcome. The rooms were clean and fresh. This is a great place/location to stay, the hotel was in an area where I felt safe and local area clean. there was several resturants and stores in walking distance.Thank you taking the time to complete the survey.We look forward to your future visits with us. Vina GM."
"709",5,"Beds not very comfortable, and the price was quite steep (even realizing it was Labor Day weekend and many Inns raise their rates) otherwise: very clean, well-appointed, convenient to many dining places and lake activities."
"710",5,"Bad: Wish there was ironing and ironing board in room. As well as microwave. They did provide iron and ironing board that I shared with my girlfriend 2 doors down and they let me use their microwave by the bar. So worked out. Good: Loved Javier and rest of the staff. Anything I needed they accommodated."
"711",5,"They should change a carpet in the room plus painting"
"712",5,"This stay was one of the BEST stays i have ever had at a hotel. The scenery was very beautiful and sitting on the balcony was very relaxing and enjoyable. My daughter loved swimming in the pool, however i feel the hot tub could have been a little bit cleaner."
"713",4,"Shower wall had old scum on it. So I took a bath, but not tub plug to stop up the water. Help them room 122."
"714",4,"Well, the grounds are well kept. pool was clean, and this was our third stay. Beds are ok, and the rooms served their purpose. Large tiled floors with some recycled furnishings from a popular strip hotel. It really wasnt a bad room. cheaper here for a week than 1 night on the strip. Bonus.. 8 feet to your room.. vs 1/2 mile on the strip!!! Not bad att all for a refirbished 1950's hotel, not too bad at all. Save your self the resort fees, stay here and eat you way around Vegas!!"
"715",1,"room not clean at all. I was not happy here, i checked out a day early. bathroom toilet seat had urine on it. trash in the bathroom when i checked in. room not vacuumed. window lock is a screw. I will never stay here again."
"716",4,"We enjoyed meeting classmates of the early fifties. We have been meeting here at the Colorado Belle for the past five years. We plan on seeing each other next October if God willing. The Loading Dock is where we eat most of the time."
"717",5,"Love this place! Great service, rooms and amenities. Can't beat the price and all the free food you get! I highly recommend to anyone. Free hot breakfast Buffett, free kick back dinner, and free popcorn/pop till 10:00pm. Very nice indoor/outdoor pool. The staff checks on all the guest in the dinning area to see if you need anything. Need I... More"
"718",2,"We had stayed at the Culver Cove years ago and were hoping things hadn't changed. We were disappointed to find the look of the inn has deteriorated. The condo we stayed in was dirty. We had to ask housekeeping to come and clean as soon as we checked into the room. Our TV was a delux 13, the stove and... More"
"719",4,"The hotel was clean and quiet. It is close to BWI has a restaurant/bar and I would stay there again."
"720",5,"Great location. Front desk staff very accommodating. Will go back."
"721",5,"The best!! Everything about our trip was excellent! We liked the place so much we added a few extra days!! The breakfast was so good and different each day. The rooms were beautifully decorated and clean and comfortable. Slept like a baby!"
"722",5,"I enjoyed it"
"723",4,"I have stayed at this location many times, never have I been disappointed. I plan to stay again in September for Center homecoming activities. I would recommend this location to anyone staying in Center for business or pleasure."
"724",2,"I didn't mind the small room, but I didn't like that it was old and dirty. ICK. I honestly couldn't wait to check out in the morning. The hallways had a heavy smoke smell, and then my room had a heavy perfume smell. What were they trying to cover up To top it off, the walls are paper thin. Not... More"
"725",2,"For the price and name, I expected better. The mattress was old and hard, as were the towels. The water pressure fluctuated and was poor. Extra coffee was brought upon request but without cream and sugar. It was overpriced for what you got. However, the staff was good and kind."
"726",2,"We had difficulty finding this motel. It is closer to Knott's Berry Farm over Disneyland. The check in lobby smelled of urine. The hotel does not have a lift of any sort for the second floor, therefore consider this if climbing stairs is an issue....More"
"727",5,"Comfortable room in a great town. Nothing fancy, just right for a stop on a road trip. Rob gave us great desk service and local advice. Rooms face the sunrise with was lovely. Guide books in the room were a nice touch and we found some great slot canyons from these. Made our trip even better."
"728",4,"Stay was good but the hotel adds expenses such as amenities fee of 25/day and parking fee of 35/day which they don't mention. So I paid 120 over the hotels.com rate."
"729",4,"Breakfast staff is second to none, finally someone who is pleasant and truly helpful and a pleasure to be around. He was one of the few I have ever seen that didn't have a grumpy attitude and felt like every thing you did he watched and made you feel bad if you made a mess. superstar!!!"
"730",5,"Loved it. Had a wonderful stay."
"731",5,"A huge thank you to Raul for such a wonderful experience by the bar and patio area yesterday! You were so attentive to us, and made the absolute BEST fruity drink for me. Your friendly smile and warm demeanor are so appreciated! Can't wait to go back and try another one of your fruity concoctions! :)"
"732",1,"We stayed here for 2 nights, and we chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on hotels.com. Unfortunately, the hotel was not what I expected. It was not clean, and was very run-down and dated. The front desk staff members were not pleasant, and one of them was downright rude. Their free breakfast was definitely a disappointment, as it was lacking in quality. I suppose since it was free, there's not much that I can complain about. The food was tasteless, there wasn't enough on hand for all of the guests (except for the cereal) and the breakfast area was very dirty. I would not stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else."
"733",4,"This Comfort Inn is in the process of a face lift. The rooms have been totally renovated and an elevator was to be installed within the week. Our room was very comfortable with a king bed, fridge, microwave, desk and lounge chair. It was nicely done with new linens and pillows as well. Staff was very friendly. It is located... More"
"734",5,"Aria is excelent on al counts for a Las Vegas stay. It has excellent facilities and service is great in all areas of the hotel. Considering its size, it does provide high quality in all respects. I have had excellent experiences at this hotel and our last stay was no exception."
"735",3,"Great location on the beach, but rooms are really tiny, especially the bathroom. The free wireless internet is useless, as in our three day stay, the signal was too week to access, not even once - despite our room's nearness to the management office. No excuse for that."
"736",3,"I had asked for a handicap room but did not get one. I guess I would rate the hotel as a 3. The road leading to the hotel was very rough....out of control of the hotel. The hotel offered a very small breakfast area....enough for maybe 6 people. Not what was pictured. Limited parking due to the bar and many Christmas parties."
"737",5,"My housekeeper Tonya Johnson cleaned my room very well and was also very friendly and made sure i had everything i need for my stay. in would suggest this Best Western to anyone that wants a nice room at a good rate with great staff"
"738",4,"Room was clean and spacious, when u walk in the lobby has a funny smell, but overall the hotel is great."
"739",5,"The breakfast each morning was really quite good. A lot of food and a lot of choices - not just carbs. Also, the shuttle that takes your from the hotel to anywhere within 3 miles was extremely valuable. We got to see DC and paid much less than average per night because the shuttle allowed us to go to the Metro every day, We also used the shuttle to go to restaurants for dinner, pick up a rental car for one day, and even church on Sunday"
"740",5,"I was very pleased with my stay. My only compliant was that the waffle batter was extremely watery. Other then that, breakfast was really good. I also loved how this hotel offered so many amenities. Even though, I did not get a chance to use the fitness room, the business center, pool and spa were all very nice. I loved... More"

More"
"742",5,"Really good hotel in the city and I have stayed in a few now. I would recommend to anyone looking for a modern good hotel with the all the right facilities."
"743",3,"This was just an OK place to spend a night since it was close to our destination and was fairly inexpensive. You can tell it was an older hotel that has been renovated. Room was cleaned, but smelled of air freshener, probably to hide a smoke smell. Just didn't have that usual new Best Western feeling."
"744",1,"Frightening. The only good thing about the hotel was the free parking and convenience to the French Quarter. High price for what they provided. Below par for even a budget hotel."
"745",3,"This is an older property with very limited parking. Since the town of Solvang is easily accessible by walking, most lodging is convenient. The rooms were clean and decor is basic. The refrigerator didn't keep things cold (even at max), but there is an ice machine. The air conditioner was an older model and very loud, but did cool the... More"
"746",4,"Spacious and clean room. Very comfortable and firm bed with down pillows and comforter. We had no problem connecting to the free WiFi. Little luxuries in the room included a Keurig machine, k-cups and a mini fridge. We arrived after 1:00 AM and someone was still at the front desk to greet us. There is a nice little area next to the front desk where they sell snacks, drinks (including beer) and basic toiletry items. The indoor pool is open 6:00am - 11:00pm - didn't get to experience it but it looked very nice - there is also a hot tub. Made reservation for a smoking room however, the entire building is smoke free FYI. There is breakfast served next to the lobby area in the morning - there is a continental breakfast (6.95) or a breakfast buffet (9.95). We had the buffet and it was very good - you can order custom omelets and they had biscuits, sausage gravy, bacon, sausage, grits and eggs all hot and ready. There is also milk, juice, and soda available. We also liked the late check-out time (12 noon) since we got in so late. We would definitely stay here again - overall, very happy we picked this hotel!"
"747",5,"This hotel is great! The amenities are really nice. The bathrooms are nice, and have the best showers of any hotel I have ever stayed at. I'll certainly stay here again. All the staff is fantastic. Teri and Charlie during Kickback are especially fantastic and help to make your stay fun."
"748",5,"Loved it did not expect to be that great the owners are just wunderful loved it and enjoyed give them ***** stars anytime thank u guys so much can't wait to go back . Best family vacation ever thanks to the owners."
"749",5,"Nice place to stay. Very quiet. Even with outside temps around 40's the pool area was in the 70's and water was relaxing. and of course those late evening cookies are a nice touch as well. Breakfast was always ready at 6:00 and also has those Breakfasts To-Go-Bags if youre in a hurry."
"750",5,"The rooms were brand new with huge balconies. A glass wall opened to the balcony so that the room was fully open to the outside. The staff was extremely friendly and courteous and the hotel was in a great location. Each unit had a full kitchen and the pool area was what you expect from a much more expensive resort.... More"
"751",3,"When you read the information about Lenore, believe it. She is the bright and shining asset to this hotel. The staff are very personable and helpful. The rooms definitely need some upgrading. The location however is wonderful."
"752",3,"Checked in at 3am had an early flight, the hotel employee that checked me in was rude and very unpleasant! He lied to me about a hold on my account, before he made me go to my bank and transfor money becusee my card wouldn't work then when I came back he told me that they would place a 200 hold when he prev told me that there would be no hold!! Just rude his whole attitude! Asked for a manager but was told no one is on duty."
"753",4,"Nice hotel with very friendly staff. The hotel has recently remodeled their rooms, they are clean and comfortable. Great location for restaurants exploring old town Portland. This is not a high end property, but very nice for the price convenience."

"755",5,"Great Stay! Staff was very helpful!"
"756",4,"I've stayed at this hotel twice both times in November. Perhaps it's just because it's a slow season in that area, both times I got a GREAT sleep. Peace and quiet and a clean room is all I ask. The hotel strikes me as a property that was redone (or built) in the 2000s. The linen and furnishing, wall coverings,... More"

"760",4,"We had a very good stay at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. I had been worried about the breakfast because I had seen some reviews that hated the warm up eggs and breakfast sandwiches but I thought they were just fine and there were a few other good options. The only thing that sucks about the warm up sandwiches is the waste it makes. Itd be nice if the wrappings were recyclable.The only negative thing I would say is that the rooms are showing a need for a deep clean. There is dirt accumulating in the corners and soap scum on the shower shelves. The room in general was clean but definitely showed signs of cleanliness neglect if that makes sense. Location is excellent for two reasons. 1) central to all of the attractions which makes everything super walkable and 2) right across the street from Reading Terminal which was awesome!"

"762",1,"don't do it. it may save you money, but you will regret it. you get what you pay for, and in the case of this hotel, you don't get what you don't pay for."
"763",5,"Good: The staff were professional, friendly and eager to please. It was our anniversary and a lovely bottle of wine was waiting for us on arrival which was a really lovely touch. The Cavalier bar/restaurant is super and make sure you have Liam mix up one of his fabulous cocktails! Very central location but nice and quite hotel."
"764",5,"We loved everything about this hotel. It's updated and has a fresh 2016 look with brightly colored decor. It was clean and the staff was VERY friendly! The pool was outdoors! The fitness room had everything we needed for some good workouts!"
"765",1,"When we arrived in our room around 10:30 pm we noticed a very strong odor. We tried waiting it out for about an hour, but it never subsided. We think the smell was marijuana. At about midnight, we had to pack up all our stuff with a 3 and 5 year old and swap rooms. Hotel offered no type of reimbursement or anything."
"766",3,"I didn't realize until after a Week later after my stay that I left over 100 worth of medical back therapy equipment. I didn't think to call but I have to admit I am disappointed that no one from the hotel bothered to contact me with these items that were accidentally left"

"768",4,"This hotel was easy to get to and only 8 miles from Lake Geneva, WI. The hotel was clean and the service was excellent. It was in a nice area of town with local business stores within a block of the hotel. The only drawback was no fridge in room."

"773",4,"I went with my family. The hotel is very new and service is good. On the downside it's far from Napa downtown and farther from the wine yards. Breakfast can get very crowded. There is a cinema and some restaurant at walking distance if you don't want to drive. Good place if you don't want to drive further to get to the attractions. Dear Alejandro M,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We thank you for your feedback and comments. We are located near several restaurants and the Cinema which is very convenient for travelers to the area. There are over 500 wineries in Napa and depending on which wineries you are looking to travel to our hotel does have easy access to the local highway to get you to your winery destination. We thank you again for your valuable feedback and hope to serve you on your next trip to Napa, Serina Najar."
"774",5,"Bad: Bed was a bit hard. Breakfast was all carbs, but was better than nothing. Good: Great location, right near two T stops and directly across from the Boston Public Library. Super nice staff. Great bar downstairs. Great price. We loved having music speakers overhead in main room and bathroom. Roomy, hot shower with great water pressure. Free continental breakfast with good coffee."
"775",4,"I was very satisfied with this hotel for the price. It offers a breakfast, free internet and an exercise room all included with a decent room that has all of the things to make your stay easier. The exercise room is small and the breakfast has limited options, but for the price is better than several more expensive places that offer neither."
"776",5,"The hotel made a mistake when I called for a handicap room. The room we had to settle for had one king bed instead of two beds as requested as this was the only handicap room available. The manager arranged to have a cot brought in, which we agreed to. However, we decided not to stay the second night. I... More"
"777",2,"I was quite disappointed with this hotel. The front desk clerk was rude and put my family in a dirty room (beds were not made, one of the pictures was pulled off of the wall and food still in the room). I then had to switch rooms and clerk seemed annoyed that I was unhappy with the status of my room."
"778",5,"We stayed one night here in July with a 10 yr old. The hotel was very clean. Rooms were up to date and comfortable. I slept very well!! They had a nice area outside on a small lake where you could stroll or sit, very relaxing in the morning. Breakfast was impressive for being a continental breakfast. Hot sandwiches, pastries,...

"779",4,"We stayed at this location for one night. It's a nice hotel. The rooms are quite spacious. We were in what probably qualifies as a suite. The bedroom door closes and there is a smallish living room area with a pull out couch. The hotel common areas are very clean and they look very new. The room was the same... More"
"780",3,"The bed was very comfortable, however the iron did not work properly and water seeped out of the bottom of the iron. Water drained from the bottom of the shower and I had to put towels on the floor around the shower to prevent falling. The room was dusty, the colors in the room were not inviting or appealing. I think a complimentary brunch would have been nice. If you are going to put coffee makers in the rooms at least give the customer something to stir the hot coffee."
"781",5,"Rooms are small, but staff is very accommodating. A good jumping-off place for commuting into DC"

"785",5,"Bad: Rooms are a bit small and food is mediocre. Good: Atmosphere overall was chill. Great after busy workday."
"786",5,"My husband and I celebrated our 1st anniversary and stayed at The Inn at Europa. Up on a hill overlooking the vineyards took us to another place far away. It was beautiful.

"790",1,"This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The rooms where not clean. The showers did not work well( went from hot to cold, then hot then cold) I had to unplug the tv to plug in the microwave because they did not accommodate for both. Just an unpleasent experience. Certainly wasn't worth the price ."
"791",1,"Dirty, old soap on floor of shower, real thin 2 towels, only 1/2roll TP, bed real soft lumpy, no water glass, smelled moldy, the AC Was so noisy whenever it decided to cycle would wake up Rip VanWinkle. I looked for Cheep and I got it."

"793",5,"I travel a lot for business and picked this hotel to try out and the price was right.Had clean rooms ,most important was the high speed wifi and it worked great. The staff was friendly and helpful.Planning to come back for vacation with family.I highly recommend this place for your trip."
"794",5,"Bad: Some of the front desk staff came off a bit rude. This is a nicer hotel, and we just felt like since we don't always dress fancy - after all, we were on vacation and out and about all day, every day - that we were looked down upon. We aren't fancy people but wanted to spoil ourselves for our anniversary. Good: We loved the location and the style of the hotel and the rooms. Caesar at the door was extremely welcoming and helpful."
"795",4,"Bad: I booked a room with city view but they said the only view is of the wheel. Good: The staff were helpful, comfortable beds and location."
"796",4,"It was memorable stay in Aria Resort, very good valet service and friendly staff at the reception. Rooms are big size and all the controls are at our finger. Ample shopping area and great restaurants. This city center hotels and resort is very attractive structure and good value for money and much more."
"797",2,"Pleasant check in, room.smelled.like stale smoke, a few dead bugs on the Floor and had to go through a swarm.to enter the room. There were red stains on.the door that seemed odd..dead bugs Building is fairly.dated but room was updated except.for the bed condition. It was not comfortable at all. The shower was good, hot and strong. Breakfast was very nice and goes until 10am. they needed more seating though for guests. Not a bad hotel..would.probably choose a different one next time."
"798",3,"Upon arriving at the hotel, the check in process was really easy. We were given these memory card/stick things as keys. Opening the door was loud as when your key was accepted it beeped.

Be sure to check your confirmation when booking to ensure you've selected the correct room.

"806",5,"Great place to stay in the keys at an affordable price without sacrificing quality. Location: not on the beach but within driving/ biking distance to downtown and quiet. On site is a biking company to rent bikes or scooters from definitely recommend. Their kiosk is located next to the pool bar.Room: clean room, clean bedding/sheets, bed was medium comfort but we slept fine Pool: beautiful and big it wasn't crowded at all so you could enjoy it an any time. Lounge chairs were comfortable and cabanas were nice on a first come first serve basis. The pool bar was very nice with a variety of drinks. I wouldn't recommend the pool food with the exception of the wings and fries which were really good. Try some of the local beers on tap my favorite was the Crazy Lady very smooth. Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel.

"829",5,"My stay was surprisingly wonderful, except they didn't mention any charges at check in after the bill was paid for ahead of time. If they're going to charge customers after they've already paid ahead of time, then they should at least give the customer the common decency and respect to advise them of such action. People don't like surprise charges and no legit reasons."
"830",5,"It's a newer hotel. Not much to comment on. Staff was especially friendly from the front desk to the food servers. Room was nice. Quiet sleep and everything is pretty new of course. Would stay here again for sure. Right off i55 and easy access."
"831",5,"The room was clean. The staff was kind. There was a complimentary hot breakfast that included waffles and scrambled eggs, coffee and yogurt. The hotel is located next to a shopping mall and is not far from restaurants. My daughter enjoyed swimming in the pool. I would stay here again."

"837",3,"We stay at this property at least once a year when we head to Vegas to visit family. We like the location, off the strip in more of the residential area. The rooms have recently been renovated with an updated dcor. The rooms are very spacious and we have never had a problem with noise. The pool never seems crowded. The food is average. Sunrise breakfast for 3.99 in the caf, but you have to know about it as it is not on the menu. We are members of their BConnected players program and do receive the occasional perk, however be aware that anything you win ie. breakfast buffets, have to be used the following day. Other casinos vouchers are good for a longer period of time. Years ago I used to win money or break even, not so for the past few years. We had an issue with our bill at check-out, as we do every year. Someone had visited a bar and charged it to our room. The front desk gal said she'd look into it and within an hour was corrected. My only negative comment is how unwilling they are to satisfy a customer issue. Tried to use buffet coupons one day after expiration. We were told to go to the players club and see about getting comps...were told NO. We had a 15.00 food credit on the room which apparently was only good for that particular date (we used it the day before) and upon check-out was charged to the room. I explained that we were not told it could only be used for that particular date as our stay was for more that one day. NO credit. Very poor customer service considering the size of Boyd properties. Pretty sure 15.00 isn't going to break them and I don't like feeling cheated. This will definitely be a deciding factor for our next trip. Plenty of places to choose from when visiting Las Vegas. Suncoast isn't the only game in town!"
"838",4,"We enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and pleasant. The bed was comfortable. Although not a great deal of selection, the breakfast was good and sufficient. It was obvious that the owner wanted us to be comfortable and that resulted in us being comfortable. We appreciated it."
"839",4,"Entire Staff were excellent, with special mention for Taunya and Kayla at the front desk. They were always cheerful,smiling, and very helpful. Great breakfast, only issue is that space is limited so you may have to wait to sit if you want to eat there. Our room was worn and dated....Hotel needs updating but from the looks of it they may be in the process of doing. Large outdoor pool was clean and well kept. Kids loved it :-) Many restaurants and a very nice shopping mall minutes away. Overall.... great value for the price."
"840",5,"Every staff member very accommodating, welcoming and friendly!"

We only stayed one night here because our other hotel was booked for the rest of the trip but I will definitely be staying here the next time I come to Vegas for my entire trip. Great location"
"845",5,"Bad: 195 a night (including resort fee) is expensive but it is Miami and all hotels seem to be this much, I cant fault the hotel so its a case of pay up and smile!. Good: Excellent location at the quiet end of Ocean Drive but still within walking distance of bars and restaurants, beach, shops and local buses. Very comfy beds, beach towels and chairs available for use. Free glass of wine on an evening was a nice touch."
"846",4,"Located in good proximity to Metro station and lots of eateries. Hotel has seen some wear and tear, but was a good value for us. Heat in our room wasn't working and that was repaired right away. Sadly, we never did get a clock/alarm that worked."

Certainly a good bed, clean rooms, efficient elevators etc.,quiet, friendly staff"
"850",5,"Outstanding property, amenities and location. Very quiet and comfy rooms. The staff is 5 ***** Highly recommend! Easy access to down town dinning, theaters, Water sports or just a great place to vegetate!"

Good convenient Japanese restaurant in short walking distance provides a wonderful change from road food. All you need when passing through on a road trip."
"852",4,"I love that Denny's is right beside the hotel...that is one of the reasons why my family and I had came back to stay here again on our vacation. I did not like us getting non smoking rooms when I had reserved smoking in the first place. Unpacking in the wrong room then packing up again to move in the right room made me a little upset. Most nights that I had stayed there I couldnt sleep that well because of kids running up and down the hallways and knocking on our doors and running away. I believe the hotel staff should of been montioring the 3rd floors better than they had. The air conditioner did not work at all in room 343 and it got really hot in there.I believe the bathrooms could of been a little more cleaner than what they were. I had asked for a rollaway bed and didnt get one because they were all out. I asked for more pillows and blankets and all they gave me was two blankets. Yes it was pretty close to beach and zoo and all the must see sights. Next summer I plan on coming back to Virginia Beach but I will probably rent a beach house on Sandbridge for a week."

"855",4,"We had a wonderful trip at New Orleans as we are invited by Tulane University School of Medicine. Me and my spouse were extremely busy with academic commitments. The hotel is very good and near to Tulane School of Medicine. Breakfast is good and service is very high quality. The room is descent, medium size with all the amenities. Bathroom is simply superb. Room service is also praiseworthy. Only draw back is its House Keeping team. One should not keep any valuables or important materials outside as during house keeping things may be missing. One should lock all the valuables in his or her suitcase before leaving the room and kept for house keeping. This issue was serious by nature and we have reported several times on this issue. Otherwise it is a lovely hotel with very friendly front office staffers.Thank you for sharing the details of your stay. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the comments.

"863",5,"I was pleasantly surprised. I've stayed at many Hampton Inns and have always been pleased, but this one was a cut above! I like that it was tucked back off the main street and very conveniently located. The room was pristine, while still being inviting and comfortable. The staff was excellent. I will be back!"

"871",2,"Hotel was functional. Stayed for one night and glad it wasn't any longer. Check in was easy and efficient. Parking is directly behind the hotel. There is a tiny little alley that you wouldn't notice on the left side on the hotel, there are about 10 parking spaces and it's first come first serve. This is a very industrial neighborhood....

"872",2,"I travel to New Orleans for business about once a month and have the privilege of staying in quite a few hotels in NOLA, but Aloft was a standout, even though is it located very close to most attractions, the staff left us with a bad taste in our mouths. At check in, we were helped by Jermal and it was the worst check in experience I've ever had (even at Motel 6 they at least make eye contact with you and answer your questions). Very cold and not friendly staff with the exception of the valet guys. They were very nice and professional. Once we got to our room, it was clean and spacious. I did not find anything wrong with it except the infamous bad water pressure in the shower and the fact that we only had 2 big towels (All hotels I've stayed at have had 4 big towels) We signed up for the SPG Green Choice at check in so the extra towels would had been nice and we actually never received the 5 vouchers for making the green choice. Aloft has a lot of potential because of their location. I am giving them another chance in late May, hopefully this time they listen to our requests and are more customer oriented.Thank you for staying with us this past week.

"873",1,"Wedding party outside in pool area until 4:30 in morning. Very loud. Front desk was ignorant to whole event even tho you could see outside tables from lobby. Room was below average with door that seemed broken and toilet rocked on floor. Worst night at a hotel in 30 years. Unconcerned personnel with indifferent attitude was the worst. Never stay... More"
"874",5,"I am away from my home several months at a time. When I stay in St. Louis the Hampton is my home, the staff my family. I always get a friendly, happy, warm greeting from everyone on the Staff. Stay and you won't go away unhappy."
"875",5,"What a pleasant surprise. All rooms have a great view and are clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. This hotel is a real value."
"876",4,"Looks old from the outside but not bad on the inside. The breakfast and breakfast area was good. Baily's the restaurant was nice looking but understaffed at the time. The night shift lady messed up our room reservation but was quick to correct the mistake. The afternoon ladies were unpleasant and not quick to help. Not a bad stay if you don't need much help from the front desk."
"877",4,"My Dad and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Atlanta for the Chick Fil-A kickoff game between Louisville and Auburn. It was good value for money, with a spacious and comfortable room that was in great shape. The bathroom was spotless and seemed new. Even on the fifth floor, the noise from breakfast diners begins at 7:00 AM and is rather loud in rooms near the atrium, so if you want more quiet, request a room further away."
"878",4,"This hotel is a bit of a ride on the metro if you are going to DC but the facilities and staff are excellent. Great place for families with kids and an amazing breakfast. The shuttle to or from the metro is free and we only had to wait once for pick up - normally very prompt except for one 30 minute wait. Would highly recommend this hotel."
"879",3,"Clean, nothing fancy hotel. Only one bed in room. Right on busy highway, so some traffic noise. Great benefit of being across highway from shuttle bus to park. Good value for price compared to other hotels in area."
"880",4,"Bad: Waitress didn't come around a lot even with tipping. The hotel was older and had some cosmetic problems. Good: Lots to around the property and decent food prices. The buffet was really good."
"881",5,"Great place for an extended stay! Enjoy the atmosphere, the staff, and everything around the city there in Port Arthur. Enjoyed the fact that I could use the kitchenette with the room when not wanting to go out to eat all the time when I stayed for a few days. Will definitely stay again when traveling through the area."
"882",5,"One of the reasons we liked the Aqua Beach Inn because it was not one of those humongous hotels, but smaller and homier. It was also very inviting when you first walked in. Easy to unload you suitcases and get to your room which had everything you would need. Gorgeous view of the ocean from your balcony, and close to... More"
"883",5,"The overall ambience at this hotel was outstanding. The rooms were well supplied and the entire facility was clean and cheerful - but what made our stay at this facility so pleasant was the staff. From the housekeeping staff to the desk staff the smiles and friendliness were always obvious. Daniel, Nora, David, and Shalya at the desk were so... More"

"886",4,"The hotel is greatly unappreciated for the potential of the service and accomodations. The initial appearance is unfortunate because the facilities could be very nice if kept up. My room was very comfortable and was a bargain for the money."
"887",4,"Bad: There were a couple younger staff at the desk during mid day times that seemed bothered by questions. Good: Easy to park. The room was clean and cool. Valet staff was really nice. Steve the maintence man was amazing. I dropped my pearl earring down the bathroom sink. He took the time to take the loop of the drain and get my pearl earring back. I was grateful for his extra service and care."
"888",5,"My wife and I stayed with our dog at this Pet friendly hotel. We had an amazing experience. John Wehringer went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. The hotel was clean, staff was friendly and the price was very affordable. You cannot beat this pet friendly hotel anywhere in the valley. We will definitely be returning to stay.... More"
"889",5,"Good: breakfast in room!"
"890",5,"I have stayed at this particular location multiple times over the last several years and have always been happy with the courteous and professional staff. Breakfast is always fresh, tasty and a very good selection of items. The room, lobby, and breakfast areas have always been clean and presentable. Thanks to the staff for the hard work...very much appreciated!"
"891",5,"Great place to stay for reasonable price near Northpoint Mall. Very clean, moderate-sized, 6 foot something deep, indoor pool, and small hot tub. Staff VERY friendly and helpful! Good food at free Cont breakfast. Waffle House right across the parking lot if you are a late sleeper!"
"892",5,"This is an older property which reminded me of the ski lodges that you see in movies. The views were wonderful filled with fall leaves. The lobby had a fireplace and comfortable, cushy furniture. Wine and cheese was available in the lobby in the late afternoon. The rooms were spacious, and had all the amenities. Though not new, they were... More"
"893",5,"We stayed at The Westin Poinsett over the Christmas weekend. We usually stay at Starwood hotels whenever we travel so we are familiar with the service, which can be various at times. However, we were very pleased with the exceptional service from the staffs at this hotel. Every single staff was friendly, especially, Evelyn, from Spoon Bread restaurant. She made... More"
"894",3,"Bad: The breakfast was minimal. The rooms were tiny. There wasn't a workout room. Good: The room location was at the back of the hotel and quiet."
"895",2,"Room/hotel was not in great condition. Housekeeping left a note on first morning saying they had not cleaned the room because they were protecting our privacy - and we did not have a DND sign out, nor were we in our room late. Free WiFi was only free because it never worked. Breakfast food wasn't refilled - and there was still 30 min remaining."
"896",3,"The only good feature about the room was the price. Although clean for the most part it was listed as non-smoking but it was clear the room had been smoked in. Maintenance was very poor. The toilet tank cover was missing and the seat would not stay up. The coffee service in the room had not bee replaced in ages. There was a small balcony outside the room but there were holes in the ceiling covering it. Also, the building was not secured at night. Anyone could walk in. The building is old and really needs to be renovated."
"897",4,"Attentive and friendly staff. Quick and immediate response to requests and housekeeping needs. We stayed at the Star Inn , comfortable, clean and a convenient location."
"898",5,"My dad recently stayed at the Radisson Hotel in Freehold and was extremely pleased with the level of service. The front desk was extraordinarily helpful to him and the room was extremely clean and the bed was a Sleep Number bed - which he was raving about. He comes to Freehold to visit several times a year and will make... More"
"899",4,"I was traveling on business and stayed a couple days in June, 2015. A breakfast is included. The main street of Independence is within walking distance and there are several local eateries nearby, as well as a locally owned, fully stocked scrapbook store with Saturday hours and several antique shops. On Saturday morning I visited a farmers market about a... More"
"900",4,"great location right off of duval street. our room however was extremely small, smaller than a cruise ship, but very nice all the same. staff was friendly, breakfast was enough to get you going. pool area was beautiful. the only problem we had was that our room keys did not work properly. got one of them fixed which was good because after 11:00 at night no one is at the front desk to let you in lobby or hotel, a key is needed so double check you keys to outside entrances. would definitely return.As you found out, there is not a lot of space in Key West and yes some of the rooms are cozy. We appreciate the review and look forward to your return."
"901",3,"Traveling on business. Check in was horrible. Not very polite at all. Nor very friendly. I specifically asked for a non smoking room. The put me into a smoking room with a ash tray on the table in the room. There was burn holes, dog hairs on the bed spread. I was very upset at this point. So I stripped... More"
"902",4,"Great location walking distance close to all down town ....bathroom too small, the rest was ok. The restaurant was not working so we had to go to other places around for meals.... People were vey nice"
"903",5,"The accommodations were lovely and the view was spectacular. You can go to the 2nd floor and view the personal planes take off. We weren't able to go to their dinner since they are closed on Mondays. 8 min away from downtownThank you for choosing The Hangar Hotel for your anniversary! We hope it was the best one yet. We appreciate you taking the time to post your review. Come back and visit us soon!"
"904",5,"Rooms were clean, comfy, relaxing on the balcony listening to the creek.Everything was great, had a great time.Service was excellent. If I had more time We would of stayed longer. Coming back in June. Yeay!"
"905",3,"Bad: The fact that the Casino was being renovated and not in use, and that we weren't notified about this prior to arrival. An extra tax being applied to our charges. To call this establishment a resort is simply untrue. No laundry facilities available. No exhaust fan in bathroom. A limit as to how cool the air-con could be set. Good: The size and set-up of our room was very good. The location in regards to the stripwas approx 500 metres away."
"906",4,"The hotel itself is lovely and the staff were very kind and helpful. Just a couple of downsides the shower gel was low throughout our stay and you could get hardly any out i was a bit surprised this wasn't checked during housekeeping. The shower itself also wasn't very powerful. We had a clock in the room but it wasn't showing the right time and appeared to be out of battery didnt think this looled very good. The air conditioning was quite noisy but you could get a good temperature. We enjoyed our stay though as i said just a few minor things."
"907",4,"The hotel was very clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful in planning downtown activities. The location is not great, we didn't have a pretty view of anything from our room, but it was still only a quick $10 cab ride to downtown."
"908",4,"I live close by, and needed to stay somewhere for a night due to renovation work at home. I called at 9:30 PM, and they had a room available. It was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The bed was very comfortable, and we had a sound night's sleep. The check in was smooth, and seeing wild turkeys in he tree out... More"
"909",3,"The staff are friendly and they made sure check in and out went smooth. The room is a little dated and muggy, but it has a nice bed and was clean.

"912",4,"I visited the Suncoast Hotel Casino in Las Vegas last weekend and was pleasantly suprised. The rooms are clean and the rates are great!I live in Las Vegas for my second home, and many times I bring friends to gamble here in Las Vegas. They all can't stay at my home, so we usually look for a local hotel and casino to stay at that is affordable.The Suncoast had great restaurants, clean rooms and winning slot machines at a low price.The only drawback I had was that as a non-smoker, the casino needs better ventiliation. It was very smoky in the casino area.Highly recommended!William Mahoney"
"913",5,"Close to the river with shops and restaurants. Uber/taxi over and enjoy yourself for the night. They used to have a great full breakfast included but now it costs 16-bummer. Staff is helpful and polite. You are 10 minutes to downtown Napa."
"914",2,"We were planning a visit to the Corning museum of glass so figured we would pay more for a better bed and get plenty of sleep for our day long adventure. Was so dissapointed as the beds at this Hampton are not premium beds at all. This was by far the worst night sleep we had on our recent 10... More"
"915",4,"Staff replaced key card when we lost the original set. A little tricky to find the hotel, but very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the continental breakfast buffet was very good. Only con was that the furniture was a little scuffed."
"916",4,"A friend of mine always books the cheapest, bare bones hotels when he travels. He says he'd rather spend money on doing things than on where he stays. I wholeheartedly disagree!! To me, where I stay IS part of my overall traveling experience. So, when we happened upon the Kalispell Grand Hotel, an historic gem in downtown Kalispell, Montana, I... More"
"917",4,"My husband and I stayed here one night on our way to Santa Fe. The hotel is nice and on the west side of town. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Having a small fridge was nice. The front desk folks were very friendly. We would stay here again."
"918",4,"Very friendly staff and good location (free parking and free shuttle). Nearby highway overpass and road noise was a concern on my side of the hotel, but it is convenient, clean, inexpensive, and with very friendly and helpful desk staff -- they are so nice!"
"919",5,"My stay here was excellent!! Clean rooms great staff. The best part of my stay was Cynthia. She is such a go get her. She will help you with anything you need. Made me feel right at home. That's the kind of service I expect when I stay at any hotel. Thanks again."
"920",4,"We had a great time on Whiskey Row. The rooms are small, but what do you need a lot of room for I LOVED THE CLAW TUB. I wish I had known they had bubble bath at the desk because I really wanted to take a bubble bath. We were there during the week and at night, there was tons... More"
"921",3,"This is a very nice property for tourists, but business travelers should look elsewhere. The internet service is very poor. So, if you have to work in your room at night and require internet access, this will not be a good choice for you. Also, I have never been to a hotel that does not get NBC on the TV - one of the major networks. I was going to inform the management of my concerns, but when I checked out, no one asked me how was your stay, so I didn't bother."
"922",2,"There was much to be desired. Air cond. didn't work well. No cups in bathroom. The housekeeping employees woke us up. we were not ready to get up before 8 A.M."
"923",3,"Had to catch a very early flight out of PHX, and this was the closest hotel we found. It actually was clean, comfortable and close to the airport enough."
"924",5,"I book a room every year at this time for the Rendezvous usually at the Brisbois Motel.Oh my, I said no way. After trying hotel after hotel, we came here. I was very upset and the lady at the front desk said everything will be fine. She got us in , then was waiting to see if we was going... More"
"925",3,"Bad: Booked through booking.com and my reservation wasn't sent to the Sheridan, so when I got there, they had no record of my stay. Sheridan was very accommodating, a tad expensive, but stayed because other family members were there. Very clean. Doesn't have curb appeal, but the inside looks up to date and modern. Went to the hotel bar for a drink and some apps - Sauvignon Blanc didn't taste like sauvignon blanc, cheese platter had more meats than cheese, meatballs were rubbery, waitress was very nice. Breakfast at the same place was great. Easy check out. Good: Booked through booking.com and my reservation wasn't sent to the Sheridan, so when I got there, they had no record of my stay.

We had many choices and I choose the cheapest place. I have no regrets. As others have mentioned, the showers were not the hottest, the lobby was dingy but so what. The... More"
"927",1,"Dirty hotel with questionable people living in the hotel."
"928",2,"Nice staff, room almost too small to turn around in. Kind of dirty feeling, bed should've been replaced five years ago. Can hear every noise next door and in the hall."
"929",1,"The airline put me here when weather delayed my flight and I missed the connection. The place is not well maintained in general. I will put up with a lot, but when a dozen cockroaches run out of the room when I opened the door, I'm out. This place should be condemned."
"930",5,"Bad: That I had to leave great place. Good: Everything very nice room food service"
"931",2,"Bad: The hotel room did not meet expectations. There was shaved hair in the shower (did not belong to us) and the water did not get hot. It took 10 minutes of running the water to even get to a somewhat comfortable temperature. It was requested for our two rooms to be beside each other and that request was unable to be met. Finally, when my child got sick with the flu, they were unwilling to work with me on the two nights I paid for and lost because she was sick. Good: Location and pool"
"932",5,"This is the 4th time we have stayed at this location and it is wonderful. Breakfast, wifi and a pool. Its also near all kinds of stores and food! Just fantastic. The staff are also very sweet and caring. :)"
"933",5,"My Husband and I stayed here last week after returning from a week long cruise out of Charleston. I usually stay at Marriott's or Hilton properties but thought we would try Holiday Inn Express. We were pleasantly surprised! This is a very nice property that has obviously just been renovated. The lobby was beautifully done, as were the rooms and breakfast areas. The staff all seemed eager to help and please. The General Manager seems like she is doing a great job and is hands on as I saw her at the Front Desk on a few occasions talking to staff and interacting with guests. I really appreciated the fact that they had laundry facilitites there to use also, considering we had a lot of dirty laundry from the cruise.The free breakfast was also a bonus as it wasn't your usual boring continental breakfast offerings. They had different items on each of the mornings we were there. Some were: Omelettes, sausage, biscuits, bacon and warm cinnamon buns! The coffee was great (and I am fussy with my coffee!) and they even had a pancake machine.While the location wasn't right downtown we did get a reasonable rate and there was a FREE trolley service right at the side of the hotel. We didn't use the car, instead just jumped on the trolley and were in downtown Charleston in no time!"
"934",5,"We really enjoyed our overnight visit at the Hilton Garden. The staff was very attentive and my daughter and I felt like we were home. My only disappointment was that we had to pay for breakfast. It wasn't that great, and I felt that it should have been included."
"935",5,"Came to visit Miami with friends relatively last minute. Flew in FLL. Very packed weekend w/ the Ultra Music fest Spring Break going on.

"937",3,"Overall our stay was decent. However, I would've rated it higher if the indoor pool was clean and usable. It was GREEN and smelled unkept which was disappointing with 2 children. In addition, the bathroom could've been cleaner. The toilet bowl was cleaned and the shower curtain was moldy. On a positive note, the staff was EXTREMELY friendly and the complimentary breakfast was quite yummy"
"938",5,"We couldn't be happier with our stay at Hyatt House Seattle.

"940",5,"This is NOT your typical hotel that allows pets. It is exactly what you'd expect from the Hilton/Hampton brand. Clean, lovely dcor and bedding. I highly recommend this motel and wish there were more like it so we could travel with our pet without lowering our expectations."
"941",3,"This is a condo resort. We rented a studio, which meant that the bedroom, living area and kitchen were all in one. That suited us fine. The lanai was adequate for us.

"949",1,"A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel."
"950",3,"We were in the Buffalo area and needed an unexpected spot to crash for the night. Room was clean. It's an older motel so keep that in mind. Nothing boutique or special.

"976",5,"Bad: (Valet) parking is expensive. Room was a bit small. Good: Very pleasant experience. The room was good, clean and had a rich minibar. Very nice bar/restaurant/breakfast accomodation. Personell (we were helped by luckas) was extraordinary kind and helpful."
"977",5,"We enjoyed every minute of our stay in this breathtaking luxurious resort. The hotel is well kept and boasts caring and attending staff that do their best to make your stay memorable.

"979",5,"Le St.-Rgis est incroyable. What a gorgeous hotel and what an upscale experience you will live by staying there. It was a dream come true. And if it wasn't enough, I bumped into Kate Mara in the elevator. I tried to act cool but totally failed. The rooms are perfect. The staff is perfect. Every square inch is clean and every detail was taken care of. I was lucky enough to have dinner in La Salle de Bal. It was fantastic. Thank you to the FPA for everythingDear PIERRE-YVES L, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning! We would love to have you as our guest in the future!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"980",3,"Overall the hotel, area and staff are nice. But my first stay at this hotel was in December only to find that we had tiny ants all over our room, including our suitcase the next morning...YUCK! The hotel was very apologetic and offered me a free stay next time we were in the area. I took them up on the offer and would have thought the room they put me in would have been checked first, but yep you guessed it...ants again (in February and on a completely different floor)! I think it's time they called an exterminator! They moved me to a different room, but offered nothing else. Won't go back."
"981",5,"Very clean, near DC. Breakfast very good. Easy to locate, staff was friendly. Only I did not have time to try the pool."
"982",4,"Better than expected for the price point. The breakfast that was provided offered many choices."
"983",2,"There was no airport shuttle and It was a little run down"
"984",4,"Just a one night stopover - Clean room, nice pool, friendly staff, adequate breakfast, not the best beds. I expect better beds from a Best Western. It was pretty good value for the price. Would stay again."
"985",4,"Bad: When two people sleep in the bed you settle to the middle of bed and makes for a uncomfortable night's rest. Good: The hotel location and the room layout and scenery was very nice."
"986",5,"We have stayed here several times and it is always the same, clean, quiet, not too expensive. Although it did cost 20 bucks a night now for a dog. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The breakfast is pretty good too."
"987",4,"Bad: No pool or jacuzzi. Good: Location, clean"
"988",5,"Good: Wonderful location. Fantastic staff. Beautiful Art Deco building."
"989",5,"Stayed in 2/2 with ocean view. Spacious with full kitchen. Balcony is quite ample with doors that open the whole thing up A fave feature. Comfy bed sheets. Very good and friendly staff. Great snorkeling reef out front (bring reef shoes). How can you miss with Dukes on premise Everything we had there was excellent. Very nearby market and... More"
"990",5,"Excellent accommodations, excellent staff, super super breakfast in the morning, with everything you can imagine. Stay at this hotel you will be happy! Easy access to the highway, easy access to many venues. Very clean, the staff was very welcoming when I arrived!"
"991",5,"Room is a little bit spendy at close to 200/night but it's a nice big room with a desk and a couch. Looks like a junior suite but it doesn't have the 2nd TV in front of the couch. If there's a negative it's that you can hear some traffic noise outside the windows. Get a higher floor to mitigate.... More"
"992",2,"Very dissatisfied with the staff and the lack of caring about at least 5 different guest (that we know of) not being able to check in until after 5:00 pm because rooms weren't ready. It's a Holiday weekend you would think they would be staffed a little better. They are less than a mile away from a theme park and should no how busy they would be especially on a holiday."
"993",5,"This hotel is awesome! The grounds, pools, tennis courts, ping pong tables and fitness center are very well maintained. All the staff are excellent and so helpful. The food at all 3 restaurants is excellent and the service fantastic. The beds are super comfy and the shower is so relaxing."
"994",5,"Very helpful and friendly staff, who upgraded the room, even though they could not see from their notes that it should accomodate 5 persons. They also gave very good advice regarding restaurants and nearby attractions like Six Flags in LA county. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The breakfast room was also very tidy and had plenty of space. There as also a nice pool there (which we did not make use of). Very good value for money. It also had a convenient location for us, close to Camarillo's attractions as well as other places within driving distance, like for example LA, Santa Barbara, Malibu and Solvang. The business room was also very useful, and things were in order."
"995",4,"We stopped here on our way to drop our son off at Yale after a long day of traveling. Hotel was clean, quiet and well appointed. Couldn't ask for anything more. There are not a lot of restaurants directly near other than a Waffle House and a local drive in. So plan to drive for food or carry in."
"996",5,"This is very pleasant hotel on the Sout side of town. Not far from the college but far enough away where it is quiet and peaceful. Right beside the loop. Good breakfast and nice rooms. A little older but remodeling has upgraded it."
"997",4,"I was pleasently surprised with the quality of the room and it's location. It was quite literally 3 minutes drive time from the Washington Monument and 10 minutes walk time from the metro. The staff was very helpful and the room large. It had a mini kitchen complete with stove, fridge microwave and sink. If I needed an inexpensive place to stay in DC for the week and didn't want to have to eat out every night this would be the place. It's age was showing, carpet stains, peeling wallpaper etc, but the staff was excellent and the rooms very comfortable. No one's home is perfect and this hotel isn't either, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay and can handle it not being absolutely perfect you'll be very happy with Virginian Suites."
"998",4,"Wasn't expecting much from this hotel due to the low rate, however the staff was very organized. I called earlier in the day to let them know I would not be arriving until 11pm. The front desk staff had my key and paperwork sitting out when I arrived. I was in the room in a few minutes.The room itself, had a real king size comfortable bed in it. The room was decorated well. The bathroom was neat, a shower with just a glass wall.The restaurant and bar were very nice, although I only went to the free continental breakfast.The hotel looks like it was updated within 10 years, but then has had alot of use.Only room issues were the shower and bathroom drywall had taking a beating with the lack of a shower curtain, it should be fixed. Looks like the maintenance staff just threw some spackle and painted over the water damage.My room faced the highway, so it was rather loud all night, however the AC was loud enough to drown out the noise. If you stay more than one night I would suggest getting a room facing the other way. The TV only has basic channels, no HBO or Showtime."
"999",1,"We have eaten at many other McMenamins before so for my son's birthday we chose the one in McMinnville since we were there for a track meet at Linfield. BIG MISTAKE!!!! Order was screwed up with two meals not delivered until everyone else was through waiters changed in the middle, and the bill charged us one meal too much. Not happy."
"1000",5,"This is a family owned operation. The owners themselves see to your needs. Dan Jenson even helped us carry our luggage to the room when we arrived. We stayed in the Penthouse, which was phenomenal. The pictures on line do not do it justice. At first, I was hesitant to go to a place that does not have room service,... More"
"1001",5,"Very close to the Soco District and St Edward's University which was convenient since we were there to visit the school. Looks brand new. Rooms were spacious and super clean."
"1002",5,"Stayed in this hotel last week. The manager and staff were very nice and friendly. The room was clean (even behind stuff), the bed was comfortable, and it was quiet. The hotel offered lots of extras for free such as free hot breakfast, drinks in the evening, hot dinner, and long distance calls. While the food was bland and tastelss, it was there for anyone that did not want to go out for decent tasting food. The bartender poured good drinks and it was a good opportunity to meet some of the other hotel guests and the hotel staff. The manager made it a point to stop at tables and talk to guests and get to know them. All-in-all it was an excellent stay and very good value! The only item that could be considered a complaint was that even with the heat off my room was hot. I had to turn the AC on to get a comfortable temp."
"1003",1,"I would advice not to go for this hotel. The staff is higly rude and they will over charge u. Very un proffessional behaviour will keep u waited un ncessary."
"1004",5,"The hotel was very clean. It was in a nice, safe neighborhood. The staff was friendly and polite. The breakfasts were better than most hotels. I broke my leg on the ski slope and the assistant manager went OUT OF HIS WAY to help me!!!"
"1005",5,"This Hampton Inn is one of the friendliest hotels. It is clean, well run, and centrally located. In particular, Diana at the front desk was exceptional! She is always smiling, and willing to help in any way. We always stay at this hotel when visiting Tampa Bay Downs, and would highly recommend it."
"1006",2,"Just stayed as had to catch a flight at BWI airport after a long drive. I would rate this a 2 star hotel."
"1007",3,"Right off the interstate, over priced for the rooms and their current condition. Rug in the room stained and room smelled moldy. Checked out early...."
"1008",5,"Alfonso has the best smile... Great way to start my day every morning as I head for the free coffee and breakfast. I've thoroughly enjoyed my stay here... Even the house keeping staff is friendly and helpful as well as the maintenence guys, especially Tonya and Linda who both introduced themselves to me. Kelly (don't know if I'm spelling his... More"
"1009",4,"we requested a non-smoking room and our assigned only room available reeked of cigarette smoke. The bathroom had mold around the tub, and the carpeted floor were dirty."
"1010",4,"We stayed in a small queen room for 2 nights. The room is small, but comfortable. I will say, however, that the bed is on the hard side and not the most comfortable. The sheets have a papery feel to them as well. But the pillows are fluffy. Not the typical hotel bed where you feel like you're sleeping on clouds, but it does the trick, I suppose. Still, all in all, the staff is friendly and the location is really convenient if you'll be spending time downtown. The room is quiet and the wifi is free. It's also affordable. Based on that, I recommend it.Dear Ann C,Thank you for your recommendation! We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback about your recent experience.We look forward to welcoming you back in the future."
"1011",4,"stayed in Saco with some co workers, some pretty good restaurants near the hotel, and close enough to get to Portland next day, get business done and hit a good restaurant ion PORTLAND! stayed in two other similar hotels this trip, service here was really accommodating and friendly, nice touch"
"1012",4,"Stayed here after a day visiting the Gulf Coast beaches. It was easy to find with many restaurants and other stores in the area. The staff was friendly and pleasant. The room was spacious and clean. Excellent breakfast. Our only complaint is that the walls are so thin we could hear our neighbors."
"1013",3,"My family and I stayed here one night pre-cruise. I was only looking for a decent place to lay our heads for the night and I guess this fit the bill. I should've known what I was getting for the price but I was being optimistic. Cons: The room smelled musty and damp but I guess we got used to... More"
"1014",4,"We didn't stay overnight, but rented the room so that my daughter and her friends could get ready for prom a few blocks away. Just so everybody knows...her dad and I were in the room at ALL times; no kids were left unsupervised. Her date needed a place to get ready because he had performed at a nearby arts event that ran right into Prom time, so he needed someplace close. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. We got some really wonderful pictures; my favorite was when the kids were reaching for the chandelier and it looked like they were reaching for falling stars. The staff helped us stage some really cool shots, and were just fantastic. The room was very clean and comfortable with plenty of mirror space and plug ins for curling irons; the window added lots of good, natural light. Lots of closet space let the kids get ready for after prom without too much problem.The only negative I have is that the hotel shuttle was not available, although when I called earlier in the week to make sure it was, I was assured that it would be available and that I didn't need a reservation. We had to scramble for rides to prom, which worked, but was a last minute stress we hadn't planned on having."
"1015",2,"First of all they say they don't rent rooms to florida residents unless you put up a deposit but they don't tell you this until you get there when it is to late to cancel or make another res somewhere else.

"1016",2,"Old run down furniture, room needed to be repainted, peeling paint, curtains ripped and dirty, carpet ok, but room was not as clean as it should be.

Facility itself is nice with attractive lobby, pool, convenient."
"1017",5,"This hotel is nice with really beautiful grounds and views from our room. They have a fantastic nature trail. Our room was nice and large. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It's also close to the airport. We also liked the free parking option. We enjoyed The restaurants and large bar on the property also. Good food and drinks!... More"
"1018",5,"For the cost of this hotel, I was extremely surprised on how nice, clean and modern looking it was. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful with anything we needed, but most importantly I felt comfortable there because it was safe and secure and the inside and outside was well kept. I also found out it was recently remodeled. Would def stay there again."

"1021",1,"Bad: The eatery was very expensive, not many choices, it was freezing cold in the hallways, it was noisy, the toilet leaked, and when it wasn't leaking it was running. Called for maintenance but no one came. Tub was dirty. Not impressed at all."
"1022",5,"Bad: Short on hot water during the evening. It was fine during the morning hours. When I mentioned this at the desk they promised to look into it and adjusted my bill to compensate. Good: Very clean, attractive. Good value for the money."
"1023",5,"I was very concerned after reading the reviews. I also refuse to pay 300/night for a hotel in which I am only looking for a place to sleep pre-cruise. So I took my chances on this hotel at 95/night....and I am SO glad I did. After getting our luggage at the airport, I called the hotel for the free shuttle.... More"

When you first get here it does't look or seem like your ordinary hotel from the outside. However, The Hotel hostess were extremely nice, The room was awesome, the bed slept great, room was comfort and cosey, if i decided to cook in the kitchen i could have. Great area, and you can walk to Iwo Jima memorial, or walk to Rosslyn area to eat. I will return with fam friends in spring time....."
"1031",4,"Great location for walking distance to the Atlanta Aquarium, World of Coke, CNN Center, and Centennial Park. MARTA station is a 10-15 minute walk. Legal Sea Food in the building. Unlike the Embassy Suites next door, the HGI does NOT include complementary breakfast."

"1035",3,"Check in is easy. Close to gas stations and food. Room for truck and RV parking. Rooms are basic and hotel clean. Wifi is good and continental breakfast is good. Pet friendly. I stay here 2-3 times per year and it's a solid hotel, I feel safe and the accommodations are what I would expect for the price."
"1036",4,"The lobby was small, but modern. The valet and check in staff were great. We had a package that included breakfast. We ordered and put both orders on one slip (Why waste paper), but the hotel charged us for one breakfast because they were not written on TWO separate tickets. The food was not so great. Pre-cooked and microwaved. Not worth the money. The room was great, but we had a corner room. The waterpressure could have been better. Overall, not too bad. Not my first choice for a NOLA hotel, but would consider it again if I had to.Glad you had a great time overall here with us at Aloft NOLA. We appreciate your feedback and are always looking for ways to improve. Like most Aloft's, our breakfast options are grab and go items aimed at quick and convenient service. On a brighter note, those corner rooms are great and offer fantastic views on the Crescent City.

"1038",3,"Bad: The entire place smells like an ashtray. The rooms were small and the place is noisy. It's a complete freak show under the canopy---ugly people who are 90 nude with no talent. Wall to wall beggars and hawkers. The entire Las Vegas is full of annoying street hustlers and creeps. What a waste of our First Amendment Rights! Next time I go to LV, I will stay in a South Vegas Hotel, go to a show and leave the next day. Too bad Vegas is stuck with such a beggar and homeless problem. Good: It was on my bucket list and I wanted to experience the canopy light show---ok, check it off. Good deals on food: Tony Roma's is located within the Fremont Hotel and steak and lobster for 11.99 is a DEAL! The Valet Parking was free and excellent. The entire Staff was excellent but seemed embarrassed to be in such a dump. It was cheap but you pay for it if your not a smoker."

It was nice to be able to relax on the balcony.We had an issue with the thermostat and maintenance came up promptly--turns out it was operator error! Asked for extra towels one evening and they were brought up immediately. On Tuesdays and Saturdays there is a nice Farmer's Market just a few yards away (I believe it closes in October until next season). A grocery store within walking distance. We definitely recommend!Dear PeggyS513,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback, as well all the great things you mentioned about our friendly staff and comfortable beds. Our balcony rooms do have a different thermostat unit than the others and typically we do get calls about them not operating. Unfortunately you do need to be within so many feet of the unit for it to operate properly and this typically take care of the issue. The farmer's market is definitely coming to an end, I would anticipate it to end come November. We're glad to hear that you recommend us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar."

"1064",5,"My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue. The staff was very accommodating and interesting. The location is centrally located and convenient. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it. If you're looking for something unusual, this is it.

"1066",5,"Stayed here on an April Saturday night. Check-in was easy. Lobby was spotless and front desk staff were courteous, friendly and fast. My room was very large even by Hampton standards. The hotel looks fairly new so everything was in tip top shape. The next morning, a housekeeper greeted me in the hall and asked how my stay was and... More"
"1067",4,"Me and my partner stayed at the Motel 6 Downtown Atlanta beginning of september 2015. We were visiting Atlanta for a couple days as we were on route to Fort Lauderdale and slept 2 night at the Motel 6.The Motel 6 is excellent value for money! Rooms are clean with a nice bathroom. Our room also had a small balcony where you can relax in the morning and evenings when it is not to hot outside...Check in staff was very polite and check in went very smooth. Also a plus is that you can get free coffee at the reception area every morning from about 7am. That is very easy when you arrive 'jet laged' from Europe and wake up much to early each morning -)Location of the Motel 6 is perfect because you can do all the tourist places like the Coca Cola museum, the Olypic parc etc by foot.They also have a car park at site at no extra cost, so that was also very easy to park our rental car there.Overal the Motel 6 downtown is a basic but very good motel in downtown Atlanta with clean rooms and friendly staff. I will surely stay here again when visiting Atlanta!"
"1068",5,"Our 1st time in Maui was a welcome surprise. This was the start of our six week USA holiday. Spent 4 night and it turned out to be the perfect start to our trip. Highly recommend the Best Western Pioneer Inn in Lahania. It is situated right on the harbour. Cannot stress enough that you should try to book a... More"
"1069",4,"I liked the proximity to the ball park. It wasn't a bad walk at all even with a toddler. There is a parking garage for 10 a day diagonally across the street. Even walking back from the ball park at night wasn't bad. The hotel rooms are smaller than the norm but good for the price! There isn't complimentary breakfast or anything like that but there is a cafe one block over. They do have valet parking as well and seemed to be pretty quick. The employees were very friendly. Checking in and out was a breeze-the desk attendant was there to help with the self check in."
"1070",4,"The room had trash in the trash can and there was quite a bit of debris along the edge of the walls. Bed was comfortable."
"1071",4,"Previous reviewers have nailed it....nice property, good location, attractive but crowded pool with tons of kids. We did swim at the beach right by the resort but there's not really a big enough flat area to set up/relax there. Rented via vrbo and got a decent price. Actually enjoyed our mountain view quite a bit- fun to watch the sun... More"
"1072",4,"The folks here have paid attention to detail and made this a wonderful place to stay. There is Plenty of room for parking, a nice breakfast, comfortable rooms, easy check in and out. The Great location makes it easy enough to get around without being to close to downtown.Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed your visit.Thanks you for staying with us, hope to see you again soon."
"1073",5,"Get more than what you pay for, Hotel ran well and good atmosphere. Very accommodating."
"1074",1,"I was expecting the type of property from years past, where the quaint experience of Baleens and the exotic decor reigned. Needless to say, it doesn't even resemble what was. The first experience was with a property manager that appeared to come from a different industry, as he was extremely rude and overwhelming. The fancy elegance with the monkey- theme... More"
"1075",5,"We had a great time!! Hotel staff was pleasant and helpful, but not intrusive! Rooms were great. Bed is out of this world comfortable. I will definitely be going back!"
"1076",5,"This hotel is in a good location near Restaurants, grocery and retail stores. Clean rooms with refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, safe, work desk, couch and table. A fair size dining area next to the lobby where complimentary breakfast is served. The dining area is also available to meet family or network w business throughout the day after the breakfast meal.... More"
"1077",3,"Clean rooms with no frills.It is in a good location for walking to shops and bars. It is a little expensive for what you get, big chain budget motels offer more for less cash. The pool was in use when we stayed. there was free coffee available in the office."
"1078",4,"Bad: Uncomfortable beds. Good: Location"
"1079",4,"Bad: Place."
"1080",5,"The hotel and staff were nice but upon check in I was given a double when I requested a KING. About 3 hours into my stay another family was trying to enter my room. It seems that I had been given the wrong room by the front desk attendant. They corrected the matter only after the family went to the... More"
"1081",5,"nice room, located 4 blocks from Pentagon City Mall"
"1082",2,"This motel is definitely not a 3* resort so make sure you know that before booking a room at the Baymont Inn and Suites. The place is pretty shabby and rundown. The room I had needed to be updated -as the sheets were dingy, and the bathtub was old and rusty. The breakfast was so nasty that I had to... More"
"1083",4,"I looked around quite a bit for a decent pet-friendly hotel, and this fit the bill nicely. Everyone is very nice and friendly. The hotel itself is very comfortable and nicely appointed. If you like modern hip vibe design, this is a good place to be. It's close to restaurants and the Japanese Friends Garden, a very large park next door (though not sure why they call it Japanese since nothing about it is Japanese). I only had drinks at the bar and chose to eat across the street at the Moroccan restaurant. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The only drawback about this hotel is the lack of sound proofing. My last morning (Saturday), I was woken very early by the person in the room next door with their music blaring. Also, the music from the bar is very, very loud, and there were several people hanging outside the lobby in front of their car with their music turned up so loud it was shaking the windows. My poor dog was so scared. Also, I was gone all day the first full day there, and came back at 830pm to find my room still had not been cleaned. Minor inconvenience.Hi! Thank you for taking the time to write a review! Glad to hear you and your pup had a comfortable stay. There are actually two parks next to us, and you were most likely in Hance Park, not the Japanese Friendship Garden as there is a fee and the grounds there are built and landscaped just as they are in Japan. Perhaps on your next stay we can get you pointed in the right direction. As far as the noise issues you experienced, we are already looking in to ways we can improve this. We apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused for you and your dog. We will also address the issue with your room to see why it hadn't been cleaned while you were away. Again, thanks for this review and we will use it to improve and hopefully see you again in the future."
"1084",3,"I've been staying here for many years when I take in the Des Moines Operas at Simpson College in Indianola. This is very convenient to the campus and town in general. Reasonably priced. I usually stay 3 nights. Very convenient to Des Moines also."
"1085",5,"Bad: Difficult to find as the name si not visible outside. Breakfast not included. The water in the swimming pool was really too hot. I would sugger to refrigerate it a little... Good: Great location, cozy enviromenment, friendly and helpful staff. Very clean room. I've Aldo seen the Dr Vranjers air perfumer in the reception! Loved this place and his style!"
"1086",5,"Our stay at this Wingate was exceptional! We were greeted with a warm, friendly staff. As a bonus, we received a goody bag of munchies and a water, upon check-in, which was a pleasant surprise."
"1087",4,"PROS: Amazing views from lake view rooms worth extra 10! Great location close to Space Needle and great restaurants in Lower Queen Anne. We walked to Space Needle and City Center in 15 minutes, it's about 1.1 miles. If you include parking, it is faster to walk. The newly completed MOHI is right across the street, which is well worth the price of admission - we spent half a day there. Great, friendly customer service from front desk staff (Marriott 800-number, not so much.) Now that construction is complete on Mercer access to downtown and the freeway is a piece of cake. Free evening (after 9am-4pm) and weekend parking right across the street (vs 27/night garage parking). CONS: Marriott reservations gave me a hard time trying to get a cheaper rate that came available. Water in room is 3.00. Candy bar in market is 3.50 and they have removed the vending machines. Two cans of beer in market were 14 (the price of 12 a the store). Bistro menu is pretty short. We were not sure if there was any breakfast room service because there was only a dinner menu in our room. Power button on TV remote did not work, but channel changer and volume did.WEIRD: I have never seen a green flushing toilet that used so much water!!! The flushes were torrential. More than my standard toilet at home by double.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your recent experience at our hotel on Trip Advisor! I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, particularly the view from your room! We love the changes that have been taking place in the South Lake Union neighborhood, particularly now that the roadwork is complete. I did want to share that while we do offer room-delivery for dinner, our breakfast is only available in the Bistro. However we are happy to package anything on the menu to-go if needed!We hope you will choose our hotel again next time your travels bring you to Seattle.Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor"
"1088",4,"Bad: Old, not many outlets. Good: Location and price."
"1089",5,"This was a very pleasant resort. We were only able to stay one night, but would have loved to stay longer. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Excellent choice, and pet friendly!"
"1090",5,"We had an amazing time and love it there. Quaint cottages, beautiful pool and a fun game room. The family who owns it is incredibly sweet. Overall I'd rate it a 10 if I could. The beds were comfy, everything was clean, the tables and outside chairs make it a great place to relax and enjoy the fresh air."
"1091",5,"We were very pleased with our stay. Its worth getting a water view. It has a great view of the bay from the balcony. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. The price is great compared to other water view hotels, and it was worth it. We were a little worried something would be lacking, but that was not the... More"
"1092",4,"Needed to be close to the airport and not overpay. Hotel was in the right place for the right price. Very clean, friendly staff and lots of shopping and restaurants. Had to leave before breakfast was served so can't review that."
"1093",5,"I was very pleased staff was very professional but also friendly and helpful. I loved the bar and cookies and tea were nice too. Staff helped me out with a late check out. Excellent hotel!!Great location!"
"1094",4,"I was a little worried from the outside and the lobby but I was very happy with the room. The breakfast was nothing to write home about. The proximity to everything I wanted to do was good. I would stay again."
"1095",4,"Great rooms for the price and great breakfast compared to the usual continental. Shuttle service to the Metro line very useful. Great way to travel to the downtown area and even to the airport."
"1096",4,"My fiance and I came here to celebrate our engagement (he proposed on the trip). We absolutely loved the room. Ours had a glass curtain wall which could be folded away so the entire room was open to the outside. It was gorgeous. The room's were well-appointed and the staff was friendly. We were surprised, however, by the 25 a... More"
"1097",5,"Bad: Room servicing late in the day. Good: Great hotel. Friendly staff."
"1098",4,"Our 1 bedroom suite was just right for my husband, daughter and me. We had enough space to spread out. We stay at Candlewood whenever we are visiting family in NJ. We like the kitchen with the full size refrigerator and microwave, dishwasher and two burner stove. We like the free laundry but it is not a place to go... More"
"1099",2,"We booked and paid in full a month in advance. We arrived late to be greeted by front desk telling us we had no room available. It was common practice to overbook. We spent 2 of our 3 days moving from hotel to hotel as a result. They did not even call us ahead of time to tell us to check In elsewhere.  Instead of a refund for the inconvienance the Manager gave us 2 free drink tickets and offered a free nights stay later. Horrible custom service and practice!"
"1100",5,"This extended stay accommodation is perfect. The location of the hotel will take you to any point in the DC Metropolitan The greatest thing in this hotel is the staff lead by Ms. Julia Hanson-Takyi, General Manager. Julia is very helpful person. She is outstanding in serving the customers. She always doing her best to make the stay comfortable and... More"
"1101",3,"Good, basic accommodations to take a break while driving up the East Coast from Florida to NY. Asked for and got a quiet double for a reasonable rate upon arrival. Breakfast effort is better than the actual offerings."
"1102",5,"This place is great! The service is incredibly friendly and welcoming. The free breakfast is delicious and on weekdays they have fresh baked cookies in the evenings. I come back anytime I'm in Ashland."
"1103",1,"Pigsty. Room wasn't cleaned they claimed to only have smoking rooms available. Rowdy drunks till 3am."
"1104",3,"The hotel is clean, size of the room was good and the pool area is nice, but the overall look of the place is cheesy, the AC in the room was noisy and hard to control, and there's no free internet! Worse than that, they have a tiered internet pricing scheme that went up to 40 for 2 days!"
"1105",4,"I stayed this hotel for 4 days to travel washington dc. Its locations is pretty good to go convenient facilities. However, if your purpose of visiting dc is to travel, you need to have a car. I would stay here next visiting dc."
"1106",4,"nice hotel 15 minutes from DC. clean with nice pool in nice neighbourhood. small bed. bad breakfast"
"1107",5,"This place is great it has a great breakfeast clean rooms and Free wifi. Would Def stay here again. Thanks"
"1108",3,"Bad: Advertised as Hotel, Casino Spa but there was no casino. Very disappointed. Good: Restaurant staff were very attentive and food was good"
"1109",5,"Clean, comfortable and quiet room, convenient shuttle to airport, AND they let me leave my car in their lot while I traveled. Good price, too. Perfect."
"1110",3,"For the it was OK, I would stay again, the TV is an off brand and Made some noise on some channels, breakfast is OK, but nothing to write Home about frozen egg Mc muffins. I would give it 3 stars max"
"1111",4,"The rooms were clean, well air-conditioned and large, with good bathrooms, basic cable TV and wireless Internet access. There's also a computer in the reception area. The desk service was very helpful and polite. There's a medium-sized outdoor pool. The complimentary breakfast includes many items, and you can make your own waffles. There is a shuttle bus until 10 pm to the metro stop, which is the last stop on the line. It takes 30-45 minutes to get to the center of Washington. The shuttle can fill up, and can take a while to pick you up. We did find parking at the metro stop lot, but that can fill up."
"1112",2,"The hotel is listed as near Bricktown. I guess that would depend on your definition of near. Near to me would be near the Pilot truckstop as it was next door. Our room was clean, but you could walk to the pool an see other rooms that were not. Many had mattresses propped up against the wall, and almost all the second floor rooms had pillows stuffed in the a/c units. You could see all this through the windows of the parking lot because lots of the sliding glass door curtains were open or missing pieces. It honestly looked like they were fixing it one room at a time. I don't know how old the hotel is, but it is far from being completely renovated. I think hotels.com should do more research on the hotels they show with a 4 star rating. The two star the hotel showed was more accurate."
"1113",5,"Loved everything about the place and especially loved the quilt and pillows. People were very friendly. We will be staying there again in the future. I can't wait to use the pool next time too. I'm asking for the quilt for xmas."
"1114",3,"Bad: Getting the wrong key to check in the key they gave us was somebody else's room, and spoiled coffee creamer not fun getting dressed to go downstairs and get a cuppa coffee."
"1115",4,"Our go-to place when visiting family in UT. We've stayed at several hotels in Salina within a mile of I-70, and this is the best value. Consistently great service, and an indoor pool with heated jacuzzi that we always enjoy. There are plenty of choices with the complimentary Breakfast. You can't beat what you get for 50."
"1116",5,"This may be the best motel I have ever stayed in. My wife still wants to go back so we can sleep in the bed again. Very nice!"
"1117",5,"I found this hotel to be clean, fresh in appearance, and comfortable. I would recommend this hotel. It was good to have a restaurant on-site and we found the food to be quite good. No complaints. Thank you for the stay."
"1118",1,"Bad: Please take heed to this warning do not stay here. My car along with 3 other guest cars staying at this hotel were broken into overnight. The hotel didnt try to make us feel more safe or accommodate us.. They do not care at all. If you are trying to save money dont chance it by staying here unless you want your car broken into and you want your property stolen. It's not worth it you are better off staying in another hotel. This ruined our trip and we didn't feel safe staying there and management doesnt care at all also.. There is no security gaurds or cameras on this property so ask yourself if you want to be next. ."
"1119",5,"It was very easy to reach the airport with free transportation and a on site restaurant to get a quick meal early in the am.i"
"1120",4,"Clean, shopping near by, very pleasant staff, would stay here again"
"1121",4,"Really enjoyed our stay ! Was clean! Breakfast was a little confusing with how to pay for it and get the kids breakfast for free. Had to ask a couple different people. But it was a great value. Would stay again."
"1122",1,"Very old hotel that caters to low class clientele. Being near Disneyland, this hotel is a fly trap to families who cannot afford something nicer. There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are extremely sorry for the experience you had at our hotel. This is not something normal. I am also suprised our staff did not address the issue immediately. W hope you will give us another chance in the future to win back your business."
"1123",5,"This hotel is a dream! I visit the hotel to get a break from home and family and to relax. I stay for two days, and don't even leave the hotel!! I love the rooms, the luxurious bedding, the big showers, the swimming pool, the fitness center. It's a wonderful hotel. Great value."
"1124",3,"Small, lackluster, local owned motel literally next door to the Wall Drug and other shops and eateries on Main Street. We stayed here after spending the morning and part of the afternoon in the Badlands. It was very convenient and easy to find, however, don't expect any amenities. Our room was extremely small, old tube 20 TV that sat on... More"
"1125",2,"I was not expecting a room with outside access. I would not have stayed there if I had know what to expect. The description listed the room as not ocean front. It should have stated it was in a separate building and that it was motel style. Air conditioner was located directly below the thermostat and there was one air conditioner and thermostat for both rooms sections in the suite. Could not maintain a comfortable temperature."
"1126",3,"The front desk staff was very pleasant and and helpful. We enjoyed the hot breakfast, internet worked well, and the room was clean but a little on the small size with the cramped sink area. It would be nice if maintenance adjusted the door checks as we grew quite annoyed with other guests that kept letting their doors slam."
"1127",2,"Well first off, I paid for a King with a sofa bed Non-smoking. When I arrived and checked in, once in the room I discovered I had been given a full size bed. I immediately called down to the front-desk and the manager said she was all out of Non-smoking King rooms and that she didn't know why Hotels.com booked me and charged me for that room. I told her I had paid for it already and was told that I would have to take it up with Hotels.com. I was extremely upset and she offered me a Smoking King room. I wasn't comfortable with that but because my two small boys wanted to stay in the hotel (just for the pool) I agreed to the king room smoking. We all have allergies so I was a bit uncomfortable staying there but did it to please my boys."
"1128",1,"Room is disrepair, rude manager, average breakfast. Possible mold on the wallpaper! I which some was falling off. Plus I've never seen anyone put drywall over wallpaper. At least the breakfast lady was friendly and it was quiet. Do they buy their reviews"
"1129",3,"We went there in March with our grandson primarily to visit the aquarium which is right across the street from the hotel. In fact, the tiny balcony on our room directly faced it, much to the pleasure of our 8 year old. The front desk girl when we visited was extremely friendly. She in fact kept an eye on our... More"

Rooms were clean, fridge and microwave in room, nice pool area, it has it all! Staff was friendly and most helpful! Lots to do in the area and would definitely stay here again!"
"1131",3,"Lovely location on a picturesque bluff overlooking a broad, golden beach, this resort hotel's ample grounds were also attractively landscaped. The rooms were nicely decorated and very comfortable. The free continental breakfast was quite ample and there is a 24-hour coffee service in the lobby. All this should have led to a very positive experience BUT...For one, there is no... More"

There is a free buffet breakfast, wine tasting from 5-6pm and a tea/coffee station in reception all day. The pool is heated and the outdoor areas are really well maintained. I had a very relaxing stay and would definitely recommend it.Dear ACNolan,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We are very honored to have earned your recommendation and thankful you enjoyed your stay with us. It's great to hear that you had a relaxing time with us and we hope to see you again soon. Warmest Regards, Serina Najar."
"1152",5,"It was a very lovely stay. The room was so beautiful! Beds so comfy!! Pool was so refreshing!! We will stay again! The thing that was troubling, was check-in with one person, part of information was not correct, when I mentioned this, she stated, well you are staying only one night, Let that go, she did mention it several times. Then was telling us, where the room was, kept pointing behind us and saying right back there, repeating it. We didn't look behind us, so she kept pointing, I said do you want us to look behind us to see where you are pointing Eye roll from her! Breakfast ends at 9 and don't take any food out of that area! Let it go. The best part was she informed us of check out, which was 10, not one minute after, repeated it and do we understand! My patience now about gone, about to ask for a manager and tell her a piece of my mind! My very calm my daughter, who is more patience then I just said thank you and took the keys from her. Walked away, went to our room, went to eat and a dip in the pool, let it that go! The night gentlemen, at your front desk was fabulous, the mini fridge started making noise, and sent someone up. We went to eat the pool, it was looked at it. To bad, that the noise had stop, so we both thought it was fixed. When I said something to the front desk (not same lady) that next morning, she said so very sorry and took the resort fee off. The stay was so very nice, had a beautiful garden area!!! Will stay again!!"

"1157",5,"We love Drury Inns and were pleased with our stay in Atlanta. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean, and spacious. Breakfast, though crowded this day, was good and well stocked. One employee was even helping people make waffles. We were also pleased that we could park for up to 7 days for free (subject to available space). We only had to fill out a form, which did clearly state that the hotel is not liable for any damages. That seemed fair enough, and we had no problems with our car while it was parked at the hotel for 3 nights. The location was very convenient to the airport (right off I-85) and the free shuttle service brought us right back to the hotel in minutes."
"1158",1,"The guest service informed me that my service dog would not be able to stay in the handicap accessible room with me. He offered me a pet friendly room, but it was not accessible. (I use a wheelchair so this was an unreasonable option!) He finally contacted a supervisor, who ok'd staying in the accessible room with my dog. Upon entering the room, the room was very tight. It was nearly impossible to maneuver past the bed. As a matter of fact, I didn't. In the bathroom, the toilet sat on the middle of the wall, nothing as far as grab bars. For a customer with balance issues, this makes it hard to toilet independently. It was frustrating that the room is considered to be accessible! I would be happy to consult with you to ensure that rooms are made accessible!"
"1159",4,"Stay was overall wonderful. Bathrooms could use a little maintenance. We would stay here again. This was an affordable convenient option when you cannot afford to stay waterfront."
"1160",5,"We brought our 6 year old granddaughter to Chicago with us. We have stayed at this hotel at least 6 times and have never been disappointed. The location is perfect for walking to many touristy spots. We even walked to and from union station. Thank you for staying with us recently and for your kind recommendation both are greatly appreciated! We are pleased to hear that you are a great fan of the River Hotel and delighted that your granddaughter had a wonderful stay. We agree -- our prime location in the heart of the city is perfect for experiencing all that Chicago has to offer.We look forward to welcome you back to the River Hotel very soon!"
"1161",5,"The entire excellent experience started with general manager Lourdes Yanouri. We had 7 people in our group (and stayed 3 nights) and she immediately handled all of the reservations and made sure we had all of the confirmations by email. They were waiting on us when we got there - the clerk even knew we were coming. The rooms are... More"
"1162",3,"First off, the bed was super comfortable. But... Room cleanliness could be better, linens stained, breakfast worse than most, on the very end of strip bordering sketchy neighbors. Lots of other choices in area."

"1166",2,"Several of our family members stayed there. We were leaving on a cruise from Seward the next day. Rooms were spacious but dated, and shuttle service from/to the airport was offered.

"1169",4,"Staff was friendly. Breakfast was great, especially the coffee! It was very modern and up to date. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because we requested a non smoking room, and unfortunately the room smelled like cigarette smoke. They did spray the room, but it only improved it slightly."
"1170",5,"We came for one night to go to a Lions game, the staff were great and very friendly, the rooms were spacious, renovated and amazing.

Didn't eat so cannot comment on food. One big let down was housekeeping. Very poor for this level of property. GM knows who I am and they had plenty opportunity to fix it, but never came back. Overall still pleased. But fix room cleanliness and you then merit Marriott Autograph Collection...Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you ended up enjoying your stay but would have loved for you to have a perfect stay. We are taking action to prevent the issues you experienced from occurring again.

"1172",5,"We stayed here on our way East. The room included a a balcony and a Jacuzzi. The bed was super comfortable. The food and room service were exceptional. Hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful."
"1173",4,"Bad: The music in the lobby was horrendous. House music that made me want to die or run away with my hands over my ears. Totally cruel to make the hotel receptionists listen to that all day long and it made the lobby an undesirable place to spend time. They should be playing jazz or something easy on the ears. Good: Location and room/decor, amenities"
"1174",3,"Nice hotel with clean rooms but a very odd location off the Interstate. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was not protected from the abundance of highway noise throughout the night. Additionally, it's not extremely intuitive on how to actually get to the hotel through a very weird access road.

Can't beat the walk to the Aquarium, Childrens Museum and Olympic Park (2 good playgrounds for little ones) Valet parking was 32 bucks a night which we thought was a bit steep but it was very busy in the area surrounding the hotel so parking is scarce.

"1190",2,"Bad value for the price. Room was dirty, carpet stained and curtains torn. Breakfast was adequate, well-prepared. Had to report noisy tenants on the floor above, they finally went to sleep or passed out...not certain staff did anything about the problem. Exterior was littered and needed cleaning up."
"1191",4,"Room was amazing but the breakfast was lacking in selection. The breakfast was free and the quality of what was there was very good. I would stay at this location again if work brought me back trough this area"
"1192",5,"The staff was very friendly and they made check-in super fast. My family and I got there a little early they checked the room and since it was clean they got us in early. One of the best stays I've had in a hotel. We will definitely be staying here again in the future."

"1194",4,"Good location - close to shopping and airport. Comfortable and clean enough, but does need renovation. Good value for the price."
"1195",4,"For the price and location (Burnet) this was a nice place to stay. Rooms are old but have been updated. Clean rooms, friendly staff, pretty good breakfast. It was great for a one night stay, would stay again for similar circumstance."
"1196",4,"I needed a place that was a quick on-and-off the highway to get to my conference. This one was convenient to 495 and 395. I appreciated the free breakfast, and there was a really big selection of good hot and cold food! I needed a break on the room rate because I only work part-time."

I was particularly impressed with Pedro on the front desk, who was cheerful and obliging, and a great ambassador for the hotel. The location is perfect, and the rooms both comfortable and private. Great value for money. I thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.Dear azelinaf2017,Thank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers.

"1202",5,"Your standard Holiday Inn hotel. Wish the chain would remove some of the gimmicks and drop the price, but I get some people enjoy them. It was a pleasant stay, the workers at the desk were very helpful on telling how to get around town on the public transit system and were very kind. Breakfast is solid and there's plenty of room to eat. If we go back to Oregon, we'd consider staying here. Wish the Max went a little farther south closer to it, but that's not the hotel's fault."
"1203",5,"I stay here every chance I get. It is my hotel of choice in San Francisco. The service is always superb and the rooms are amazing. I have pretty high standard when it comes to hotel beds and the InterContinental more than lived up to them. I would recommend it to anyone."

"1224",3,"I was expecting a more welcoming attitude from the reception. Some of them were nice but there is one guy who was very serious and never smiled. I didn't understand if he had a bad time or this is simply his personality. The floor I stayed on had a little bit of unfresh air on the entrance. I stayed before and room condition was better. Also one time shuttle service took more than one hour to arrive for pickup. We waited from 3:30 pm to 4:40 pm we called at 3:20 pm but looks like they skipped one pick-up turn."

"1228",5,"I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about. Consistent and friendly staff that makes The St Regis our home away form home. We really love it.Dear Kenneth,Thank you so much for taking the time to not only share your feedback regarding your most recent visit, but also to be so detailed and generous with your comments about our team members. Molly, Shelomie, Hugo, Krista, McKinley, Marianna, Kevin, and Juan are indeed amongst our most stellar performers and we could not be happier to learn that they made your and Ryne's visit enjoyable and memorable.

Staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful. Rooms are a bit small so wouldn't recommend for more than two people to a room. We would definitely stay here again!"

Not being from the area we didn't no much about the places around us so upon asking the front desk staff (Vanessa) we where given directions to everything we could need.

"1242",5,"Lovely place and very friendly staff. Although no shuttle was available from the Amtrak station, they did offer to send a limo driver. He was waiting for us as promised and charged 25, which seemed very reasonable. Hotel was clean. Breakfast was typical for a free hotel breakfast, nothing outstanding, but certainly more than adequate. Walking distance to key downtown sites."
"1243",4,"comfortable bed. microwave, fridge. sink area separate area from bathroom. Very clean. Did not have breakfast as it ends at 9:30 and we missed it so can't comment. Not a luxury hotel but quiet and great value for the price of 62. night. Convenient to I75."

"1248",5,"All employees were very helpful and polite"
"1249",5,"The rooms are luxurious, the staff are very accommodating, and the casino is not overly crowded. Best of all, the beds are insanely comfy!! The best stay we've had in all the times we've been to Vegas. We will always stay here from now on."
"1250",5,"The staff was very helpful throughout my stay at this hotel. The hotel room was very clean. The breakfast that they serve every morning is great, and is a great deal. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Anaheim."
"1251",4,"First off I'll start with The Saint is an unique boutique hotel that sits on Eaton Street with access to Duval Street. We had booked what they call the petite double I believe and they aren't wrong. My husband paced it out and we figured it was approx 150 square feet. That being said it did have everything you needed and was tastefully done, but you'd never want to stay in it more then a night or two. They had a lovely balcony over looking Duval Street that sadly for us was 1 room away from ours and on NY's Eve they had their party on it . I wish I would have known this in advance as laying in bed after midnight it felt and sounded as if I was still in the middle of the dance floor. That aside I suppose I should have expected that being NY's but I've never been in a hotel especially a Marriott where the party was more important to the guest comfort. They have a lovely bar in the lobby away from the guest rooms which would have been a better and less noisy option for the quests who weren't attending their NYs party. All and all I'd say there are plenty of other choices to stay at in Key West at comparable costs (this wasn't cheap at 448.00 per night for 2 for the smallest room) that would cater more to the comfort of their guests then the 50 dollars a person they made at the NY's party.I apologize for the noise on New Year's Eve. Key West is a hot spot for the holiday and our hotel is known for the balcony countdown party overlooking Duval Street. The rates are comparable to other hotels for that night yet may have not been quieter on this busy day on the island. We hope you will give us another visit on a non-holiday and reserve one of our larger Superior King rooms that will be more comfortable for you. Happy New Year to you and your family."
"1252",5,"Really nice hotel. Room was fresh and clean. Fluffy pillows and comfy bed. Housekeeping was good. I liked , the larger batheroom and shower, the coffee cubie in the bathroom, the shelf under the sink - I used it to tuck my toiletries away, Other notes - front desk person friendly and nice, complimentary breakfast was good and above average...

"1253",5,"Cheap rate for a clean room with comfortable bed. Refrigerator in room for no extra charge. COLD AC. Easy walking distance to a couple convenience stores, fast food, and a local restaurant. Would definitely stay again."
"1254",5,"We were very impressed with the friendliness of the registration clerks at both check in and check out. Hotel was very clean and had all the amenities with a very reasonable price. I would recommend this hotel to all."
"1255",3,"To be fair I went into this hotel with high expectations based off of multiple stays at the Redbury in LA. Its my go to in LA because of how amazing it is - it is my third or fourth hotel in the US hands down. The Redbury NYC doesnt compare. The hotel itself a little unkempt. Not in a trendy vintage way but in a needs some TLC way. We stayed in a deluxe double, the beds are really small, view was bleh, and there was a lot of construction across the street so it was noisy on our side early in the morning (not the fault of the hotel obviously) I can handle all the above and it wouldnt have been an issue however the service is what was so disappointing to me. The bellhop (if you can call him that) was rude and mumbled things under his breath after I asked for help to get luggage to the room. Note: I had to ask - when I was clearly walking in with two daughters and luggage. We called to the front to ask for cutlery, they said they would check and see if they had any and bring it up twenty minutes later my husband had to go and get it. We never heard from them. No one was overly friendly with the exception of two staff one being the housekeeper who was cleaning the rooms on the 6th floor when we checked in. She had great energy and went out of her way to ask what we needed and if she could help in any way. And the second was a gentleman who answered the concierge call when we had a few questions about parking. Outside of that this hotel really needs to step up there customer service game. See also my review of Marta. Same theme, very flat, non- engaging staff. Delicious pizza though. So its almost like you have a great product but your front line isnt selling it. Overall average which is disappointing for this brand. Thank you for sharing your feedback, Domenica.We regret that your experience with us was less than ideal. We're disappointed to hear the service you received wasn't up to par. Providing our guests with exceptional service is something we take seriously. Please know this will be addressed with the appropriate members of our team so we may improve for the future.We hope you'll give us another chance to show you the service we're truly capable of providing."
"1256",3,"Bad: Room was really expensive for what it was Location was bad - takes up to 45 mins to get into Hollywood. Good: Bed was comfortable Place was clean"
"1257",5,"Just got back from an amazing weekend at the St. Regis. We used our starpoints to reserve a night at the St. Regis in celebration of our anniversary. I had high hopes for a Category 7 hotel - and St. Regis did not disappoint! We'd had a bit of a rough journey, but from the moment Pascal took our bags to Jose at the front desk checking us in, Ildna showing me to the fitness room where I could have a little workout before our room was ready - everyone took such great care of us. We will definitely be back!Dear Traveller94115, We are very pleased to learn that Pascal, Jose and Ilona all provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York. Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. We look forward to sharing your review with the team, and we hope that we will have the opportunity of having you as our guest very soon!Warmest Regards,The St. Regis Management Team"
"1258",5,"For a super affordable price you will get an impeccably clean room, gracious and friendly check-in and assistance, and old-time amenities that include a fire pit, picnic tables and horseshoe pits! There is also a mini dog-park and they are very pet friendly. It is conveniently located only a mile south of Florence on 101, and nearly directly across the... More"
"1259",4,"I stayed here the night before leaving on a flight from Logan. It's a cute place with a nautical theme,great seaport location. Very clean, and nice rooms with high ceilings. The Black Rose Irish Pub across the street was great as well."
"1260",1,"Horrible service. Run down. Over-priced. Even the shower curtain was the wrong width (too narrow) for the shower. Sink clogged. Stains on furniture. Just gross. We stayed there only because our wedding reception was next door. Never again. So very disappointed. Don't let the lobby fool you. The only positive thing is the location."
"1261",4,"What's really unpleasing is that the hotel has no windows that can be opened and the air conditioning system has old filters, as much as I can say. There's a 'smell' of old air throughout the hotel and in the room (I was), which could only be explained with less than efficient functioning of the a/c system."
"1262",4,"everything was fine until my check out. i had the comeback at home with out money for a error on the front desk staff ..they block my credit card .after many charges.. and i had the pay on cash my last cash to return at home for they mistake and they didn't even apologize..front desk supervisor was totally rude..tours me...

"1263",5,"Needed a place in the Summerlin area for a visit with relatives. The room was clean and spacious (we were also upgraded to a suite at the last minute). Views of the strip or mountains, or both if you get a suite. Well located for west Vegas activities. Good restaurants at the hotel and nearby. Will definitely stay there again."
"1264",5,"Awesome place to stay. Staff was friendly and helpful. The room was excellent, plenty of space and well designed and decorated. All the features you could ask for. It's in a great location in the center of town and very close to the pier, restaurants and bars. Pismo Brewing Company right across the street. If you are looking for a... More"
"1265",3,"Overall our stay was ok, Staff was not helpful when checking in. One attendant said she will help you in a minute after she gets off phone. Then after she was off and I stood there for few minutes she said can i help you. I said we are checking in, She said that the other attendant will help me!! Finally checked in, Room was ok, Nothing spectacular although the mirror was so clean my wife thought there was another room. lol Biggest downfall was that there seemed to be a lot of coming and going late at night/early morning. Hotel is right behind a questionable restaraunt. We did not have any issues though, just a feeling of concern,"
"1266",5,"Bad: The omelets were watery and tasted odd and the pool was small. Good: Location was excellent. Within walking distance to the Convention Center and Inner Harbor"
"1267",5,"After driving 14 hours, starting out in 60 mph+ winds, finding out interstate was closed due to a rock slide it was time to stop. Front desk staff greeted us with a smile and said they had a room ready. We had just called about a hour before. Told us we where in time for the chefs dinner and we... More"
"1268",4,"Bad: One lonely and confused roach in the bathroom. Breakfast, but since we're Europeans this may be a matter of taste. Good: Spacious, comfortable rooms with air conditioning and dehumidifiers too. Nice reception area with a 24hrs possibility to buy toiletries, snacks, etc. Very close to the Disney parks and just next to a great Asian restaurant."
"1269",5,"Good: Great value, excellent customer service"
"1270",5,"I have stayed at this facility, once or twice a year, going on some 30 years now. I travel by motorcycle - rain, shine, cold, and warm. The personnel I have interacted with are always first rate, helpful, and friendly. The facilities are clean, dry, and in my opinion, complete with everything I have wanted/needed/expected. The takeout facilities Sunset Motel... More"
"1271",3,"A little shabby but you get what you pay for. Upside was the beach being right behind the motel.They did have nightly events such as movie night, live DJ. Also the view from the balcony was beautiful! They have a pretty nice pool also."
"1272",5,"Bad: It's not a negative per se but, breakfast could be more widely selective. But what was there was absolutely fantastic. Good: We were super-well accommodated, the staff was super-friendly and helpful. Location is great, and even on a loud street you couldn't here a thing."
"1273",5,"We had a very positive experience at this hotel. Our party (2 adults, 2 teenagers) had plenty of room to spread out. We had a pull-out sofa sleeper, roll-away bed, kitchenette, and queen-sz. bed. There was a large dressing area off the bathroom, a great place for suitcases, etc. The furniture was contemporary and new, beds were very comfortable. This hotel is very close to Arlington Cemetery, and the Rosslyn Metro stop was a five minute walk away. They also have a shuttle to the metro. The people at the desk were very responsive to all our needs."
"1274",5,"Love the OMNI for many reasons, the only thing that is a huge disappointment each visit is the cigarette smoking being done in the outdoor areas that we are supposed to be able to enjoy fresh air (the pool, balconies, front door entrance). Rules need to be enforced, rude guests get mad if approached about taking smoking to appropriate areas."
"1275",4,"Bad: Thermostat was hard to manage. Dining area was ok. Lots of outside options though so that was just a small thing. Good: Location and quality of room"
"1276",5,"Bad: The water wasn't super hot the first day (maybe it was time of day) and there was no way to adjust the temperature of the room. Good: The staff were super friendly and helpful. The rooms were quaint but classy. Loved the balcony. The in-room wine selection was pretty neat. I'll definitely come back to experience more of what they have to offer."
"1277",1,"I was so disgusted and disappointed with my stay here. The room was dirty and dusty (cobwebs, grime along floor boards, bugs in windowsill), the shower was FILTHY, the entire room was EXTREMELY outdated (carpet all over the walls - floor to ceiling), an accordian door on the bathroom, the sink was loose on the wall, dirt/mildew ring in the... More"
"1278",4,"This hotel is a Club Quarters hotel, which means that it is geared towards business travelers. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate since we weren't in Chicago to spend time in our hotel room. The hotel reminded me of a European hotel, especially since it's in an old building. The location is perfect right across the street from the River, near Michigan Ave. between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. The hotel restaurant is surprisingly good, and makes the famous Chicago deep dish pizza. The couple at the table next to us were staying at the Fairmont and their concierge recommended it."
"1279",5,"Virtually the only place for any regular live music and good entertainment in town or to have interesting, intelligent conversation with the awesome staff. A very lively and intimate bar."
"1280",5,"We came for a weekend getaway with friends and our third time at the Aria. We have tried other properties and just feel the Aria is the best-- perfect location, incredible restaurants, wonderful pool and fitness areas... And don't forget the smell when you enter the lobby-- I'm pretty convinced that's what Heaven smells like!"
"1281",5,"Found ourselves in a bind after another hotel refused to honor our gift card. Employee that answered the phone and later checked us in was extremely helpful and welcoming and processed the Choice Hotels gift card without an issue. Room was very modern yet comfortable. Furnishings were quite pretty. No noise at all from the hall or other rooms. Breakfast... More"
"1282",5,"All was wonderful, courteous staff, good choice of breakfast items, clean and quiet. Was surprised that the room thermostat would not respond to my setting, it was programmed to a pre-set temp which was a little too warm for my liking."
"1283",4,"Really friendly staff. Room was very clean and comfortable. Only slightly negative thing to add, I had to wake up the sleeping overnite front desk personel when I was checking out in the morning!"
"1284",5,"This was a nice clean, quiet facility with a larger room that I expected. We will come back and stay here again. The location was very handy for Opry Mills shopping without the expense of some other facilities."
"1285",4,"Good: Location."
"1286",4,"not luxury, but not dirty and a place to rest head. Can't complain, great price for a room."
"1287",4,"We enjoyed this hotel a lot. We have had the Jacuzzi suite twice a regular room once. They are very clean and the price was right.They have a very nice continental breakfast, was very good. We will be back again!!"
"1288",3,"The hotel stay was great. Stayed for a conference located at the hotel which was great as well. The only complaint I have is the parking. You can park in their parking garage connected to the hotel for a $16 charge, which is a little ridiculous. The hotel was good at compensating me for this as I was uninformed and unaware, but the third party company that rubs the toll through the garage was absolutely horrid!!! I was I could give negative reviews on them alone they one young lady in particular made my great weekend end in absolute anger while leaving. Tried to charge me almost $40 in charges for parking with the receipt from the hotel, staying that they had covered it for me."
"1289",1,"Worst place ever for family room was smelly and office staff not helpful"
"1290",3,"Bad: We parked our car in the hotel parking and the second day we realized that somebody had broken in. Somehow we didn't find Las Vegas a safe place to travel. Solely for leisure, I will not return to US again. Not value for money. Good: It was one of the cheapest places we found in Las Vegas during those days."
"1291",3,"Bad: The bed was so uncomfortable that I am still soar tired a day from being home. The curtain would not close completely to block out pole light."
"1292",5,"Since I rarely have or take the time to reply to emails asking me to rate a particular hotel, item or service me seeking out your website to make my comments is telling in itself. My wife and I stayed in the Pentagon City location from 7/4/2013 to 7/7/2013. It was, in our opinion, the best hotel stay for us, ever. Every single member of the staff that we encountered from the moment that we pulled our vehicle into the check in area on 7/4 until our trunk was packed on 7/7 was friendly, professional and helpful. It was our pleasure to enjoy dinner in your restaurant on 7/4 and breakfast the remaining three days. Each meal was excellent. I would specifically like to mention Bryan Haley who took the time on the evening of 7/4 to chat with us at our dinner table. What is amazing to me is that Bryan and most of the other staff seemed to remember us and all of the other guests. Please thank your staff for a memorable stay. I would hope to stay at your hotel the next time we have the opportunity to be in the Washington, D.C. Area."
"1293",5,"Bad: Need something horizontal in bathroom. . Good: Great accommodations, central location, great food."
"1294",5,"My friend and I stayed at Orange City Motel while vacationing in Florida. Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful, especially with giving us directions to various attractions. The room was clean and comfortable. Blue Springs State Park is about fifteen minutes away and the main highway is also close. I recomend this hotel."
"1295",5,"Excelente, lo recomiendo al 100 y esta muy cerca del aeropuerto"
"1296",4,"Nice room. they offered us a price on events we told them yes we would take that offer and then they was told we could not do it"
"1297",3,"This motel has been updated to some extent, the floors squick badly, the shower needs a lot of TLC, the walls must be very thin, as you can hear the TV next door. On the bright side, the beds are comfortable, the room is clean, and all the rooms on the main floor have a private patio. I has a... More"
"1298",4,"Stayed two nights, was greeted by Ben who was very helpful throughout our meetings during our stay, nicest hotel staff we had on our 2 week trip. The room has been refurbished but it's lacking coffee in the room, it's available by the front desk though. Nothing against the hotel (it's next to a Hilton who would have the same issue) but there are a lot of homeless in the area although they generally didn't cause much issue. It was noted the expensive hotels seem to have walkways above the pavements to avoid the riffraff, although I didn't really like the idea of rising above everyone else to be honest. Only a 5 min walk to Marta stations and downtown areas, 10 mins to the Olympic park area."
"1299",5,"Couldn't be nicer!!! Front desk was courtesy at check in. Clean rooms no bed so comfortable. Front desk called 10 mins after check in to make sure everything was ok. Fresh and nice breakfast selection."
"1300",5,"Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service."
"1301",5,"I have spent many visits at this hotel..The staff is very friendly and helpful.. The rooms are spacious and always clean..I always feel welcome there.. I am greeted like a friend.. All remember me, even housekeeping..The breakfast is always hot and ready for anyone .. there is always someone at the front desk for your every need..I will return anytime... More"
"1302",2,"Only staff that was friendly was the evening desk person. The Red Lion Inn Suites Manager McMinnville, OR is very VERY rude! Crystal!! We attempted to cancel our second night due to changes in our travel plans. A few hours after we checked in we were told checking out a day early was no problem so we made a reservation at another hotel a few hours further south in OR. When we went to check out we were told by Crystal that we would not be getting a refund for the second night because we were a pre-pay. She insisted that it was Expedia that would not permit the refund. She also said it was hotel policy that since it was a prepay the second night could not be refunded!! I called Expedia, and they tried to get the Crystal to release us from the second night and they were told NO, and Expedia had no choice but to honor the hotel policy. So now we had two hotel reservations. Fortunately Expedia was able to cancel the reservation we had made at the other hotel (without penalty). We later checked the hotel policy on-line and it did not say anything regarding no refund for cancelling a second night, only first night or no shows!! We brought this to Crystals attention, and she just said hmmm, Ill check into that. No apologies, no managerial flexibility in resolving our customer dissatisfaction, and she talked to us as if we were children. Red Lion did not care about our needs, only about selling out the hotel!! We doubt we will never stay at another Red Lion."
"1303",5,"This is a good one, guys! Rooms are convenient and comfortable, with self check-in and number-pad doors that miraculously work. It's small (I think 5 rooms) and walkable to anywhere in Hilo. We stayed in the smallest (read: cheapest) room no. 2. Had everything we needed, even a little kitchenette. It got maybe a bit noisy with the street but... More"
"1304",5,"Very impressed with the customer service at this Hampton Inn - Patrick, the manager, was incredibly helpful in coordinating my travel through Chapel Hill. The receptionist, Sean, was incredibly kind and welcoming especially after a long day of travel. The room was in great condition and very clean. Hot breakfast and free wifi were great bonuses. Would book here again... More"
"1305",5,"It was pleasantly wonderful!!! I would stay there all the time..."
"1306",1,"I could not stay because the room that was given to my family and I was dirty and with a bad smell. The sheets had yellow dirty spots and to add to all this, the air conditioner did not work. The hotel did not want to give my money back, but when I called Hotel.com they took care of everything to me. I've got my refund."
"1307",4,"I would give it an excellent rating only the villas are slightly dated and worn (but very clean.) But, aside from that, it's perfect. Fireplaces, views, full kitchen, walk to the creek, walk to uptown, clean and beautiful spa area with great attention to details. The staff is helpful and polite."
"1308",5,"For the rate it was an amazing stay! Would definitely recommend to my friends!"
"1309",5,"Bad: The prices of the SPA treatment are quite expensive. If you go to most expensive SPA in Dubai the treatment can varies between USD 120 for normal facial cleansing up to USD 500 or 600 for a full package of 4 hours . Yet here the minimum starts at USD 280/- excluding the taxes ! . Good: What not to like about this property !!! Everything was great. The location, the spacious rooms the view the room service the in room dining the restaurants even the Spa. Ok I didn't try the spa due to my busy schedule but it looked so good (although the prices of the treatments were quite expensive). Some people thing that the hotel is a bit expensive, well it is located in one of the most prestigious and expensive districts in LA. It is just located on the famous Rodeo Drive. The rooms were big. I advise you to not take the room with balconies if you know your self won't use it. The balcony takes space out of the room. My most concerns and worries normally in any hotel is the cleanness of the bathroom and toilets and here it was just perfect."
"1310",5,"We had a great stay at The Foundre while in town for a concert. Everything about this hotel was hip right down to the buttons in the elevators. The art was awesome...the Burt Reynolds painting still continues to make me laugh. Be sure to check out the artwork of Phoenix made out of recycled security envelopes and checks...so cool! The room had an industrial-style and were uber-clean. Beds were comfy. Located right next to the lightrail it is an easy ride to the center of downtown Phoenix. Oh and the staff was friendly and helpful!Wow! Thank you so much for this awesome review! We're so happy to hear you had a great stay and loved the hotel. Hope you will visit again soon."
"1311",4,"Great location across the street from lake Union. Hotel and rooms have been updated, also has a bistro, convenient for meals. Tons of great restaurants in walking distance. Staff here has always been great. I'm actually here as I write this review and and have stayed here a handful of times over the past few years. Also has a below... More"
"1312",2,"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas."
"1313",5,"What a beautiful Hampton Inn in Napa. Great Location within walking distance of a movie theatre, gym, a few restaurants and Starbucks. The rooms are a nice size. The beds were comfy. They had DirecTv which is always a huge Plus! But the bathroom was awesome. Love, love, love the extra lighting and shelving for us ladies. The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has. Even with all the amazing light it was hard to get up close to the mirror to do my makeup because of the size of the nice vanity."
"1314",4,"The room was ok. It took 10 minutes for me to check in with no wait. The young lady at desk was apparently occupied in back office. Had to call front desk just so she would come up front. Noticed in my room there was a rag hanging on the shower that had been used and the trash can had trash in it. Went to complain and of course no one was at front desk. Didn't stay the night. Lesson learned"
"1315",3,"Located one block from the beach and Haystack Rock, this is probably the best location for the price in Cannon Beach. We had a Studio room on the ground floor. It was simply a room with a queen size bed, a tV, apartment size fridge, free wifi, and bath. The owners seem very paranoid about being ripped off by guests.... More"
"1316",5,"a hidden jewel. extremely nice, comfy, friendly staff and very clean. not what you would expect when you walk inside. Most definitely staying here again next time i am in okc. the rooftop bar was extremely fun-great drinks, food and atmosphere. walking distance to great restaraunts and not far from brick town, okc memorial."
"1317",5,"Great stay!"
"1318",5,"Bad: View. We had a view of an alley. But, that's the only downside. Good: Staff was extremely helpful. Rooms were well-appointed, clean and functional."
"1319",3,"My family of 4 stayed for 1 night for our 1 day trip to Six Flags. It was our first time staying at this motel, we usually stay elsewhere but many of the hotels were booked because of New Years Eve. I figured I'd give this one a try since it mentioned it was recently remodeled. First the location. This... More"
"1320",3,"The hotel is OK, decent bed but very old decor and cheap, can not find place to put bath amenities, there is one small sink which has no space. The housekeeping does not change sheet everyday, she cut herself and left all her bloody on the sheet and comforter, so terrible. Overall the room looks cheap....Would not go back."
"1321",5,"I came down for a work event, and I chose this hotel mainly for its proximity to the event site, but I ended up having dinner at the restaurant on the 11th floor, which offered great happy hour and fantastic views. It was convenient having those options on-site, as I had driven far to get there, and didn't want to have to get back in the car to find a place to eat. My only complaint is that the hotel is valet-only, which results in unexpected expenses because I felt obligated to tip the valet drivers each time, but that's not a huge deal."
"1322",3,"Location was great for sightseeing. Neighborhood very poor where hotel located. Rooms were comfortable and clean....only issue bathroom was small. Exercise room needs some updating though. Breakfast was adequate."
"1323",4,"Excellent value for the money. Great place to stay if you are skiing or biking in the Burke area. The room was less than half the cost of larger hotels and inns. The rooms are older and very simple, but clean and well kept. The staff was very friendly as well."
"1324",4,"Proximity to waterfront and downtown Seattle. Room was comfortable and service was good. You can walk to Space needle from this location. Ask for a waterfront facing room. Standard breakfast and internet."
"1325",4,"A very nice Hotel with very friendly staff. The complimentary breakfast was ok but nothing great. The only problem we ran into was the indoor pool was being worked on so it was closed to us."
"1326",4,"Registered for a two nights. Clerk got confused and scheduled one night. I had to leave a business meeting to schedule another night stay. Re-checked in when I returned."
"1327",5,"We enjoy the stay, we can visit all museums but for next time"
"1328",5,"Very friendly, great location in the French Quarter very comfortable. It was just down the sidewalk from Bourbon street but far enough to get away from the late night partying. I give it a 5 star rating."
"1329",5,"Nice room but horrible Internet. The breakfast was good as was the happy hour."
"1330",4,"Stayed at the Best Western Plus in Glenview overnight with a friend. She had a business meeting late that morning not far from the motel. We had time to eat the breakfast which was great as was the coffee. Usual fare of waffles, yogurt, and fruit. I must say that the scrambled eggs tasted homemade. The Canadian bacon was dry.... More"
"1331",5,"My wife and I stayed here for the first three nights of our honeymoon and had a great time. The hotel has a lot of character and history which we felt made the experience that much more unique. And the lobby bar was magical."
"1332",5,"Very nice place to stay. Clean...safe...wifi was fast...staff very friendly. Would stay again for sure"
"1333",1,"I was lead to believe through your site that pets were welcome and no extra fee was charged, then when I got there they told me I had to pay x-amount a day but since the only person staying the next night was my grandmother and I would be leaving with my cat that was all I would be charged but then I was charged 2x more and they said there was nothing they could do about this. I even confronted the same person and asked why I was paying 2x more and that this was not what you told me the day before, he said he was sorry, but I was to pay 2x more. I will never go to Days Inn again, x amount a day is ridiculous."
"1334",5,"Bad: There was nothing I didn't like! It was the best!. Good: EVERYTHING! The staff was amazing and friendly, very courteous, always made sure you were ok and comfortable. They gave suggestions on things to do and places to go...simply amazing! The hotel smelled amazing, it's the first thing you notice walking in! It's very clean and nice. You get beach towels, a chair and umbrella. The beach is literally a block away, and you're also located a block from all of the action of South Beach. The hotel is located in a quieter area, so it's great to wind down after a long day. This hotel was one of the highlights of our trip! We will always stay here for our trips to Miami, I'm so happy we chose this hotel!"
"1335",5,"This location is as good or better than the average Hampton Inn. Food is great. Room is great but doesn't have a fridge. The only negative is if you have a large vehicle due to the (free) parking garage on the property."
"1336",1,"Room had a bad smell and shower did not work. Room was not clean. It had a drity bathroom. Spoke to front desk and they did nothing. Call customer service did help by giving a free night stay. Rooms do not look like the pictures."
"1337",4,"Bad: The ventilation system was not adequate for the building. Everything including room smelled like cigarette smoke. Good: restaurant"
"1338",5,"Good: Surprisingly quiet!"
"1339",5,"This hotel was really great! I had read many reviews of hotels in the area before booking, and this one was a winner in most categories and I can see why! The room was excellent, very clean, very modern, very nice. The only reason I went down on the comfort was that I found the bed to be a little hard for my liking, but I have back issues, so that could be why. The staff was amazing. I ended up becoming very ill, and they were very accommodating and empathetic, and that was greatly appreciated. The breakfast was excellent, a good spread with many options. The pool and hot tub were nice, especially in the evening. The location is directly on the beach, and the balconies allow for a fantastic view (even when you are lying ill on the couch!). I would most definitely stay here again, and it was an excellent price, making it that much better!"
"1340",4,"Located right in the heart of historic Lahaina, you can't get a more convenient hotel for the price. It's a lovely historic hotel, very clean and well cared for. Yes, it's an older building and room sizes reflect the age (smaller - but they do the trick!). Yes, some of the fixtures are a little worn in, and there is... More"
"1341",5,"Very nice! Accesability of bathroom was well thought out. As a handicapped person I can ALWAYS tell when the design of a space was done by a non handicapped person."
"1342",4,"Nice enough hotel. Nice breakfast setup each morning. Room was clean but items were never replaced each day, had to call for replacement. Good location off of 192. Employees treated you well when interacted with."
"1343",4,"We loved this midcentury hotel. The staff was very nice and they have some rooms that alow pets. The hotel has a small restaurant and bar with hand crafted cocktails and excellent food and a nice but limited wine list"
"1344",5,"The hotel was very comfortable. I was there for one night, and chose it for the location. The staff was very nice and welcoming, the bed was super-comfortable, and I melted right into it. I awoke fresh, had a great breakfast in the lobby, and took the shuttle to the airport. Of course, the shuttle left precisely on time, as... More"
"1345",5,"Bad: Bed wasn't awful but could have been better. Parking is a couple blocks away in a garage (I would consider this neutral - pretty much standard for Miami Beach). Good: Quaint with an art deco feel. I will definitely be back!"
"1346",5,"Loved this hotel. Great rooms and staff. Pool area is nice and it's available for use at anytime.the one time it rained our family went into the lounge area and the staff was ok with it. So much to do within walking distance. Great location."
"1347",2,"This is a nice location, close to good local food and excellent snorkeling with nice beaches close by. The host is kind and prepares a nice breakfast.

The water quality and supply was great. Thanks for a comfortable... More"
"1349",5,"We took a 3 week driving tour of the West and national parks. I wish they had a Sunshine Inn in every town. That said, this place is not for everyone since it's not hip or updated. It's just cheap, clean, and the bed was the most comfortable of the trip. We saved 100 here over what we had to... More"
"1350",4,"This hotel is very quaint, with its large foyer with huge open fire and, indoor heated pool and large rooms. Breakfast every morning in the dinning room was traditional US. Value for money absolutely."
"1351",1,"I travel constantly and stay at hotels nearly every night and I can say that this place is no place for any human being the blankets are unwashed and the Bathroom is disgusting, everything stinks and is amazingly filthy. After a full day of flying cross country and driving 200 miles I was too exhausted to leave... An there is... More"
"1352",4,"I like this place, even though it is a 30-minute commute to my work location, but the shuttle to Metro is convenient. This time one of the elevators was out of service with a note that it would be fixed the Monday of my arrival, but it was still out of commission when I left. The only drawback is the breakfast. One day, they added some sausage patties to the steamer table and it was actually cold--not even room temperature. It should have been heated first, because it appeared to be leftover from another day (and not just 1 day ago because the day before they had links, not patties). The last day, there wasn't even really meat. They had eggs, potatoes and grits along with corned beef hash, which is more of a potato entree--not a meat entree. For someone like myself, who doesn't eat potatoes, there was essentially no meat. Hopefully in the future, there will be plain meat--either bacon or sausage. I would not hesitate to come back here in the future."
"1353",4,"Bad: Nothing to not like. All good. Good: The location was good as it was close to restaurants and the harbour. It was also very close to Whole Food supermarket so very handy for a family."
"1354",4,"Bad: Not a thing. Good: The room was nice and clean, bed was very comfy. The restaurants were all great the Buffet was awesome.......... So much to do in the aera"
"1355",4,"Reason for stay was to catch flight early am. Location is excellent to airport. Shuttle service efficient, although was somewhat crowded leaving. Return was very good. Also, hotel is close to restaurant I love to visit. Overall very good experience!"
"1356",5,"We chose the Blue Harbor because it's a half way point for our family to come together, and so the trip commenced with 3 families piling into a 4 bedroom (unit 730) villa. With 11 people you would think it would be crowded...but not even close. From a fully stocked kitchen with everything you needed to cook large meals, to... More"
"1357",5,"We found the room very clean, the hotel staff was friendly, the breakfast in the restaurant was excellent. The hotel is in a great location and we were able to walk to many of the tourist attractions. The only thing I'd do different next time is self-park. We used the valet parking, which was wonderful, but we didn't need the car during our stay because everything was so close. We could have saved some money by using the parking deck located behind the hotel."
"1358",5,"We stay here whenever visiting Boise. Good rooms, nice evening reception with two free drinks (with snacks) and great breakfast included with room. They even let us leave our car here for three weeks to save on parking at airport. There is a movie theater across the road and some good restraints available in the neighborhood."
"1359",5,"I love the Best Western Plus product. The rooms are always big and clean.This is my first visit to Napa, the area is beautiful. I picked this locating using my airline discount site which posted good reviews as well.The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We received a 3rd floor room above the lobby which afforded us a great view. Even though our balcony overlooked the road, we never heard any traffic noises. There is plenty of shopping and food options right across the street.We drove to downtown Napa and found plenty of great option for shopping and dining as well. I recommend going down there for good local flavor. I would discourage using your phone as your GPS to get around to various vineyards, we had two different maps going but kept losing our signal. Either bring your Garmen, etc. or ask the rental car agency for one just in case.Thank you for your detailed review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay."
"1360",3,"The Hyatt Valencia, located near Magic Mountain in non-descript Santa Clarita is a dressed up basic hotel.

Bob was a good host taking care of guests as they arrived and looking after others in the lounge. I... More"
"1364",5,"Nice place convenient to airport before or after a flight. Airport shuttle between airport and hotel. Parking available short and long term. Comfortable room with sofa and work desk. Good burger place just across the parking lot."
"1365",5,"This motel was a good surprise. Our room was very clean, and still smelled of bleach. The floor is hardwood, not carpet. I guess it's because of the pets allowed it's also easier to clean. Overall, this motel is an excellent option in Escalante, and don't miss the attached restaurant (Circle D eatery), which is very good."
"1366",1,"Toilet paper is like sandpaper. Billed for charges that even the staff can not explain and having to make numerous repeat calls to get corrected. A week later and STILL not corrected. If you stay, get your bill before you leave the property! Coffee was offered in lobby first day and then STOPPED Seems as if the restaurant is struggling and they wanted people to purchase coffee vs offer. Pitiful. One of the worst hotel stays I have had, especially from a Hilton. Location is not the best eitherThank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we apologize for any issues you encountered during your stay. Your feedback is very important to us and so please contact me directly to discuss further so that I can address accordingly.Regards,"
"1367",3,"As Christian I found this hotel inappropriate because of what I think were sexually suggestive photos and art work. I would not recommend this hotel for families with children because of the photos and Artwork. Hi Delia, our intention is never to offend anyone. One of our values is community and in that we are inclusive of people of all walks of life. We curate all local art from local artists to support our local community but also to support different values and showcase different views from everyone. We certainly understand that not everyone will enjoy or understand the art, but we thank you for giving us a try. Just as any other contemporary museum, we showcase art that reflects the life and times of the artists we represent here as an art hotel. We do have families who stay here and enjoy it as a learning experience and we hope to continue to provide that for our guests and local community."

We appreciated being able to open a window for fresh air. The king room is really comfortable and convenient with sitting area. Wifi worked smoothly. Looking forward to returning."
"1382",4,"The hotel was conveniently close to everything. It's close enough to walk downtown but far enough away to be quiet. Clean rooms, friendly staff, and a decent free breakfast made the stay enjoyable. The only negative was that the room I had was a little smaller than I'm used to. Next time I'll get a bigger room."

"1429",3,"The staff were great, however the heating/cooling system and cable did not work properly. When I attempted to make a reservation, the staff could not get it right. I finally went online myself and did it. However, they were very nice upon arrival. I just felt it was way too pricey for what we got."

"1431",1,"Very horrible customer service at the beginning of our stay and during our stay, We are.very disappointed with this hotel. The walls are paper thin. The customer service rep hung up on me as I was describing how loud the guest was next door."
"1432",2,"The staff was very friendly and nice, the bed was comfortable, but there were ants on the walls, in the bathroom - we kept our suitcases zipped to make sure we didn't take any with us! Fortunately the bed was clean and ant-free. The room was clean - they just had a problem with ants which should have been taken care of. The front desk guy, a very friendly young man, did tell s when we left that the were doing complete renovations in the next few months, so this problem might soon be solved."
"1433",5,"Bad: There wasn't anything I didn't like. Good: All staff was very nice and extremely accommodating. The entire property was clean and well kept. The room was clean when we arrived and housekeeping came every morning to clean and verify all was well and if we needed any additional towels, toiletries etc. Their breakfast area was clean, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty food to go around. I read some guests didn't like the breakfast voucher system but my husband and I liked them because we have stayed at other hotels where there is more people in the breakfast area than there is food. Their Wifi went down while at their business center, they informed me that the system was running slow and that their service provider was on property trying to fix it. I let them know that I was in the middle of a Disney ticket purchase and the front desk staff immediately got their own personal Hotspot set up on their front desk computer. They let me finish my Disney ticket purchase/transaction from their desk....yes from their desk... which i didn't expect. I was really happy cause that saved us alot of time and hassle. The hotel is close to WDW and plenty of dinning. It was overall a wonderful stay, nothing to complain about...other that they could accommodate me the extra day we decide to stay, but that was our fault since we did it last minute. Would HIGHLY recommend."
"1434",4,"Bad: no need Karaoke club. Good: Clean and comfortable facilities"
"1435",2,"This location was little more than a hotel 6 at 4 times the cost. Very disappointed with the accommodations. I choose Best Western as they have always been a great hotel...not this time. There seemed to be a bit of attitude because this is the wine country There are a lot of choice...choose wisely."
"1436",3,"Nice large rooms, but our A/C did not work well, especially in the bedroom. This was a higher priced King Corner Suite. Only stayed for 1 night, so told front desk staff on the way out. Happy hour is a nice idea, but no way to get near the small and understaffed bar to get a drink. Could not check in at 1:00, had to wait until 3 pm, which is the rule, but would have been nice to find a room earlier. Breakfast was very good."

I was first assigned Room 421 which after spending some time there realised that the main lights were not working and the toilet appeared to be clogged - also found a sweetener paper wrap in the toilet.

"1450",2,"Not the most restful hotel in the world. The air-freshener made a bleeping noise every 82 seconds and the front desk didn't even try to fix it, preferring to let it bleep through the night.

Classic basic terrazzo floors in the lobby that you'll find after you locate the dark street entrance to the back parking lot off of Eads.

"1454",5,"I stay often for work, maybe once every other month every time I have stayed the staff is always so nice and the whole hotel and room is very clean. During the holidays they had their lobby decorated really nice and it felt very inviting. They also have a nice breakfast in the morning which is a nice when you... More"
"1455",2,"Very disappointed in my visit! There was no iron or ironing board so I went wrinkled. They false advertised free breakfast in morning because they just switched from Days inn to home stay so they didn't have license to serve food yet. I will not be back"

"1457",5,"My son got accepted to Stanford University so we went to the admit weekend!. This location is a bit far from the school, besides paying 5usd for toll, and the rush hour traffic, it was pretty good, and the sites on the way made it worth it!"
"1458",3,"Hotel was very clean and room was ready upon arrival."
"1459",4,"Bad: Need to invest in better pillows and linens. Good: Spot on location! Wonderfully decorated, oversized rooms!"
"1460",5,"This was our first time staying at a LaQuinta and it won't be our last. We travel across the United States twice a year from Florida to BC, Canada and we will be staying at LaQuinta more. They are pet friendly, have nice clean rooms, the staff is wonderful and the breakfast is Great."
"1461",5,"Staying at this hotel just made sense for us. My husband had to travel to CA and I had to stay in GA but about 45 mins away from the airport and we were very tired. It was so convenient for us to check into this hotel late evening, enjoy the ambiance and comfort of the hotel, get some rest,... More"

"1463",3,"This hotel has a SERIOUS need to update their beds....worst/loudest bed I have ever slept in!"
"1464",5,"The hotel was new and fresh and loved the fact the old, city, utilities building was repurposed and refreshed. The staff was friendly and everyone helpful. The location was far enough away from the French Quarter to be quiet but still within a 10 minute walk. Class Act all the way!It's great to hear from you and I'm glad you had a fantastic stay at our hotel. Your comments to location and staff are gratefully received and we hope to welcome you back soon.Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"1465",5,"We have found that Drury Hotels are usually very clean and updated. This hotel was very nice. Staff was friendly and professional. Generous with bath towels which is appreciated. Excellent breakfast. Free newspaper a bonus."
"1466",5,"Los cuartos muy limpios la limpieza en la alberca eso me gusto mucho todos los dias la limpian y le dedican tiempo a q quede todo bien eso se aprecia"
"1467",5,"Elsah is charming. The inn is a very short walk from the river and a view of the bluffs. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. The inn keeper gave us coupons for wine at the Grafton Winery and Restaurant where we enjoyed the sunset over the Mississippi. Breakfast was wonderful. I wish we could have stayed another night!"
"1468",4,"This Club Quarters is my first visit to this Hotel chain and overall I had a great experience.

"1470",2,"I want to emphasize that the problems I describe here were dealt with by the overworked night staff (desk manager and shuttle bus driver/handyman who went out of their way to solve the problem of our room. I have stayed in this hotel over the years but this was worst experience and perhaps the last time. It looks as if management has cut staffing to the bone. At hotel desk I waited for nearly 20 minutes. The clerk was with a guest of the hotel who had a problem. The guest explained the problem at least five times the clerk kept forgetting details -- because he never wrote anything down -- instead repunching the same mistakes into the computer over and over again. No one else came out to help and he kept repeating mistakes. The guest, a businessman, was very patient and stepped aside to let me check-in. The clerk finally got to me. We loaded up a baggage cart and went up to the sixth floor. We found a nice room at well over 100 degrees. It is seemed as if policy is to completely turn off air conditioning between guests. Downstairs lobby was cool and pleasant. Upper level lobbies and room were very hot. Room faced afternoon sun directly unshaded. We set the AC on cool hoped for the best. I went downstairs to use the business center which is a computer in an open area with children playing on it. A child got up but no obvious reset function for privacy and screen faced a group of children hanging out. Hotel also needs to reduce loitering in parking lot."
"1471",5,"I went to the Pine Barn for a baby shower and it was beautifully decorated, quiet and wonderful service. So wonderful to have a historic Inn in our area!"
"1472",4,"The hotel offered all the amenities for a great experience. Every detail was met. We arrived late and left early so we were unable to do much but noted all of them. The shower head (several options) and temp of the water was great for our much appreciated arrival was awesome!"
"1473",3,"Front hallway light was out when we first walked into our room. Super tiny bathroom but that was expected for the price. Only half the floor was carpeted and the remaining was super cold and hard on the feet. I had my house slippers but my husband had forgotten his. Great location in Rockford if you just need an inexpensive but convenient room for the night."

This place is right out of Good Fellas - great ambiance, and old school vibe with great food. We've never stayed here, but always enjoy gambling here and coming for an occasional drink, or to watch a movie at the theater."
"1476",5,"What a pleasant surprise! The cottages were neat and clean and perfect for our family of 5. We were toasty warm even when the temps dipped to -28 (-43 with the windchill) at night.

"1480",2,"While nice looking on the outside and in the lobby the rooms leave much to be desired! Upon checking in we spent the next 15 minutes chasing and squishing black bugs around the floor. The mattress is very old and worn down, quite lumpy with the edges collapsing."
"1481",4,"Bad: Shower didn't drain propery, was puddle in shower when we checked in. Someone else's shower water left over, very gross. Good: Very friendly staff."
"1482",4,"Hotels can be pricey in Napa especially at peak times. I was coming to BottleRock, America 's newest music festival and didn't want to drive home nightly. I booked this motel right away because I knew there would be a big demand for local accommodations. The Best Western is located at the edge of town. It is a healthy walk to town. For BottleRock a shuttle picked up guests right out front and carried them back after the show. The hotel rooms are clean and spacious with the amenities you would need, including a small refrigerator and microwave. The hotel has a pool and a Denny's is hooked to the building. The hotel gave out a coupon for breakfast at Denny's. The desk staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. This is a decent place to stay. Prices fluctuate so you have to check aroundThank you for your review and hope to see you before next years Bottle Rock!"
"1483",4,"Good: Have been there four or five times so I think that tells you all"
"1484",4,"I so loved this hotel. The breakfast was great, although it was the same thing daily. I love the separate bedroom with a door. Every minor problem we had, someone was there to correct immediately. We stayed here to attend a convention in DC."
"1485",5,"Just came back from the Littleton Inn. My fianc and I are not usually BB type, but this place looked adorable, The inn was excellent Mary was great! Quaint little New England BB at it's best. Hoping to go back in the very near future. Not enough good things to say."
"1486",4,"This room was exceptionally clean! Check in was speedy. The front desk staff was very helpful. The only downside was the free Wi Fi was very slow.

"1491",3,"This was a weekend get away for my husband's birthday. When we first arrived, the receptionist was pleasant but screwed up my information. Kept telling me that my credit card had declined I had booked through another travel company when I clearly showed her my reservation status verified that my credit card was in good standing. She then, goes get a manager who had gotten everything taken care of but didn't apologize on their end. After going through that (holding up the line because she was the only one working) she then tells us that the computer was down so she couldn't issue us room keys. We asked what were we supposed to do She said that she would send house keeping to out floor to let us in. House keeping even struggled to get in had to get another person to open the door. Finally, enter the room checked it thoroughly. Room was dusty bathroom sink was clogged when I washed my hands. Take a shower later on, and water leaked all over bathroom floor. Checked back 3 hours later for the room keys she told us the machine was still down so we had to wait an additional hour or so. Upon check out the next morning, a different young lady ask how was our stay, I explained briefly our experience. She then tried to cover up for the hotel saying Oh, it's just that the building is older and gave us a free breakfast ticket which the food was nasty Luke warm (NOT HOT). Very disappointed! Will not be staying here again."
"1492",1,"Very clean hotel but staff from the minute checked in just felt like they had better things to do with their time and really would rather be somewhere else. We would ask them questions and they either ignored us or their person conversations were more important. Will not be staying there again."
"1493",5,"Beautiful room, ocean view, fridge in room, DVD player, balcony"
"1494",5,"Surprised by the quality of this hotel-very clean well furnished rooms , professional and friendly staff-no complaints. It was very quiet and convenient. Very central location from which to visit Mt. Dora and other destinations."

"1500",5,"Our visit to Bricktown was wonderful. From the time we arrived at the hotel and throughout our visit everyone was extraordinarily welcoming. They really made us feel they were glad we were there. Location of the hotel is perfect to experience the excitement of the Riverwalk. This is definitely a place we will visit again."

"1504",4,"Hotel was clean convenient. Staff was friendly. The view from our room was nice until we looked down saw a huge, ugly retaining pond."
"1505",3,"The hotel had a convenient location, right outside of the interstate and 5 minutes from the metro station. The front desk people were okay but it seems like they are always in a hurry - from checking in, checking out or even just asking a question. The breakfast was great, it was a hot breakfast not just bagels and hotcakes. We had eggs, grits, sausages and such. The cleaning ladies were awesome! Every time we got back to the hotel after lunch, our room was already made and our towels changed. The shuttle driver, Sam, was awesome too! He made the drive to the metro very fun and was very helpful. Again, if not for the front desk people, this hotel would be great!"
"1506",5,"Bad: Kept hearing a dog crying in the night when I tried to sleep. Good: Room was accommodated well Staff was friendly and the manager I spoke with whom helped us was very helpful n patient"
"1507",4,"The hotel is very out-dated - it had the felling of going to Catskill, NY for family vacation in the 50s. I was told that it was family owned for sixty years and I am sure that not many changes have been made during that time. It's hard to say what needs to be done - it was fine for us people who still remember 60s but our children were a little bit disappointed that kitchen and other amenities were not updated. Rooms were clean, cleaning service was friendly and responsive however everything looked rugged, old and lacked any charm. Too bad because the place is located in beautiful part of Carmel Valley. On the other hand if it exists for 60 years people must find it attractive and I wish the owner(s) good luck with this place for the next 60 years."
"1508",5,"Bad: WiFi was not working sometimes. Breakfast is pretty boring. Good: Nice location and hotel itself. The staff is nice and helpful."
"1509",3,"This hotel is in an awful area, and the pictures make it look really nice, in reality the pool is tiny and next to a car park, the water was freezing, and the general customer base at breakfast was a little out of my comfort zone. It was an overnight stop for me and I arrived late and left early,... More"

"1511",5,"Excellent customer service and very easy check in process. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. The location is great for not only the convention center, but is a quick subway trip or walking distance to most of Philadelphia most famous attractions. And having the Reading Terminal Market directly across the street is a great added bonus. There are several very good dining choices very close by. The added security of having to use your room key to enter the hotel and use the elevator is a great feature. Overall, this was a great hotel stay and recommend using Home2 Suites.

Our shuttle driver, Patricia, was so friendly and funny. We really appreciated her great customer service and getting us to the venue quickly as we... More"
"1514",2,"This place is old and dated. The bed was really uncomfortable. They put a thick pad on top of the mattress I guess to make it better. Instead it just gets wadded up when you sleep. The coverlet on to of the bed was worn and pilled and you don't even want to sit on it. The room had an odd smell. The breakfast buffet was pitiful. I'm so glad we only had to spend one night here."
"1515",1,"Over priced, old, and gross. We arrived in our very small room to towels that someone with a bad cold blew their nose in. Yes, that was left for us. The front desk laughed when they saw it.

Being a single mom, I couldn't afford the hotels on the beach and I wanted one with a great pool, at a decent price. I was able to find this one at a GREAT price and it appeared to have a nice pool as well. This hotel was awesome! Friendly staff, very clean room, and the beds were very comfortable as well. I had to use room service once, and they were prompt. Free parking and WIFI as well. The kids LOVED it and said that it was really nice. We would stay again if we ever come back to the area."

"1525",3,"Clearly this is a popular hotel. One look at the lobby area, the common areas, and your room will tell you this hotel gets lots and lots of use. It looks like it needs some TLC and a face lift. Nothing is dirty, just shabby. Nothing is worn to a fray, just run down. The staff is friendly and efficient but not especially helpful. The furnishings in the room were probably highly functional when installed but now really show their age and overuse. The sofa in my room was stained in many places. The linens were gray from cleaning too many times, the bed a little lumpy from too many nights use without replacement.Not a bad hotel, just not a great hotel either.Dear GoldenBearHusker,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott.

"1526",3,"Too much construction all around Jan. 2016--the street, two hotel buildings behind and adjacent made it very noisy!! Check this before booking...Rooms large, good cleaning service, helpful staff at front desk. Street parking is difficult to find...beware of towing."

"1528",5,"We were on a family trip and had an unexpected overnight. Pulled up, walked in, were treated well, and check in was a breeze. The pool facility was nice, the room was clean and nearly brand new. The breakfast was everything you needed. The parking lot felt safe and have 0 complaints or concerns about this property."

"1531",1,"Not operational when we went by. Looks very run down and overgrown with vegetation. So if you are looking for an investment property and a challenge this property would fit the bill. Good luck to the current owners and the new owners."
"1532",3,"I stayed for one night on my way to Indiana. Let's just say that you get what you pay for. It's was an ok stay. The room was kinda small, it needed several touch ups on the furniture/bathroom fixtures, the pillows were not good for the neck, and the bathroom was tiny. The good things were that the customer service was good and it was a nice location for exploring around town."
"1533",5,"We just arrived at 11:30 pm and are wiped out as we're heading to the airport early in the morning on a last minute and urgent trip out of town.

"1536",5,"Friendly and helpful staff. GM was training and teaching staff when I arrived. Check in by Samantha was quick and painless. The room was new and comfortable. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Cheers!"
"1537",5,"It rocked. Went for a two day concert, so many fellow showmates stayed at the hotel. The pool area was transformed into a pre-game party with food and tunes. The hotel and staff were outstanding. The only drawback was that it would have been nice if the hotel shuttle operated on the weekend."

"1551",5,"I have never been disappointed by a Hampton Inn and this one maintains that track record. The staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms and most importantly bathrooms were clean and smelled nice. And the price was right. For my purposes the location was convenient, so I have no complaints."

"1556",5,"We were quite late getting to the hotel. Reception was really great. Most importantly, we were traveling with a dog and the hotel is pet-friendly. Breakfast was fine."
"1557",3,"The location was decent but some of the noise from the freeway was loud..and some unsavory characters were hanging around late at night"
"1558",5,"Front desk staff really embodied the aloha spirit. Chech in/out was the smoothest process I ever experienced. And they took the time to customize our accommodations. Heated pool and fresh homemade waffles at continental breakfast was an unexpected treat. Hotel is energy concious which I loved about them. And what's not to love Great location + great service great time."
"1559",5,"seamless, clean, friendly stay in a good location just off the water in Harbor east. nice morning breakfast. Nice premium hotel in a convenient area."
"1560",3,"We have stayed at this property several times during trips we made between Des Moines, IA and Richmond, KY before moving to Richmond in Dec. 2013. The is an older property which, we think, needs to be upgraded. The appearance shows wear however, our room was clean and quiet for a property located on a busy in town highway. The... More"
"1561",5,"it was very clean. the people were very friendly. it was right on the harbor so everything was walking distance."
"1562",3,"While everything was ""OK"", there was nothing special or even extra OK about this hotel. The walls are paper thin, it's right off of the freeway, no free breakfast........ Just OK."
"1563",4,"Nice hotel/ great location"
"1564",5,"Very happy all around, would highly recommend"
"1565",4,"We chose Aloft because we were able to use our credit card points towards our stay and it was the closest and cheapest we could find the French Quarter. With that being said we are happy with our choice. When we first arrived we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff Jermal was great. We got to our room on the 12th floor and were happy with the amenities. The room was not as large as I would have thought, but it was comfortable and a non issue since we spent minimal time in the room. There was a coffee pot, a mini fridge, and lots of mirror space. Our view overlooked the Ritz Carlton and we were able to see their pool and patio area- pretty cool. The beds are comfortable and the towels didn't feel like sandpaper. They provide Bliss toiletries which was fine, however, I did not pack shampoo or conditioner and they offered a shampoo conditioner all-in-one which I did not care for (but my husband loved...). The vanity area has intense lighting good for makeup application!The lobby area is very nice and fun. They have a snack area for any cravings you have when you are there- premade salads sandwiches, candy, chips, fruit, yogurt, beer, juice, pop, etc. The lobby bar is very nice- good drinks and a fun environment. Lots of games and fun dcor. LaKisha (I hope I spelled that right!) was very friendly and did a great job. They do offer a pool table and computers/printer which came in handy to quickly print our boarding passes. The only issues we ran into was the room service for our room, they did the bare minimum in cleaning our room. The bed was always made, toiletries and towels were always replaced, however, that was about it. No trash was picked up and nothing was organized. When you go to a hotel, typically they neatly arrange your items so they can clean the room/bathroom/vanity completely, but this was not the case. Our toiletries were shoved to a corner or moved over so they could place new toiletries, I had a half eaten sandwich placed on a shelf instead of being thrown away, the coffee pot wasn't put back or the coffee replenished (but new coffee cups were given), whatever was left on the bed was thrown back on it, there was a bottle cap left on the floor... small things that added up. This wasn't huge issue, but enough of one to notice and let the front desk know as we checked out. Also, the elevator functioned oddly for my husband once. He was brought to the top floor and then back down to the lobby instead of being brought to our floor.. but that was not a huge deal.. just odd!Our friends who were staying on the 11th floor experienced some poor water pressure and cold water, however, we did not.The hotel is in a good location- two blocks from Canal and two blocks up from Bourbon- easy walking! The valet out from was super helpful when we were getting ready to leave by reserving us a taxi so we did not have to wait when we wanted one and put our items in the vehicle while we were checking out to make the process smooth and efficient. All in all, the hotel was a great choice and we'd recommend and stay there again. For being brand new, they did a great job!Fantastic! Thank you for your feedback, with us being a new property, reviewers like yourself help us get better! We are thrilled that you liked the property and all of the outlets like our WXYZ Bar and Re:fuel pantry. We cant wait to have you back here with us again soon.We truly appreciate your review and thank you again for staying with aloftnola.- Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager"

"1568",4,"The stay in the hotel was very pleasant, everything was clean and quiet even with renovations in the lobby. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpfull. The rooms are very big and bed super comfortable."
"1569",4,"I stayed at the Ocean Tower Hotel for a week in early May based on positive reviews from TripAdvisor. These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)"
"1570",3,"Overall our stay was very nice, the room was clean and housekeeping was great about providing new towels/sheets/paper etc... The guy at the front desk had a terrible attitude but it might've been because he was working the overnight shift . All in all we enjoyed our stay and got to stay for 3 nights for a reasonable price 314"
"1571",4,"I arrived early and they were able to check me in. This is a really good example of a Courtyard by Marriott. It is conveniently located for business in Baltimore.

"1572",5,"If you are going to Napa, you must stay at the Hampton Inn Suites. The hotel is very clean, very friendly, and the rooms are updated. Many perks like cookies. tea, coffee in the lobby during the day, complimentary hot breakfast, and a snack bar to take with us to San Francisco. Definitely want to stay at the Hampton Inn Suites again.Dear 48mimiy,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. Definitely staying with us we offer many other perks like 24 hour complementary tea and coffee, in addition to cookies and our on the run breakfast to go bags that are available Mon-Fri 6am to 10am, just swing by the front desk and the bags are available for all our guest. Thank you again for visiting and we hope to see you again. Warmest Regards, Serina Najar."
"1573",5,"This is a very nice place. Rooms were decorated nicely, roomy, and cool! I loved the seating area by the pool, but it does get a bit loud with all of the kids. Would have like an outdoor seating area away from the pool/kids. Wifi was fast, breakfast was good, and there were lots of green spaces for our dogs.... More"

"1575",4,"Modern looking hotel. Room lay out worked for smaller space. I thought is was weird that the door to the room opened directly into the bathroom. Didn't like that there was no self park, but I believe all hotels in downtown New Orleans have that.You'd be correct, most downtown NOLA properties are valet only. We understand Aloft isn't for everyone but truly appreciate you giving us a try. Thanks for staying! Yours in hospitality, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"1576",5,"Target, Wal-Mart, food establishments are in walking distance. The airport is 10 mins away and the shuttle is always available. The property is brand new, every inch of the suite/room was magnificent with the marble in the bathroom. I washed clothes (complimentary wash/dry). Loved it. Workout room has all the up-to-date equipment. Front desk hospitality from beginning to end of my stay. I'm from Los Angeles/Orange County, California, and a very neat and clean person. I will most definitely be back. The drive to Virginia Beach is very close, freeways are right at the location. Highest recommendation and respect for this hotel."

"1579",3,"This was a convenient stop on our road trip along route 90, but the quality was not as good as other Red Roofs. We had to request soap for the shower, and the sheets were worn out. There was a hole in the top sheet.Thank you for sharing your guest experience. We are sorry your guest experience was not everything you expected or deserve. We truly hope you give us another shot in the future."
"1580",4,"Room 116 was a nice sized room with a couch and a king bed. The only downside was that it was basement level. Our window looked out to the knees of passer-by's which meant that we had to keep the blinds closed or people would look down into our room. Zero privacy. Otherwise the hotel was nice and the staff did a good job. No complaints."
"1581",4,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at this property. It was located within walking distance to Canal and Bourbon St. The only unexpected things were the price of parking and the 50 a day hold on our card. The hold is refunded though."
"1582",4,"I would have given this hotel 5 stars except my TV and internet went out during a heavy rain storm. The staff was pleasant and when my double room wasn't ready they upgraded my to a king."
"1583",3,"Bad: I will write in English so the staff can read if they wish: we arrived exactly at 4 PM (declared check in time), the room was not ready, the reason being 20 people having done an early check in, please notice that check out time is 11 AM (so they clearly have a workforce planning problem)! An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message. At that time your room will be available!. So we went to the pool (definitely small and overcrowded), no seats available, very noisy. We waited, and waited and waited and waited... 2 hours and 20 minutes, then I went back to the lobby extremely upset, I started complaining and magically the room was ready... By the way: the text message never arrived. Good: Free parking (is this something to be appreciated)"
"1584",5,"This was hands down one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Granted I wasn't spending a lot of time around a pool or in my room but its located nicely and had amazing beds. The most important factor was the customer service. When I pulled into this hotel in my taxi, the staff was out the door to... More"
"1585",4,"Good value, had a shuttle to our concert, friendly staff. The room was clean and modern. The staff was friendly and helpful at check in. Told us about the shuttle to the concert and gave us the taxi number."

They have great breakfast and they even let my guests and I hang out in the lobby after the wedding! It was so much fun and the service was great! In the weeks leading up... More"
"1587",3,"Staff was great. Room was fairly clean only we would not sit on the sofa...many stains on cushions. When checking room before we left and found a pizza box in refrigerator that we did not put in there. Will do in a pinch"
"1588",5,"This property was delightful in every way -- the perfect place to celebrate my birthday! The decor was unique and our rooms were very comfortable, functional and stylish,. The pool view afforded us a surprisingly quiet stay, particularly given the proximity to Duval Street. Paul and Tripp at the bar were both amazing, each in his own way. They are artists behind the bar, brewing (literally sometimes) concoctions that are different from anything I've ever tasted, but each was really special. And what can I say about Andrew in the kitchen He cooked our tuna and snapper catch in 3 courses, and they were nothing short of magnificent. Again, like nothing I've ever had before. I LOVE this place, and will undoubtedly be back again, hopefully before too long!Thank you so much for your review, we are so delighted your birthday was a success. It tickles me to hear all the great evaluations you have for our staff. I must mention Andrew has this unequivocal desire to please, he lives to see peoples expressions after their first bite. Its good to know we've made a new friend, hope to see you again soon."
"1589",4,"Bad: Air conditioning wasn't working when we arrived, but the maintenance person fixed it. Good: Location friendly staff."
"1590",1,"I didn't stay. I checked in for about an hour and was totally disgusted from what I saw and smelled..Room was dirty, the sliding glass door was broken and it had no screen to cover the door if u opened it. Furniture was broken, the refrigerator was dirty, the curtains had cigarette burns and dirt marks all over them. I would not recommend this hotel at all."
"1591",3,"The hotel was really nice! Although the room furniture was a little outdated, I had no complaints otherwise. A shuttle to the Metro was perfect! The staff was really friendly and accomodating. If you want a DC vacation without the expense or hassle of traffic, stay at this hotel!"

"1593",5,"5 star service and amenities at a 3 star price!"
"1594",1,"We got to the hotel about an hour or two early and asked if we could check in early and the receptionist said no, not until check in time. Understood so me and my friend grabbed food. We got back to the hotel and checked in. We walked into our first room and it was a disaster. There were holes in the bed sheets and they had a rank smelled. We went back to the front desk and changed our room. In the second room, the bed sheets had black stains and rips in them. So I went back to the front desk and changed again. The third room - one of the beds had holes and rips in the bed sheets. I went back to the front desk and expressed my frustration. She said she would have a house maid change the bed sheets. The next morning when we went to shower there was only 1 bath towel in the shower. We called the front desk and they said they would have towels to our room quickly. About 30-40 mins later, a hotel maid comes to our door and hands us a small face/hand towel saying all the other towels are getting washed right now. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had."
"1595",5,"Bad: Wish there was a hot tub after walking around town all day. The breakfast was a too expensive. Good: Great location! Room was nice and clean, very modern. There was 6 of us and we got the two double beds and pull out couch. We all slept comfortably."
"1596",4,"This was a great hotel, great location!!! Check-in was quick, check-out was even faster! The room was just as pictured, beautiful ocean view from the balcony. The one and only issue we had was no hot water on two occasions. We will definitely stay again when we return to Virginia Beach!!!"

Staff is Top Notch !!! Very friendly and attentive to the guest needs. Will be my CdA Home Away from Home !!!"
"1598",5,"Comfort Suites was so accommodating to us during our visit. We made an error and did not book the last night of our stay. Even tho they were fully booked for Saturday night, the staff did everything they could to successfully find us a room. Thank you again! Also, bedding and pillows are wonderful!"
"1599",5,"Thank you Erik for taking care of my friends and I! You made sure everything was taken care of the whole day and even gave us a few places to visit while we're here! The pool was super clean along with the rooms and we have so much fun so far:) we will definitely be returning :) thanks again Erik!"

The room is ready... More"
"1602",3,"Stay was OK. They took a 50.00 temp. auth. charge on my credit card for a pre-paid room. That was ok, but it is not 5-2-14, and the charge hasn't as yet been removed. I was told the temp charge would be removed within 3 work days. I'm not happy about this."
"1603",3,"Hotel was generally good but the breakfast was extremely disorganized, slow, and eventually i just gave up."
"1604",5,"What an experience....... Old on the outside.....New modern on the inside. Our room was Small but when in the keys you don't spend a lot of time in the room. First class service. Valet Parking which you need if u stay downtown. There is a 30 fee for parking but it's worth it. The reception room is very unique and the bar is beautiful. It does have a pool and gardens are beautiful. It's close to Malery park to watch sunsets and is by all the restaurants and bars.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We always appreciate feedback whether it is good or bad and we are ecstatic that you had a great stay with us. Please come back and see us again, we would be delighted to have you!"

The gym had... More"
"1609",4,"Bad: The complimentary breakfast was not good at all. Kinda a joke. Very disappointing. For the money we spent for the room we expected a bit more. Good: Staff was nice and helpful. Room was clean and somewhat nice."
"1610",5,"The hotel is right across the river from the Trump Hotel. It's a 50 cab ride from the airport. Watched a Cubs game while there. Wrigley field wasn't too far away by taxi. Plenty of shopping and dining in the area. There is a Irish Pub just around the corner from the hotel. Across the street is a running / walking path along the river. Great for people watching. Would stay here again."
"1611",5,"Came here after a 7 hour drive down from Nags head and it was the perfect stop- definitely worth more than the 3*!! It's lovely- cute little outdoor pool- lovely large room, I made use of the gym and it was amazing! Loads of equipment- would definitely stay again!"
"1612",5,"We were very happy with the quality and cleanliness of the hotel. When shelling out money for a hotel these are important things for me. Yet, I don't want to pay high end prices to get them. This hotel had met these things at the right price."
"1613",5,"That was the best most comfortable hotel stay I've ever had. Good breakfast and very friendly staff. I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to VA Beach."
"1614",4,"No problems here. Just an overnight stay before moving down the road. This is very close to I-78. Some road noise, but not bad all things considered. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was typical for Holiday Inn Express. Wi-Fi speed was a solid 5 up and 5 down."
"1615",4,"I have stayed at this property many times and they consistently meet expectations. The hotel in centrally located next to the Consol Arena. A short walk to downtown buildings and Duquesne University. Hop in a car and you are a few minutes from the Strip District, South Side, stadiums and museums. This hotel is up to the Marriott standards. The... More"
"1616",4,"Bad: I didn't care about some of the staff attitude they could have been a little more friendlier towards the guest at the hotel,and I think it was a little to pricey for the stay. Good: I liked how clean the hotel was and the comfort of the room. The breakfast was good as well."
"1617",4,"Linda the front desk gal was just Awesome, we would recommend this hotel for sure. Food was great for breakfast, our room was clean and the bed comfortable. The service was amazing from Linda at the front desk, to the cleaning ladies, sweet people.Dear Traveler, Thank you for posting a review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay. I will share this review with Linda and staff. Thank you mentioning Linda, she really enjoys her job. Sincerely, Vickie W."

"1619",5,"First, this place is super quaint and cute. Some of my biggest takeaways were: - Location was great, considering we had our 10 month old baby girl with us. No one treated us differently because we were there as a family. - Rooms were a little dim for me, but they were clean and decorated very nicely. - Loved the... More"

"1627",3,"I reserved a room that turned out to be designed for a handicapped person, with all the fixtures, closet rods, ironing board, desks, etc., being much too low for my comfort. I was not made aware, in advance that the room was so designed. I am 6'4, so the accommodations were unusually uncomfortable for me. I was offered another room, but the hotel was unable to change my room due to it being reserved and paid via Expedia. I contacted Customer Service, and it is now 21 days, and I have yet to receive a response. I paid for 3 days, but only stayed for 2, as the accommodations were just unacceptable. I spent my last night at a competing hotel for about the same price, without issue. Of course I did not reserve that room via Expedia."
"1628",5,"Great location ten min walk to bourbon/French quarter! The place is modern and funny and very clean. The staff is super friendly l. Stacy was very helpful and loved her energy. She helped us book a last min trip for the city/cemetery tour. You can tell she really likes what she does. Love the southern accent! I would def recommend this place!! YAY Stacy!! I will be sure to share your kudos with her as well as our entire staff. Thanks for choosing ALOFT NOLA for your stay, we hope to see you again on your next visit.Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"1629",4,"This hotel is, to put it gently, a little out of the way. But it's close to major routes (93, 495) and the town of Andover is a short drive away as are Lowell and Lawrence. So being tucked into the woods gives it the advantage of being very quiet. The facility is clean, cool and comfortable. The rooms are... More"

"1632",3,"I booked this hotel for one night, because I was attending a funeral. The stay was ok. Nothing bad, nothing great. However, they charged my credit card on top of already having paid through Expedia. I called eleven times to get things straightened out and left messages with three different managers. NOBODY will apologize. This was on my check-card, needless to say it messed up my balance and i couldn't even buy gas to get home!!!!!! It was hard enough with a toddler, funeral and now this!!"

"1634",5,"Good: Westin has always the most comfortable beds"
"1635",4,"Hotel room had great view. Was clean. Chic. And accommodating. However the air conditioning kept my partner from sleeping well that night. We stayed on 20 floor and in July Kansan heat he got hot. When we arrived the fridge was warm and barely cooled off our food."
"1636",5,"This is by far the best Hampton Inn my wife and I have ever stayed in, and we've been in quite a few. For that matter, it's one of the best of its class among all of the hotels we've known. We had a nice, clean suite, quiet, well lit, neatly arranged with a desk/divider between the very comfortable bed and the sitting area. Staff were friendly and polite, the breakfast good, prices reasonable. Little notes left by the cleaners were a nice touch. Our only complaint was that the wireless Internet kept dropping out on checkout the desk clerk apologized and said that the hotel has been trying to solve this problem (our room also had an ethernet cable, unusual these days, but I hadn't brought an adapter for my laptop). In spite of this - not enough to affect the rating - highly recommended!"
"1637",1,"My husband and I had to stay at this hotel for one night. I have never been to such a terrible place. I have been to the 3rd world countries, but have not seen such a shabby room. The room was disgusting (although the sheets seemed clean). The furniture had spots, tear, and looked like it was picked up off the curb. Nightstands and table had cigarette burns on them. The most terrible thing was that the room reeked of nicotine! I had a hard time sleeping because of the smell. When I got home I had to wash all my clothes. No one should stay in this hotel, unless for punishment! This hotel is a 4-floor building and the elevator is not working, which seems permanent. There is is no phone in the room, so if we had a problem, we needed to go downstairs and then back up."
"1638",5,"We were so impressed with the entire environment of this awesome resort. It had everything for a relaxing weekend that a couple would want. We had some awesome meals at all the restaurants on property, enjoyed the fitness center and the Marilyn Monroe SPA, what else can a couple ask for."
"1639",3,"Let me say upfront that this could have been a 4 star resort. Gave it three due to the treatment we received upon arrival. We arrived early to the Konea tower, knew a room would likely not be ready and even said to the lady working we know we're early. The front desk clerk proceeded to curtly (and that's using... More"
"1640",3,"Great location, views, ammenities but hotel was not clean, older hotel, room small, elevator slow, staff not that friendly, tv didnt work till we got it fixed, AC did not work well."
"1641",4,"This is your basic nice clean hotel. We have stayed here twice due to work in the area and needed a safe secure place to park our work vehicle. The price usually fits our budget and the staff have always been pleasant. Rooms are nice and the location is within walking distance to the beach and lots of dining. We... More"
"1642",4,"We enjoyed three nights at the Park Vue Inn and really loved the location. The family triple room was fine for our family of four. The pool was great and well used. We didn't realise until our final morning that breakfast was complimentary - perhaps guests could be informed on check-inn. I also loved the guest laundry. Overall I would... More"
"1643",5,"The manager Robert and Nature were very courteous and professional. Great Breakfast and a reception is held on Wednesday night for guests. We were extremely pleased with this hotel and would definitely stay again. Entire staff was great."
"1644",5,"The facility is nice and has a great lobby and bar for happy hour events. Enjoyed my stay which was nice and quiet. The renovated rooms were very comfortable."
"1645",5,"Good: Lovely helpful staff"
"1646",5,"Could not fault the Carneros Inn - although high end, worth every penny. The Boon Fly Cafe is great for breakfast, but exceptional for dinner. Does great cocktails and their Fried Chicken was the best I've ever had."
"1647",5,"SUPER NICE HOTEL!! Highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Super friendly staff, rooms are really really clean, delicious hot and cold breakfast items (complimentary) and are replenished the entire time, so you don't get left with the scraps if your running late, 24/7 hot fresh coffee in the lobby, and they even have yummy fresh cookies on the front desk to grab after a long day at the job. It's the small things, like the receptacle outlets located ABOVE the nightstand so you don't have to do furniture reconfigurations to plug in your phone! The internet stays on. Yea, it really stay on all the time with no unexpected drops. Also, the TV is real TV....not the Hotel-Guided limited channel system. So, believe me when I say this is a nice hotel. It really is. ) It's safe....quit looking.....book, now."
"1648",5,"This family-run lodge exceeded any and all expectations we had from the moment we arrived. The stunning grounds located off a flowing river and surrounded by trees were matched only by the tremendous warmth and generosity of the people running the resort. It's hard to a imagine a more perfect place for a group retreat or a family getaway."
"1649",5,"We made our third overnight stop at this hotel in 2015 and once again were very pleasured with it. The rooms have been very clean, the staff welcoming and attentive, and the breakfast better than most continental breakfasts."
"1650",4,"Only positives to take away from my stay as short as it was. Regular room was move like a mini-suite. Clean and spacious. Free breakfast was good. Small bar area prevented me from having to leave the hotel. Nice touch."
"1651",5,"Had a great time at our friend and mentor's 90th birthday party! It was great seeing so many old friends and acquaintances. Setting was great at Regattabar, food exceptionally good.

Although the room was a bit small, there was a gift bag of refreshments and water awaiting me in my room as well as lemon infused ice water all day in the lobby and fresh flowers in... More"
"1654",5,"The hotel staff were so helpful and friendly. The free breakfast was very good. There is a nearby shuttle to the historic district but they do not run late at night. However, Taxi fares are reasonable."
"1655",1,"Mold in the first three rooms they showed me. Not until they sent me to the top floor in the fourth room did I find a room that didn't smell of mold. Good service willing to help, and very attentive, but they need to fix the mold in their rooms."
"1656",2,"Comfortable bed for the night. My first impression was quite good for the price. Then I opened the closet door and discovered the garbage from a previous guest (ancient pizza in box, used plates, used napkins) stacked inside. Looked like it had been there a long, long time. It's amazing how fast your impression of a place can change. Wish the person at the desk had been a little more concerned about it when I told her. I did not leave with a great impression of the place."
"1657",4,"A beautiful, historic hotel in a perfect location with a fantastic staff (and great bar). The only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star review is the forced air heating system in our room, the vent for which was located over the bed and kicked on every so often, waking us up with an initial blast of cool breeze before it warmed up..."

Thank you for the fantastic review and we hope have you back again soon."
"1660",4,"The hotel staff was friendly and at service. Room was nice and clean. breakfast was pretty good. The ameneties and toiletries option was good if you forget anything. If you stay at hotel than this is good hotel for the price"
"1661",5,"We had an outstanding time here, right near the beach and minutes from the Boardwalk. We would recommend this hotel to anyone"
"1662",3,"Bad: Check in staff was rude. Concierge never called back after leaving my information. Doors slamming in hallway could hear in my room. Double Queen Room was not a true Queen size. Have to pay for wifi. Good: Atmosphere Bedding Location"
"1663",5,"We arrived late at night and were greeted by a terrific young woman who went out of her way to assist us. Her name is FELICIA.

"1665",5,"Bad: Breakfast was not very large for the price of the hotel. Good: Everything about this place was great!"
"1666",4,"This is is fine old motor inn - old school with the parking lot in the middle. The rooms were big and clean and still had many of the old features - old tiles etc. The staff was friendly and helpful - it was inexpensive and a good place to stop for the night before going into San Francisco."
"1667",3,"The hotel was fairly close to our destination. It was clean, staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. Frozen entrees for sale which was convient for travelers who didn't want to go out. No close restraunts close,without crossing the four lane highway.

"1670",1,"I have never been treated so badly in my entire life. I have called this people so many times to ask questions regarding friends comin over for as me have in a lil get together. An every one of my questions where answered wrong cause they made it a point to ruin my night. My friends where not allowed to go to the public bar or swim they told me on the phone the was open til 11. once we got there they said it closed at 8 I guess it was cause we where black an they thought they where talkin to a white person on the phone. They said my guest where welcomed once they got there they stopped them from comin up once again guess it was cause we where black. I will never return to this hotel from hell again. An also they let people order drinks under your room number wit out gettin permission from the person the room is from wow is all I got to say.Dear Sasha, We strive to deliver an exceptional experience for our guests at NOPSI Hotel, but this evidently did not occur during your visit.

"1672",3,"Hidden away from heavy traffic"
"1673",5,"Bad: The view. Good: Everything"
"1674",3,"My room or hallway didnt smell funny, the staff was friendly helpful, and there wasn't any loud noises or unruly guests. I had hotwater and the heater worked. As far as the room itself, you get what you pay for..No hangers, old furniture poor tv reception/wifi. The bed was comfortable enough. If you just need a place to crash or need to save this place works. Things that made me giggle: the phone in the room was from the Marriot in another state, the sheet that had the list of tv channels had a different hotel name on it, the advertisement for a pizza place that will deliver to your room has relocated and no longer does the keycard does not have the Inn's name on it but does have another pizza advertisement (different place) all over it again says they will deliver to your room, ya, no its out of the area."
"1675",5,"After a long drive it was nice to come to a nice, comfortable hotel and a quiet one."
"1676",2,"You get what you pay for. I will leave it at that."
"1677",5,"Very nice motel on busy intersection, but rooms are located toward back of property so noise not too bad. Interior corridor access restricted w/card lock opened w/room key so w/level of additional security for single woman. Has elevator to 2nd and 3rd floors. Room spotless, clean, everything in great condition. Newfangled heat/AC controls w/instructions (thank goodness!) worked well. Shower w/shower massage-very nice touch. Was very comfortable stay. Would definitely stay again."
"1678",2,"The Hotel Laguna has location -- on the beach and in downtown Laguna. That's about all it has the facility is very tired and in need of a complete renovation.

Crazy bathroom showers that are completely surrounded by clear glass and open to the bedroom. Wierd and cool at the same time. But there is a button for the privacy curtain if preferred. Recommend staying on the 3rd floor or higher... More"
"1681",4,"We thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience in this recently opened dining room. The steak can only be described as succulent. The wait staff was professional and attentive. The atmosphere was warm combining contemporary furnishings with what I assume to be 19th century architecture. We really enjoyed the jazz band which performed in a smallish room adjacent to the bar."
"1682",5,"The accommodations at the Hampton Inn and Suites were pleasant, but the hotel staff is amazing, friendly, and willing to ensure your stay is memorable. Everyone from the maid service to the front desk and general managers helped make the prolonged stay in the Fort Lewis, WA area as great experience as possible."
"1683",5,"A coworker I went to see the Jimmy Buffett concert. Just stayed the night but had a gorgeous oceanfront room. Hotel was pretty full but quiet. Free HOT continental breakfast was good, lots of choices. Would definitely stay again, especially when the weather is warmer not so windy!!"

"1685",4,"The room was a lot nicer than I expected. The hotel staff at the front desk was amazing. Very helpful. Clean good smelling rooms. Pretty pool. Breakfast had hardly anything very cramp and not worth it. We left and went to McDonalds. The wifi was terrible. They gave me a wifi password at the front desk and when I went... More"
"1686",5,"Better with more extras like breakfast. Preferred place to sleep for conference."
"1687",2,"Clean hotel but the noise and vibrations from people walking outside to the bathroom fans in other rooms reverberated right through the bed. very poor insulation. Definitely not worth 140 a night. Napa city is highly over rated. If you are going for wine, then stay in the small towns up the valley like St Helena.Thank you for your review. I am sorry for any noise you encountered during your stay with us. I will look into the fan noise and get it replaced at once."
"1688",5,"Great location and wonderful service"

"1690",2,"Rooms are clean. Staff is great. The Mix appetizers are quite good. Really nothing negative EXCEPT that their internet speed is capped at 2 Mbps DL and less than 1 Mbps UL, which is inadequate for anyone on business expecting to upload or download anything. There is no high speed option available, even at a premium. This aspect caused me... More"
"1691",5,"I was very pleased with this hotel. it was clean and near the airport which is where me and my husband for a flight our of Ft. Lauderdale the next morning. The front desk was helpful. Parking was very easy. And it was not far from the main attraction, Ft Lauderdale Beach. We would definitely stay again :)"
"1692",4,"Ok Hotel near Rice University and Medical Centers. Not much to do after dark."
"1693",5,"Everything I needed was provided in a nice comfortable room."
"1694",4,"If you are looking for a nearby hotel your headquarter offices, specially Mercedes Benz, this would be a perfect choice. It has all the needed services, nice restaurant and they offer you a shuttle service to and from office without charge."
"1695",5,"Great Room, Great Staff!! Would recommend to anyone staying in that area."
"1696",2,"If I knew how far away and the sketchy neighborhood this hotel was, I never would have stayed there. There is nothing but fast food in the area and walking after dark is questionable. The room smelled of cleaning chemicals, the wireless service was weak, and maintenance did not come when called. No hairdryer - had to call the desk for one. Toilet paper holder falling off wall. They did a good job making this hotel look good in the pictures, but it was run-down. The van did come when they said it would, but be prepared to wait a long half-hour if you miss it."

"1700",5,"Bad: Nothing. Good: Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. The cleanliness of the facility was also great. We have stayed at the Westin a few times and will continue in the future."
"1701",5,"I was attending a conference at the River Hotel (January 30-31, 2016). This was purely business so I wanted to minimize my stress by staying at (or near) the conference location by being able to fly in, then shuttle to from O'Hare airport and yet have plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel. The River Hotel found me a small room for a VERY reasonable (unbelievable) rate. Yes, I have read the reviews about the small rooms. This one was small. There was one queen sized bed, a desk, a pull out work station, and a full (shower) bath. Period. No extras. Yet it met MY needs (listed above) and my usual criteria of CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, and SAFE. The staff was EXCELLENT. I received friendly, efficient 5 star service for a 3 star price - from every single employee shift - both day night. I received free bottled water from a water station in the hallway. The vending machines were reasonable. My 17th floor small room, overlooked the river, the Trump Tower, the River Walk, and the city lights and sounds only added to the ambiance. I took the elevator down, crossed the lobby, took another elevator up to the conference (the two elevators - activated only by your room key card - ensured that the guest rooms were secure from being accessed by non guests). Even the conference was well prepped and attended by the hotel staff with fresh coffee, tea, and complimentary sodas that were refreshed at every break. I could continue... But suffice it to say that I was IMPRESSED. YES. My room was small. However, the break in price was compensation for this and (since I was only needing work space sleep) I did not NEED more. That said, if I am ever in Chicago again - for work or vacation - I WILL be back. NOTE: The hotel has an on site Italian Restaurant called Bella Bacinos. I will review it separately. For now, suffice it to say the food was DELICIOUS, the service was also 5 star, and the price - while not as inexpensive as I am accustomed to - was as affordable (more so) than comparable places nearby. Just be aware that a small is a medium... a medium is a large... etc. Yum!Dear John S,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your detailed review of your experience.We are so proud of our staff services as well as our prime location and are delighted you were pleased as well. There is nothing I like more than sharing great comments with the team and I will certainly pass along your kind words.We are beyond thrilled to know we are your hotel of choice when visiting Chicago. We will look forward to welcoming you back soon!"
"1702",4,"I stayed here with some friends for a convention. It was a good room and the free breakfast was nice."
"1703",2,"The staff was super friendly. 5 stars for the young gentleman who checked us in. The physical property is seriously in need of repair. The breakfast area was fairly dirty - trash cans and cabinets covered in residue. Ramada needs to invest some in taking care of the property. Give the wonderful employees something to be proud of."
"1704",5,"My family stayed here during my niece's wedding and really enjoyed it. The rooms were clean, large and contemporary in their decor. The beds were VERY comfortable as well. The free morning breakfast was AWESOME - complete with made to order omlettes, pancakes / waffles, fresh fruit more. I also thought the service was great. My elderly dad has... More"
"1705",4,"Bad: We came in the evening after a long business journey and I was pulling the luggage for me and my assistant in and there was no one to assist me , two people walked by and the third finally asked me if I needed help. I was not please. Then, I had booked a room with two beds and they sent me to a room with king size bed. I had to go back to front desk with my luggage. The front desk person was great she upgraded us to a suite on the executive floor and turned the situation around. Good: The staff was very accommodating to the problems we had at check in and made a bad situation much better. the customer service was excellent at the front desk"
"1706",4,"Room was large and had a balcony facing towards the beach. It was a bit dated but kept in very good condition. Location is great, just one block from the boardwalk."
"1707",5,"I have booked this hotel for employees on several trips for an installation project in town. I have gotten several great reports from each trip by employees. The staff and manager are always kind, courteous, and on top of things. Rooms are always clean and inviting. The hotel is centrally located for restaurants, beach, businesses, and shopping."
"1708",5,"Wonderful hotel. Very helpful and welcoming. I would love to stay at this Super 8 anytime."
"1709",2,"We chose this facility based on location and website and offerings. I was VERY disappointed and would not recommend. The suite was unclean with items in disrepair. Ordered a chilled champagne and flutes and had a warm bottle of champagne and dirty flutes upon arrival."
"1710",4,"Could not get good internet access in the room. My granddaughter sat in the hallway on the first floor for good access. There were a lot of loud patrons slamming doors well after midnight."
"1711",5,"It is close to resturants and stores.Great hotel and activities. They think of everything. Customer service is absolutly great. Room has coffee maker and the coffee they provide is starbucks. we will difinitly be back in our future trip. Thank you!"
"1712",2,"The location of this place is prime. The hotel condition, on average is nice. I found my room fantastic, with a kitchenette and living room. The elevators were old and confusing (only one went to the garage, but you could not call just that one and there were no stairs).Breakfast was average-- the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the waffles/french toast.Some of the staff were kind and helpful, but many didn't seem to care and others seemed new. Maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay. There are two kiosks at the front desk, and a phone between. While I was checking in, the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer, and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days. This was concerning, distracting, and off-putting. This also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her job.One night, we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight. The banging, accompanied by yelling, continued for several minutes. Worried and scared, I called the front desk, but the person who answered didn't seem to care about the situation and at first didn't offer a solution until I asked if there was nothing they could do, and they said they would send somebody up there again. The front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door. By this point, the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour (by her account-- overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door). I'm worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long. What if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency, or had never opened the door Nobody followed up with us regarding this issue, which was disappointing. Had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience, I likely wouldn't be writing this review.Upon checkout, the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference I was attending because my partner was performing the checkout. Overall, I was really let down by my stay here. The rooms are so nice and the location is great. I thought the Hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great, seamless customer experience, but it didn't seem like they cared.Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us. First, I offer my sincere apologies for the poor care shown to you by my team. We are in the process of training several new additions to our staff but this does not excuse the lack of professionalism and lack of interest in resolving your concerns promptly and with care. Please know that I have addressed your concerns with my team so that we can continue to improve our quality of care. If I can be of any additional assistance, please contact me directly."
"1713",5,"We came to Warner Robins with our team for the State Wrestling Tournament and enjoyed our weekend trip due to this lovely place! Machonda was very sweet and gave us directions to the nearest ATM. The room was nice and I love that we were given the option of fluffy or firm pillows!!"
"1714",4,"Bad: Hidden fees for amenities."
"1715",2,"Bad: Spa (No pool and No available time). Breakfast. Good: Breakfast wasn't ready. No coffee, no plates, nothing in the hot thing. Really a disapointment."
"1716",4,"Very good hotel, but the close proximity to the toll highway made it a little on the noisy side. ps Why does Chicago, or is it Illinois, charge 1.90 for the toll road and not 2.00 Just seemed odd to someone from a land with no toll roads."
"1717",4,"Located between Nashville and Knoxville it was a nice place to stop overnight. Nice and clean and new. Plenty of near by restaurants and gas stations. Easy access to the highway. Hot breakfast."
"1718",5,"We were heading to Canada at the beginning of August and couldn't find anywhere to stay. We have been driving already for 11hrs and it was almost midnight when we found this motel.

"1722",5,"Bad: Not much. Good: For several years, a group of us has met for the SEMA SHOW. We have always come over a day early, and met for fun and dinner at your 777 Microbrewery. This time we were booked at MAIN STREET STATION as well.We'll be back, particularly since you didn't charge resort fees."
"1723",5,"I got a 'thank you for staying with us' email with the above words in it. On my last trip I had just left the Suncoast and was talking to a slot attendent at the Mirage who also likes the Suncoast. He asked why I liked it so much and I said I did not know - now I know - I feel so comfortable here. I stay at the Suncoast for 2-3days every 2months as part of a longer10-11 day holiday. It is not the Strip but it is still a nice casino - a locals casino with bowling, a cinema and bingo hall. But it also has a conference centre / banuet hall. You do not look out over the Strip but you can look out over a golf course and their nice pool area. When I stay on the Strip I actually ask for a Mountain View room - rather than a view of McDonalds and Walgreens! Even though I am a semi regular I am treated as a local. If I room charge I do not need to show ID - that's OK - we know you. The Cocktail waitresses even remember what I like to drink. They like my English accent! I had changed the dates of mt stay and the receptionist spotted that my dining credit had not been carried over so she corrected that. They now have sofas for the rest of your party can rest while you sign-in. The area is smoke-free - for those not used to casinos but I still say I do not recognise the casino as being smokey. I like the buffet for breakfast (8.50 inc tax) but then Du-Pars for Dinner where I can sit and have the food brought to me. The wine is 5 a glass 4-7pm - a nice end to the day. I'm interested in trying PengZu. The menu is on the Suncoast website and has some interesting dishes that attract this 61yo white guy. For burgers etc they have The Game sportsbar or the bowling alley snack bar - I have enjoyed both. Some days I do not feel hungary but I am tired so I get a Subway and a bottle of wine from the Gift shop (Glen Ellen Cabenet 4) and retire to my room. There is a refrigerator in the room. Du-Pars do the room service but the menu was missing from my room the last two trips. At some hotels that would be an issue but not at the Suncoast. My next trip will be in May with a suite at NYNY, a room at the Suncoast and a suite at the Mirage. I have asked for a Tuscany suite on eStandby. If I do not get it I will be happy with my 550sqft Suncoast room with floor to ceiling windows. I can get a bus from outside NYNY (or the airport) to the Suncoast for 2 - the Westcliffe Express (WAX). The bus can take me back to the Strip and somedays it has taken me to Downtown to visit the Suncoast's sister properties.Awesome! We love to see five-star experiences. We are glad our mission is fulfill through you experience with us! Thank you for visiting us! See you again, next time!"

"1727",4,"Was looking for a place to sleep that was clean and easy to get on and off Interstate 90, that didn't cost and arm and a leg. The reviews on this motel were good so I went with it.

The room was comfortable and had everything we needed for our date night! Thank you so much!"
"1762",5,"My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!"
"1763",5,"Nice hotel with a lovely pool. Near to Newport Beach. It is on a busy intersection and is hard to get in and out of. Otherwise the rooms are quiet and clean. The restaurant is pleasant but the service was slow even though they were not busy. Easy access to John Wayne Airport."

"1801",4,"Bad: Breakfast, though a big step up from the basic continental breakfast, was a little disappointing. The hot option was a choice of three different flatbreads that you can toast yourself. Also, it's only served from 6AM-9AM, fine for business travelers but a bit early for our weekend visit. Good: The hotel seems to cater to long-stay visitors, so the room was set up like a small apartment with couch, TV, desk, and well-equipped kitchen area with a full-sized fridge, plates and silverware, microwave, and dishwasher. Furniture and decor were modern and well thought-out."
"1802",5,"We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great. Gave great recommendations and lots of coupons for stuff on Duval Street.Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn Suites at The Keys Collection for your recent travels to Key West. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay."

"1804",5,"Bad: I understand it is a japanese hotel but the American breakfast was terrible. I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant."

Good: Very good location on Ocean Drive but away from the noise of the main area.

Staff always acknowledged you"

"1826",3,"We were disappointed in the room - however, I will say that if you're looking for a small place with a great view and a really nice park directly across the street, this place is perfect. Also, the rooftop bar was great - although a bit pricey. Our disappointment was in the room itself, which was extremely small and not at all comfortable - overall felt like it was way too much money for such an uncomfortable room."
"1827",5,"Bad: Would've loved a bit larger rooms. We ended up having to get a second room for our kids (older kids) since the suite was simply too tight for all of us. My husband said the mattress was about ready to be replaced. And we thought it was funny that there was a sign on the toiletries, saying that they would charge for these if taken home. But overall, we really had a great time and loved the environment. Good: Loved the staff - very friendly and helpful with good recommendations. We loved the attached restaurant for coffee and breakfast. The overall atmosphere was very cool and well done. And the location for us was great."
"1828",1,"The worst hotel stay I've ever had. On the positive side there was a hiphop chicken and fish next door..."
"1829",5,"We just stayed at the Inn by the Lake for the 4th time and had a great trip. We love the location so we can bike or walk most places. The pool is great and has a two level hot tub! the room is nice and I appreciate having a mini fridge."
"1830",2,"Wants to charge extra for everything. Micro wave, Refrigirator and glass of water. Have to wait 15 minutes to get hot water. Also another 15 minutes to bath tub water to drain. We book all most 25 rooms all the same story with bath tub."
"1831",5,"Excellent service"
"1832",4,"Attended a conference here this past weekend. Hotel is not too far off the PA turnpike. Near some local shopping. Free parking. They have an onsite restaurant. Banquet food was rather good. Rooms clean and nice size. Only thing I did not like was the room service dirty dishes that sat in the hallway all weekend."
"1833",5,"The rooms were very nice and spacious! The workers were friendly and very calm even though it was a big event going on in the city. The rooms were very clean and comfy beds. I enjoyed my stay overall.Clean and comfy is music to our ears. Thanks for the great review and we hope you get back to Aloft New Orleans Downtown!"
"1834",5,"The staff went above and beyond to make our stay the best it could be!"
"1835",4,"We stayed here at the last minute, and were a bit nervous that it would be a long walk to the Disneyland Resort front gates. The location turned out very nicely because you are a five minute walk to the parking trams at the Mickey and Friends parking garage. You get to walk backstage at the resort to get to... More"
"1836",5,"The room had a very comfortable bed and a nice rain shower. The room was the perfect size and not too cramped. The fitness center was very nice. It had a lot of hand weights which is rare for a hotel gym. The food/drinks from the restaurant were great. The hotel overall is very clean and very convenient to shopping... More"

"1838",5,"My family took a quick trip to Atlanta to primarily visit the Aquarium. We chose this hotel for its proximity. We were delighted to have a room on the 12th floor facing Centennial Park. The sunrises and sunsets were beautiful, and the night view of the ferris wheel and city lights just lovely. The room was a standard 2 Queen... More"
"1839",5,"Perfect view! Perfect staff! I reserved a room for my family and I, we had such a nice and relaxing time. The room was like an apartment, it felt like home.

"1840",5,"enjoyed the pool and hot tub my grandkids especiallydid"
"1841",5,"Clean, comfortable, good breakfast but parking and internet fee are extra which you have to consider. I decided not to use wifi and used from cell phone data plan. Other than that, everything was good."
"1842",5,"The room was very nice. I can't think of a way it could have been improved. The staff has pleasant and eager to please. I highly recommend this hotel."
"1843",4,"Our family of 3 stayed in a junior suite at the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Buffalo New York. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The hotel is located next to Lafayette Square within walking distance of shops. The hotel staff were very helpful and it was no problem to valet park the car. The nearby Lafayette Hotel has... More"

"1846",5,"This was our second stay at a Drury Hotel and we were impressed once again! The rooms were clean and fair sized, check in was easy and quick. The free drinks and evening snack are such a great feature and you could honestly make a meal of it. The pool is close to the food/beverage area so it is convenient... More"
"1847",5,"Absolutely great service. Only con is that the low-emissions paring is apparently for everyone and is not enforced at all!! Owning a tesla it was very frustrating how tahoe's and escalades could park there and i couldn't!!!!"
"1848",5,"Very clean, good service, nice amenities, beautiful decor. I've stayed here twice for conferences and will go back if I have a chance. Incredible suites! No complaints! And the downtown Louisville area has some great food fairly close to the hotel."
"1849",3,"Overall hotel was good except for breakfast it was the worst I've experienced area is way to small and choices of food on the cheap side. Also nothing is around the hotel it's by itself."
"1850",1,"Just needed a place to stay for the night. Nothing fancy. When I arrived took 45 min to check in. There was another person and I trying to check in only. The man at the desk keep stopping to help everyone who would walk in leaving us just standing there. Even if it was just talking to the random that were walking in. When we finally checked in, there was nowhere to park. People who had rooms on the other side of the hotel was parked on our side so we had no place to park. My husband had to pull behind someone to get our stuff out then drove it to the gasstation and asked if we could park there for the night and he had to walk back to the room. Also, there was a party going on in the next room which wasn't that big of a deal cuz they weren't loud or disturbing us but because of the party they had this man that stood in front of our door trying to sell us drugs as soon as we walked up. Everytime we walked out he kept on. I have a 10 year old daughter that was with us. Called the front to let them know of this man and the guy at the desk just laughed and said oh yea he's here often, he won't bother you. UM I'M CALLING BECAUSE HE IS BOTHERING ME. Worst hotel I ever stayed at.. and I've stayed at some terrible hotels."
"1851",3,"Breakfast is light. The taste of Coffee needs improvement. Breakfast could benefit from addition of cold cuts, smoked salmon, cheeses, freshly baked breads and pastries and omelettes."
"1852",5,"This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again."
"1853",3,"If you don't mind staying in an old hotel for one night for a low rate, then you won't mind staying here. However, this hotel is something from the 1960s and needs alot of updates. Was clean though."
"1854",4,"Hamptons and Hilton brands booked in Charlottesville, decided to stay out of town instead of settling for lesser quality. Glad we did! Only 30 miles on a scenic highway. Beautiful drive to and from C'Ville. Clean, up to date, all we expect from a Hampton Inn. Although not much immediately around hotel there is a gas station and fully stocked... More"
"1855",4,"Bad: Valet is 30 and they do not tell you that. Good: Staff was incredibly friendly"
"1856",5,"Everything was great!! We will definitely stay here the next time we come to Grove City!!"
"1857",3,"Good - Large, essentially one-bedroom apartments. Bad - Aged, and poorly designed. The soft shell of the tub enclosure dipped between the joists when I stood in it. Good - Nice neighborhood. Bad - practically impossible to get a cab on time. Good - housekeeping staff goes out of their way. Bad - Front desk is horrible. They lack procedure, training and capability. Simple tasks were challenging. Don't count on getting a cab through the front desk unless you have 30-60 minutes to wait for one. Call the cab company yourself and make certain they have your name so some other frustrated customer doesn't take your cab. Good - they run a shuttle from the hotel to the Metro. Bad - there is no schedule and you have to look carefully for when they don't run, when they are doing a grocery store run, or when they are running to another facility they service. The Metro is across the street and down half a block from where they drop you off and pick you up. Since you don't know the schedule, you're standing on the street waiting. Dress appropriately and take an umbrella. There is no restaurant in the building. But there is a call in service which delivers food from many restaurants. I recommend this hotel IF you have your own car, are flexible about the age of the building, and don't rely on any services from the front desk."
"1858",4,"Cant beat the location of this hotel. Its a block away from Bourbon street and minutes away from Jackson Square and other attractions. Plenty of restaurants near by. Staff was extremely pleasant. The rooms were nice and clean. No complaints overall. Booked the hotel through a package deal and got a great deal."
"1859",4,"I've stayed at this motel multiple times over the years. This motel works well to give you a nice warm place to stay overnight in the cold winter months. Of the times I've stayed here about once a year, and each year there is some improvement over the years. It's still a cheap option for housing. I personally don't have... More"

"1863",5,"We arrived an hour early and they were able to check us in early which was very helpful. The room was nice as were the amenities. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. We left early and were offered a take away breakfast."
"1864",4,"The hotel is located across the street from the Space Needle. Its also within walking distance to Pike Place Market and other places along the wharf. The hotel is quiet. I never heard another person while in the room and virtually no street noise. Rooms are stylish and the beds are very comfortable. It has a mini kitchenette so if you there for a period of time it would be great. My only complaint is that the clocks in the room were still on Pacific Standard Time, not Daylight Savings. I did not notice this until the morning and was late for an appointment. I tried to change the clock but was not clear on the clock how to change the time. When I checked out I notified the desk that they should check the clocks in the rooms.David B,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. Thank you for the feedback regarding the clock in your suite.

"1866",4,"Nice staff. Good breakfast. Good TV for at night. Only negative is I did not like the type of pillows they had. I like one larger pillow. They had many small pillows.

"1869",5,"Good: I loved the lighting and how comfortable the bed was."
"1870",4,"Bad: Hot tub was very dirty, needed a good wash down and no in house restraunt. The station 10 grill associated with property was good but not located within hotel. Good: We liked the location of the hotel to the activities going on for the week we traveled and it's easy access to beach and boardwalk, breakfast was really good, but gotta get up early to avoid long lines."
"1871",2,"The rooms had 2 double beds instead of 2 queen beds and there were no available cribs or cots for our room. The TV in our room did not work. Other guests were quite loud into the night."
"1872",5,"A gorgeous hotel! Not a typical Hampton Inn. Easy to find and the location is convenient to vineyards, downtown Napa and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and movie theater. Inside the hotel is gorgeous and the guest rooms are all suites and huge! Mini fridge, huge shower, I could live in this room!"

"1874",5,"Hotel provides a list of restaurants nearby. this has nothing to do with the hotel, but be wary of delivery in this area, the food pretty much sucks - at least the chinese and pizza. The hotel is awesome. Shuttle will take you anywhere you need to go nearby. Hotel was service was spot on. Loved my room. Cannot go wrong with Hyatt Place. Clean, Comfy, spacious, reasonably priced. Highest recommendation."
"1875",4,"Very last minute reservation as we finished dinner and started searching for a bed near Kennebunkport. While I don't normally stay at motels, this was a nice surprise.

"1894",5,"The hotel was clean. The staff was excellent. I truly enjoyed my stay."
"1895",4,"Bad: The bathroom needs to be upgraded. It is very worn, the brown wall paper was dirty and the paint on the sink counter was pealing off. was also disappointed the room did not have a coffee maker. I like to have a cup while I get dressed in the mornings. would have liked a non-smoking area in the casino. I am a non-smoker and I had to keep taking breaks and go outside for fresh air. Good: The Beds were great! The location was very good. The gentleman at the Registration desk was very helpful and friendly. And the Lady at the Keno lounge was nice too."
"1896",3,"Bad: The beds were not too comfortable. Good: I really liked its location, and slot machines, the Paradise Buffet, and Duncan Donuts place within the Fremont Hotel."
"1897",3,"The hotel was clean and staff was friendly but the bed was rock solid and after sitting in my car for long due to the weather my back didn't need any help in feeling worse. Breakfast was tasty, but cold in the sitting area being directly in front of the doors where all the cold air came sweeping in."
"1898",4,"Dark rooms because only sliding glass door for sunlight and plantation shutters needed to be propped open (I ised water bottles). No other Windows! Check in people not very friendly. Pool noisy til 10 so had to close sliding door at night. Cracks in stairs and rusty door opening. Pluses: good oatmeal, fruit and coffee in am. Pool is nice . View is nice. Liked kitchenette"
"1899",5,"This was a nice Best Western. We were allowed to check in early. The free breakfast was the best of any hotel I have ever visited because we could choose items of the Denny's menu.

"1902",4,"Staff pleasant, hard to find"
"1903",5,"The hotel was great and just a block away from Discovery Kingdom. They have a shuttle that takes you from the hotel to the park and picks you up later. This will save you 25 a day in parking. The breakfast buffet was a great way to start your day. They have coffee and cold water for you at the lobby 24hrs so that is also a plus. The rooms are spacious with sofa beds and the staff is very friendly. This is a great value and an awesome place for a family trip."

"1905",5,"I say that because I cancelled my second night stay from an awful hotel downtown and booked my second night at the Hotel Lincoln. Best decision I made the whole trip. The room was great (spacious, clean, well furnished and very modern) and the staff was even better. My wife had a bad stomach ache in the middle of the night and I called down to the front desk and asked if they had any Pepto-Bismol. They said no and started telling me where the nearest Walgreen's was and then stopped and offered to get some money from me and go get it for me since it was the middle of the night. I was super greatful and tried to give him a tip, he wouldn't take it. And that is just one example of how excellent the staff was. Next trip to Chicago I'm staying here again!"
"1906",4,"Bad: The room rate was terrible we had a Booking.com rate that was not honoured it soured the stay and was a big difference. We to date have no explanation!. Good: Location"
"1907",4,"I really enjoyed myself. Wish they offered more discounts"
"1908",4,"Their is everything for everyone at the Sun Coast. Every amenity you could want or need ranging from small children to adults. From arcades, bowling alleys, and cheap gambling. A very nice place to enjoy Vegas away from the Strip. Also It is right across the street from some amazing golf courses along with shops and fine dining. A very good choice in my opinion!"
"1909",4,"We stayed at this hotel for the St Patrick's Day Dash in Seattle due to its location. It is a nice hotel, right across the Space Needle. We stayed in a suite... it actually had a full kitchen! Including dishwasher, microwave, garbage disposal, etc... Perfect for a family staying for a few days. Our room was facing other rooms, so when you open your blinds, you will see all the other rooms... kinda creppy, so beware and request a room facing out to the street.The hotel server a hot breakfast and it was actually pretty good. Supervised me how good it was, I even went back for seconds. Hotel has parking... but spaces are very limited and very small.... so leave the Ford350 at home.All in all... excellent hotel and an excellent location.FMH60878,Thank you for taking the time to submit such pleasant comments about us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. We are so ecstatic to hear you enjoyed our fully equipped kitchen in room, morning breakfast spread, and unbeatable location next to the Space Needle. We look forward to hosting you in the future until then, happy travels!Sarah Junge"
"1910",5,"Bad: I needed directions on how to work the shower -took forever to figure out how to get hot water. Good: Close enough to Ocean Drive to walk but far enough off that you didn't have to fight to get into the hotel from the street. Couldn't hear street noise. Comfortable room and great staff."
"1911",5,"Love it."
"1912",3,"Bad: They cannot find my booking ticket when I arrived, and the girl who serve us went to have joke with others, let us wait for her for a long time. Mini bar is empty."
"1913",5,"After the manger saw that i was on crutches he moved me to the first floor in the same type of room, which was great for them to do for me. Bed was great, hot tub was awesome, and staff is amazing. Thanks for a great stay!"
"1914",5,"Bad: The elevator to the parkade requires some maintenance - at least a wet mop to kill whatever is lurking on the floor!. Good: This resort hotel is amazing - the location in perfect, the rooms are huge, and absolutely spotless!"
"1915",5,"Driving through and location was perfect. Hotel was very clean, bed was comfortable, rooms were quiet, breakfast was fresh and well maintained. Fitness room was the best I have been in yet at a hotel. Would totally stay here again."

"1917",4,"Our room was nice, clean and comfortable. We have stayed here previously and can tell they have done a few updates. All the front desk personnel were helpful and friendly. The breakfast area is a bit disorganized and cramped. Food was OK, but nothing exciting. The hotel is well located and convenient to get downtown or anywhere else. We had... More"
"1918",3,"What I didn't like was the room was not good. When you walk in the hotel it looks awesome. But the room looked like you were in a motel rather than a hotel. Also the hotel was under construction from 9am to 7pm. That would have been nice to know before booking a room. The hotel staff were very polite and professional. The breakfast bar was the best breakfast bar I have had in a Hotel. Out of a 1-5, I rate the breakfast bar a 5. The staff were so on point."
"1919",5,"We stayed in one of their penthouses which had a beautiful private balcony. A nice bedroom, kitchen, and lovely living room. Every evening they have wine and cheese, followed by warm cookies. In the morning they have a lovely continental breakfast in the morning. Several blocks to the beach. Great Location. We stayed 5 days and could have stayed more!"
"1920",4,"This place is very nice. However, for the room price, they still make you pay extra for wifi, which I found kinda silly. It's 12.95 for wifi per day. The room itself was in fantastic condition and very clean. No complaints there. Just on a personal note, I found the rooms and decor to be a bit 1960s looking. Kinda... More"
"1921",5,"The Dickinson Hampton Inn Suites is the best Hampton hotel I have stayed in. I have been a Hilton Honors Gold and Diamond member since 2007, and this is the best stay I have ever had with the Hilton properties. This hotel deserves your business if you are traveling to Dickinson ND."

"1925",5,"Loved this hotel. The room and lobby was clean and neat. The room was well appointed with a full refrigerator, microwave, dishes and other amenities to make the longer term stay very comfortable. This hotel is very environmentally friendly and even had enough towel bars/knobs in the bathroom to hang up wet towels so that they could dry and be... More"
"1926",5,"Bad: There's nothing not to like here. Though the maid service was good but they are kind of early to knock at the door for cleaning service. They're there at 8am and we were still in dreamland that we were forced to get up and open the door to talk to them to clean later. Good: We love our very spacious room though we didn't have a single king sized bed. They gave us twin beds but it's fine. The Garden court buffet was also great! It was very affordable. We almost eat there everyday because of its price. Please keep it that way."
"1927",5,"Bad: Noisy in lower floors, but not at all at higher ones. Good: Very comfy beds, great lobby/bathroom"
"1928",5,"I had very low expectations about staying in a motel and was blown away by the hospitality and the cleanliness. What a great family place! I will be going back next year. Mary and Rose are the sweetest hosts!"
"1929",4,"The Maxwell's staff, at every level, do an outstanding job of making you feel welcome. They go that extra step and if you look puzzled, as i did, will ask you what need or are looking for with out being prompted. The rooms were very nice. The bed was comfortable and the hotel in general was quiet. Restaurants and coffee... More"
"1930",4,"The pool area is good - plenty of sun (as opposed to too much shade at some other Strip 5 stars). The day club is tantalising (I'm too old) but not so noisy that it spoils the pool vibe for non-clubbers. It can be a bit tricky to get sunbeams though - and too many are reserved for VIPs and...

"1931",2,"Room had extremely Small beds and windows were single glazed backing onto busy road so very noisey all night Bins were not emptied in 3 night stay Carpets looked really stained and need replacing over all Hotel needs makeover and maintenance jobs as taps leaky and everything run down"
"1932",4,"We stay at this hotel three times this past year while visiting my husbands brother who has been ill. The hotel has friendly personnel and the rooms were clean we would stay there again anytime we come back to the Danville area."
"1933",4,"This was our first time in Baltimore, and the neighborhoods are hit or miss there. This was a pretty good part of town- not much there yet. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel had a smell to it though- there were smoking rooms I think- but the hallway was very musty. Everything looked clean though. The location must have been a newly developed area, there was not much right by the hotel- but it was convenient to hop on the interstate. All in all, we would stay here again"
"1934",5,"Good: Sheet came off and I saw coffee stain on mattress cover. Otherwise, great!"
"1935",5,"Our stay was perfect - from the moment we checked in. The staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the happy hour - great selection of wine and snacks. The room was nice - NYC small but had everything we needed. The bathroom had everything - including bubble bath and toothpaste! Who does that We liked the neighborhood - haven't stayed in Chelsea before, but it was a great location. We cabbed it to Broadway for dinner and a show, but also did lots of walking - including up to the Natural History Museum. It was a short stay, but we can't wait to go back to the Maritime Hotel!"
"1936",5,"My stay was wonderful other than I was double charged for my room so we had to fix that 1 day in but it all got straightened out and I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling .. the management is extremely nice and will help with anything u need ..."

"1938",5,"Bad: Soft mattress on the bed. Good: Nice happy hour drink. Nice breakfast buffet. Large room in great location."
"1939",4,"Bad: The room was a bit smelly. Good: The location is perfect to get to Disneyworld. Rooms are large and confortable. Staff was usefull and nice. Excellent breakfast."
"1940",5,"While not directly on the river walk, this hotel provides a driver named Joe that really enjoys his job of driving people to the river walk and other downtown locations. They also have a reception most night with snacks, beer, wine. Fantastic experience. You can tell this hotel is run by people that want to do a great job!"
"1941",5,"Our party of 4 adults and 1 child had plenty of space to spread out and be comfortable in the spacious 2-bedroom suite. Friendly, courteous staff. Excellent amenities, including executive putt-putt course, TV club room, 24-hr convenience shop, and business center. Good breakfast and complimentary internet was a plus. An all-around pleasant hotel stay."
"1942",5,"We had a wonderful weekend at the Blue Sands Motel! Not only did they welcome our two standard poodles with open arms, but they were flexible with our late arrival and did everything possible to make our stay amazing. We loved the room (Room 5), which was well-appointed and quiet. The bed--a California King--was top notch. My wife said she... More"
"1943",5,"Everyone was great. Very close to the Metro."
"1944",5,"This is a great hotel. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and courteous. Checking in and checking out was very simple without any wait time. The hotel room was spotless along with the lobby and other facilities. I highly recommend staying here."
"1945",5,"We had a great visit to MotorCity casino and Detroit in general. We were in town to see the Tigers and White Sox play, and the hotel shuttled us all around Detroit so that we didn't have to get in our car at all. They let us check in 3 hours early, the staff was super friendly and accommodating, and... More"

"1947",5,"Stayed here for the Steelers vs Colts game in December. The hotel staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous. Prior to booking I was worried about the location and how easy it would be to get to the stadium, but taking the T was extremely easy, safe, and clean. We were able to get back from the game in only... More"
"1948",5,"The service was friendly, helpful and outgoing. The room was clean and beds comfy. Walls a little on the thin side and no mini fridge was our only complaint along with an aggressive shower head. Yes I would return to this hotel. The food was good and the people who worked their were outstanding."
"1949",3,"First on all Sam the shuttle driver was great!!!!! I can not say enough about him. To get to the hotel, you must call for the shuttle to guarantee they will arrive at their schedule times or take a taxi which should cost you 5. We were burned upon arrival with a 10 fee while he stayed on his mobile phone. Turns out the hotel is a quick 3 to 4 minute ride. The hotel is definitely too far to walk and neighborhood between metro and hotel is a bit sketchy with the apartments but the hotel is in a descant and quiet area. The check in staff did not seem too friendly nor helpful when asked about surrounding area. Once we got to know Sam, everything became better. He made sure we got got to metro station which is very convenient on time and inquired when we would return. He was there waiting!!!! Hotel is doing some remodeling but does not effect your stay. Thanks again Sam!!!!!"
"1950",5,"The rooms are very nice. Large flatscreen TV, kitchen...more like a small apartment than a hotel room. Only bad thing was that it's not super close to restaurants or bars. Other than that though, it's a great deal for the price, and very close to the metro."
"1951",3,"My sister and I stayed only for one night. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast was appreciated because we had a 8:15am pick up to the airport, there wasn't anytime for us to go out for breakfast. The clerk called and reminded us of our pick up time"
"1952",3,"Ok for the price.. the bed was hard.. woke every morning. With a backache. The ""hot breakfast"" was a tub of bland mushing oatmeal."
"1953",4,"The building and rooms were great, as was the staff. The decor was beautiful. The location convenient. The only issue was some slight dirt in the bathroom (but I am picky!). I would totally stay here again.Thank you for filling our out survey. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay with us! We look forward to having the opportunity to serve you on your next visit to Wichita. Have a nice day!"
"1954",5,"We always stay at this hotel when visiting New Orleans. It is literally steps from some of the classic restaurants in New Orleans and close to Bourbon Street while still allowing for a good night's sleep. The staff was friendly and helpful without being overbearing. I recommend the larger rooms over the smaller ones, since the small rooms are really... More"
"1955",4,"Fun time and very relaxing. Breakfast was pretty good also."

"1958",4,"I picked this hotel due to the airport shuttle mostly. The hotel had exterior renovations underway that impacted parking but not the stay. Friendly staff at check in. Then I noticed the nice outdoor pool. Later (after dark) the pool was packed. Lots of people enjoying the area. Very lively. My room was typical Holiday Inn. Upgraded nicely. Just barely... More"
"1959",5,"You do not want to miss this gem! From the moment you enter the front door to the time you leave the experience is like none other in NOLA.

It was our pleasure to have you as our guests and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"1960",5,"Wonderful suite hotel in Flagstaff. Convenient, although not in town. This I see as a positive. Everything was clean and efficiently run. Room was simple but very adequate for our needs which were just two nights and would be fine for long-term stays, as well. Really, we were delighted with this hotel."
"1961",5,"We wanted to take a quiet moment to thank you and the staff at the Grande Colonial for an extraordinary stay. The staff was professional and attentive, the facility had old world charm with modern amenities and the food and drinks were a delight.Thank you, Jccwins.

"1965",4,"Amazing. Just 12 mins from the beach, donning, and other attractions. The breakfast was excellent!"
"1966",5,"The nicest attitude from the Manager to front desk and room assistance. The shuttle driver was pleasant and very helpful. Not only did he suggest places to eat, and take us to the place of our choice, it was the best Italian restaurant ever. He also made sure we saw the Memorial to the bombing victims both in daylight and after dark. Not to be missed!! Room was clean, fresh, completely stocked with amenities, and the bed was comfortable. I look forward to finding a reason to go back to Oklahoma City and the Knights Inn at Bricktown Hotel."
"1967",4,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are very nice. They have a kitchen that helps to save on eating out. They have a bedroom separate from the main living area. We would absolutely recommend this hotel and we will be back. Thank you for helping make this a very enjoyable... More"
"1968",4,"I like staying at Best Westerns because I can count on a clean room and the right accommodations. The reason I give this one four instead of five circles is because the room looked like it needed a little maintenance. But it was clean. They have a free breakfast included with your stay from 6 am to 10 am."
"1969",5,"Staff was excellent. Room was great and the atmosphere of the hotel was wonderful. As far as location - how can you go wrong a block off the beach"
"1970",3,"First of all, keep in mind that this is a budget hotel. The front desk was very nice and check in was an easy process. We had a nonsmoking room and I did not detect any lingering smells from smoke. I will say that the room seemed fairly clean, but housekeeping definitely does not pay attention to detail. We dropped... More"

The mosaic bathroom (with a gigantic shower), the inner lit wardrobe and an abundance of mirrors throughout the light and airy suite were all very much to my liking. The staff were friendly and the only gripe would be... More"
"1972",1,"This was the WORST hotel experience I have ever experienced in my 47 years walking the face of this Earth. The hotel room was egregiously small, the beds were sunken in the middle, the pillow cases, linens, bed spreads and blankets were all filthy, the room had the stench of heavy cigarette smoke, the front desk LIED to me about not having any other rooms available and, to top it off, they still charged my credit card for a two-night stay despite me not even staying 15 minutes. I told the front desk that I was not staying and found somewhere else to stay and they told me that I would not give a refund despite the horrible and horrific conditions mentioned above. Lousy customer service. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone except the police. And, I would only recommend it to the police in order for them to arrest and file charges against hotel staff for theft -- for charging my credit card when I did not even stay at the hotel."
"1973",5,"I would like to recognize Johnny's patience, professionalism, hospitality and assistance through out my stay here at the Hampton Inn.

"1975",5,"We stayed 4 nights and had a corner room. Its across the street from City Center and the Space Needle. Hop on the Monorail and you are downtown, a short walk to Pikes Place Market. Its hard to find nice rooms in Seattle for under 200 a night, which is what we paid, including taxes and parking. Oh, and did I say breakfast was included.Dear Gary S,Thank you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

"1977",4,"This Hampton was consistent with my other experiences at their properties, which is why I like staying there. The room was comfortable and well insulated from ambient noise, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the breakfast offered a decent variety of hot/cold items. The one exception was my disappointment with the condition of the bathroom, which had paint peeling on the ceiling, and a tub that was stained from age. It could use a refreshing, and detracted from an otherwise satisfying Hampton experience."
"1978",3,"Really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to just about anyone. Loved the old Victorian ambiance and decor. The location was prime for us - we walked everywhere. Downsides are parking - had to park in the Commons garage but pretty walk back as long as it's not raining or snowing. And I really got the impression that a more traditional American bfast would be served but it was more like what you get at a chain hotel."
"1979",3,"Our family of four stayed at this hotel for a night. The room had a king size bed w/ sofa bed. The room was small. the room was renovated recently but it didn't feel like it. The place was still under construction. Breakfast was very ordinary , Juice machine was not working and staff had hard time keeping up with the refilling food stuff that were being consumed by the hotel guests.Dear Sdtourist,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay, we do our best to execute exceptional customer service and we clearly did not during your stay. Please except our sincere apologies. We have put guidelines in to ensure we provide phenomenal service to all our guest. Thank you for the feedback and if your travels ever bring you back to Scripps, Poway we hope to serve you again."
"1980",1,"My wife and I would definitely not recommend this hotel. It was over priced, noisy, and not clean. The only accommodating person was the breakfast attendant. The rates go up a ridiculous amount during the week."
"1981",5,"Everything went very well. We requested early arrival and a first floor room. All requests were met. Personnel were friendly and most helpful."
"1982",3,"Was probably once a great place. Needs an overhaul. The rooms are large, but poorly air conditioned. The pool is indoor/outdoor, which is pretty neat. The spa tub is old and needs to be updated. There is plenty of truck parking for 18 wheelers."

"1992",4,"The hotel is older but it is clean and the staff were very friendly. We arrived late after travelling for many hours and they were friendly and quick to get us into a room. They kept the pool open an extra half hour so our daughter could swim, which was a huge bonus to an 11 year old."
"1993",1,"This room should have been advertised for 19. I can't believe I spent 80 on this place!

Each day we had to ask for something that should have been in our room, towels, shampoo etc. Our last night there, we stood in a long line to ask for the cups that were not replaced during housekeeping. I was given the address to Wal-mart to go and buy my own! During breakfast they ran out of spoons, cereal was eaten with a fork. I wish management would train and hire additional employees for better customer service!"
"2033",4,"Past reviews made me skeptical, however, I was quite satisfied with my stay. The staff, room, and service was friendly, clean and professional - and this was during spring break! I will stay here again on my next trip to the area."
"2034",3,"The room was very clean and newly remodeled. The staff was pleasant. The only problem we had was the doors do not fit right and the slamming of the doors on the 4th floor was extremely loud. We have stayed at a lot of Hampton Inns and never experienced this problem with the room exit door."
"2035",5,"The hotel is very clean, comfortable, in a great location and the staff was both nice and helpful to guests! The breakfast we plentiful, and thats not always the case! Best price hotel within a reasonable distance from the falls and other attractions."
"2036",5,"We chose this Best Western because it offered up to 3 weeks free parking with Park-sleep-fly. No other park-sleep-fly option comes close to the hospitality and comfort of this hotel. It is outstanding. The front desk manager was incredibly helpful and courteous and upgraded us to a suite. Upon the recommendation of the front desk staff, we enjoyed an excellent... More"

"2039",5,"We absolutely loved our stay in Aria Hotel. We were lucky enough to get a room on the 54th floor and although we weren't facing the strip, the view is still beyond amazing. Location is perfect and couldn't recommend enough."
"2040",1,"Right on the highway to Laredo,but rooms set back from road.rooms very overpriced for what you get and not to clean. There was evidence of cockroaches in the room and bed linen had seen better days, very old and grey. There was debris from some rooms lying outside the cabins which could be a trip hazard although the car park/yard... More"
"2041",1,"I called the manager Matt for two straight weeks and left multiple messages. He felt it was unnecessary to return any of phone calls so my stay was ruined. I would never stay here again."
"2042",4,"I stayed in the hotel for 5 nights in April for business. Location is convenient to the strip, shopping, and restaurants. Check-in was easy with online check-in. The lobby is beautiful. I had a great view of the strip from my room on the 35th floor. The room is spacious and operates from an iPad beside the bed. When I... More"
"2043",5,"My wife and I spent our first anniversary here and loved it! The staff was incredibly kind and everything was clean and more than comfortable! It was only 45 minutes from Asheville so we spend the day in the city then drove back up in the evening. Cozy and warm, this place was amazing!"
"2044",5,"I had a great experience at this hotel. Everybody is friendly and the rooms are very clean. I utilized the fitness center to help me maintain my work out regiment. Kendra was my favorite employee. I would definitely stay here again because of the ease of access in location and friendly customer service."
"2045",4,"Pleasant room with small bathroom and closet. Clean (air freshener a little strong at first) with comfortable beds. A/C worked fine. Fridge Microwave were useful. Staff friendly and helpful. All in all very good value stopover with easy access to the freeway."
"2046",5,"Good: great location breakfast"
"2047",4,"We were in Fostoria for a class reunion and stayed at this hotel. We had been there before and liked it. It is convenient and met all of our needs. The breakfast buffet was good. We did not make use of the other amenities. The bed was extremely comfortable."
"2048",5,"We stayed for one night on our way to Florida. The hotel is conveniently located off of 95 and there's many restaurants and gas stations nearby. Check in was very fast and the staff was very friendly. We had a king suite for the night that was very clean and spacious. The beds were very comfortable and clean. We were... More"
"2049",4,"Good: I liked that they offered a complimentary happy hour with appetizers and drinks."
"2050",5,"We had the best service from a best western I have EVER had. ALL employees were so nice and helpful. We were even able to do laundry here. Score us. We were traveling the New England states and just needed to do some laundry to continue with the trip. The prices were reasonable for laundry and they have soap and... More"
"2051",3,"I had requested a sofa bed in room when i made my reservation and was told it would be available, but was told it was unavailable when I checked in. Also not told that room keys also operated elevators."
"2052",1,"To be short: no wifi (it works only at front desk and pool, lol), no refrigerator, very old TV with bad reception, with non working remote. Very small room, actually too small for 2 beds, very old repainted furniture. Stay away !"
"2053",2,"Travelling all the way from Louisiana to New Hampshire with a friend and a 10 month old pup we needed a pet-friendly hotel. I will say the management is interested in our thoughts, as they did respond to my review, so they are trying. This is an OLD hotel with renovated interiors. That still smell like smoke when the room... More"
"2054",1,"We stayed there for only one night (thank goodness!) a couple of days ago.The reception staff, especially Kris, were good. However, that's where the good ended. The room was dingy and old - paint chipped, moldy smelling, etc. There was something stuck on the edge of the nightstand (pic). The TV remote was disgusting (pic) - I didn't want to... More"
"2055",3,"One window, opens to walkway, no cross ventilation. It's convenient and that's about it. Free breakfast, free snoring nose strips!"
"2056",3,"As other reviewers have noted, this is a hotel that had it heyday in years past but for the price it is still comfortable and will give you a good nights sleep. They offer a breakfast, but I did not take advantage of it. The room was clean, but looked its age. Dark wood and curtains made it seem smaller... More"
"2057",5,"I have stayed in this hotel twice in the last year. I had a great experience both times. The suites are very clean and the beds are very comfortable. We had a one bedroom suite that included a full kitchen, a comfy living room couch/pull out double bed, in addition to the king size bed in the bedroom. The suite... More"
"2058",5,"Good: The staff was really friendly and the free coffee was good. The location was excellent. The hotel's restaurant was quite good too."
"2059",5,"Good accessible location. Very comfortable beds. Good breakfast offering. Verrrrrry accommodating staff. Good exercise and technology facilities. Close proximity to PIE airport. All positive on any criteria that I use to evaluate a hotel, particularly including price. Also close to some excellent golf courses."
"2060",2,"My daughter and I checked in late after driving all day. The room we were originally set to be in was marked as not ready in the system, so we were assigned to a larger room. When we got into the room, overall, everything appeared to be clean. However, when we went to the bathroom to turn on the shower, we noticed that the shower/tub had not been cleaned (or if it had, it was not done well). There were several dark hairs still in the bathtub, as well as small stumbles from a man. This was quite disgusting and not what we wanted to deal with at the late hour. I did my best to wash out and wipe down the tub, but we quickly showered with our flip flops on and went to bed. In the morning, we woke up and checked out quickly because it just felt dirty in the room. I did let the clerk know about our room upon checkout, and she stated that she would let the head of cleaning know."
"2061",5,"Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast lady Sunday morning was more interested in talking to people then keeping bar filled and clean. She should be able to do both. I had a knee cart and she would see me trying to get around chairs and tables and just continued to talk to someone and did not help. I had surgery on my foot and needed a place with no stairs for few days. The room was comfortable, spacious and clean. I enjoyed the front porch to sit. Out during the day to get fresh air. Overall the stay was great. Would do it again just to get away for a couple days."
"2062",5,"Quiet location in an office park. 15 minutes to downtown Boston. Great location for touring the city."
"2063",4,"The exterior does not look super attractivebut very nice on the inside. The room was comfortable and had updated appliances. Loved that it is a pet friendly hotel that did not charge additional fees. Would highly recommend to others."
"2064",5,"This hotel puts Reading, PA back in the map. Great place to stay to celebrate, wedding, reunion, honeymoon, etc. Restaurant and Bar are excellent, breakfast is always scrumptious. The staff are very friendly, accomodating and knowledgeable. Lots of parking (garage).Thank you for the 5 star rating and review. We appreciate your comments. It was our pleasure having you as our guest."
"2065",4,"The hotel may look a little run down at night, but after seeing it during the day it looks fine. I would probably suggest getting a cabin rather than hotel room. We got one of their cabins that was right beside the river. It was very pretty and relaxing. The cabin was nice and I felt comfortable there. This motel... More"
"2066",4,"Front lobby area with beverages was almost always disheveled. Bar area too. Breakfast was disorganized. Food was good though. Pool was nice feature but there was an ant issue in there. There were multiple ants on me when I got up to my room. Mattress felt lumpy but we slept ok. Room was a comfortable size."
"2067",5,"Bad: I think there could be more options offered as breakfast (there were only bagels and donut like something, and fruits), but it was still enough. So it's not something I didn't like but something that can be improved. Good: This hotel was a great one! When we entered room, there was classical music coming from the stereos, which give us a very nice feeling to start with. The bathroom, the towels, the bed, everything was clean, organized. I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most."
"2068",4,"We had a great night here! Food at Fuego was awesome!!! Great patio dinning experience! Free cruise shuttle! It was our anniversary so they sent us a bottle wine and chocolate! Amazing! We did have a minor leaky roof, they moved us to new room, that room reaked if marijuana. But it was late and I didn't want to move... More"
"2069",4,"Carl was great. Carl was the concierge and he helped us with touring New Orleans. The rooftop was the best part of the hotel. It had a stylish bar and a view of the city that you only get from this hotel Thank you so much for taking the time to share this feedback about your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had an excellent stay. You are correct in stating how wonderful the view is from our Monkey Board Rooftop Bar and also about the job Carl does as our concierge. We appreciate having you stay with us and hope to have you back for another stay real soon.Best regards,"
"2070",4,"Bad: The room/bed were a little small and the room was quite gloomy, very little natural light and the lighting wasn't great. Would have also preferred tea/coffee in the room rather that the large stereo/DVD system but that's just personal preference. Good: Great location, and friendly staff. Nice bar."
"2071",4,"Open plaza design of this Marriott makes it unique. Since it was late Oct when we stayed, it was beginning to get cold, but we were in a room inside a doorway so we didn't have the colder weather right outside our door. We had our own car to drive to Old Town, but they do offer a shuttle to... More"
"2072",1,"My friend and I stayed here last Friday (2 July). First off, we were told the public facilities were unavailable due to work being done in the hall (wallpaper going up). We were assigned our room and it was 1 bed. So went back down and said it was supposed to be 2 beds. We were issued another room (318)... More"
"2073",4,"The staff was very helpful and even upgraded my room for free. They allow pets, they have hot free continental breakfast and the room was clean and comfortable. My only complaints was the noise of the other guest. You could clearly hear voices and televisions until late and there was a lot of people walking around outside the door of the room."
"2074",4,"The staff at the hotel were all so friendly and welcoming. Bed was extremely comfortable and the noise level was great, barely heard anyone in the hallways. The bathroom had some water damage in it and the room was a bit dated but, nothing terrible. Would definitely stay here again."
"2075",4,"Bad: Better return from the slots!!. Good: Bed excellent, pillows good, shower good with strong flow and hot. Very well maintained public spaces with lots of wood panelling. The piece of the Berlin Wall was quite interesting and all at a very good price."
"2076",3,"The hotel staff are super friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast is also very good. Apart from the usual cold fare, the hot part included scrambled egg, home fries, and one other item (bacon or sausage or biscuit/gravy) during our stay. But that's where the positives end. The hotel condition is pretty bad. Rooms, elevators and all other common areas need major renovation. Many small issues existed in our room to name a few - the faucet head was broken, the hooks in the bathroom were missing, the phone was not working, the in-room lighting was poor (probably the darkest hotel room in my experience and I travel a lot). Oh, I forgot to mention one other positive - the free shuttle van to nearby places including the metro station. All in all, it's a ok hotel if you are a student or in a tight budget. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
"2077",3,"The beds are horrible. The Keys only worked once. I had to walk to the desk each time I left the room to get my key scanned to work again. This was aggravating. The internet was not secure, so we did not use it."
"2078",5,"Good: Love the game room and bar !"
"2079",5,"Very large rooms, well decorated, large bathrooms. Public spaces are chic. Rooftop pool and restaurant are scenes and fun. Not too stuffy. Nicest upper end hotel in area. Definitely now my go to on West Side"
"2080",5,"Best place to stay in Seattle. All the staff are really friendly and helpful. Rooms are spotless. Beds to die for....Seriously didn't want to get up.

Wished we could have stayed longer.... More"

Most hotels were sold out in the area, so we were pleasantly surprised to find comfortable, clean, and hospitable accommodations. We loved the location, which was within a couple miles of Old Town San Diego. If we ever need to return, I... More"
"2083",2,"After finding the comforter was stained my husband asked the front desk for another blanket and they gave us one. It appeared that a lot of people actually live at the hotel."
"2084",4,"Ten minutes from Dares beach and 20 minutes from Chesapeake beach. The proximity to everything is second to none. The staff are amazing and they're very accommodating. The pool is small but it's useful and breakfast is your general high school breakfast. Only real negative is my sheets were stained. Regardless, I'd recommend this place."
"2085",2,"Bad: I really do not know how this hotel has an 8.3 rating. Room is not like the pictures. Very noisy cleanning staff. Parking is not included as the listing says. You have to pay additional fees at the hotel. Definetely, not going back. Good: The receptionist was friendly. You can get some coffe in the back."
"2086",4,"We drove down for a weekend getaway and to celebrate a special birthday. Our infant son accompanied us. The room was nice but the bathroom was fabulous. We appreciated the separate large shower from the tub and the private toilet. I wasn't as much of a fan of the closet being inside the bathroom as it was a trip to... More"

"2088",3,"Bad: The rooms are tiny, but expensive. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They seemed bored and not so welcoming to visitors. They didnt refill the coffee thermos for breakfast and didnt care to either. It was awkward. Good: The place is clean and centrally located. I enjoyed the music playing in the room upon arrival. Its been updated although its an old building."
"2089",1,"Stayed at this hotel with their package deal of renting a room and leaving your car in the parking lot for a price of 159.99 while you fly away. Car was broken into and they refuse to pay for the damages. No responsibility. do not stay here do not trust them.Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, the airport market has had a recent wave of car vandalism. With the help of police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we fortunately have been able to stop these car break-ins. We understand how frustrating this situation is and again would like to extend our apologies. We want you to know that we will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe."
"2090",5,"Good: Morning coffee was excellent and offered on every floor with some delicious pastries The bed and pillows were comfortable and the hotel was very clean. As a past Chicago resident and frequent visitor, I'd definitely stay here again."
"2091",5,"Free room on BW points, regular stopping hotel on trips tpo SW Missouri. I find Best Westerns the best value for the price and always use them if available for both business and personal travel. I have never had a bad experience in any Best Western in 23 years and a business traveler."
"2092",5,"Very nice hotel. Staff is courteous and helpful. Hot tub was great. Very clean room and lobby. Decent breakfast... Loved the pancake making machine. I want one! Push one button, then 2 minutes later out pops a fresh hot pancake."
"2093",5,"This is the second time I have stayed here. The rooms are large and we had two double beds in ours. I did not use the pool but there were people in it all the time. we had to call down for towels and an extra blanket."
"2094",5,"The Hampton Inn in Bow, NH, is a wonderful hotel. Friendly and competent staff, very clean rooms, a very good FREE hot breakfast, and the location is great--easy access to I-93 and I-89.

"2097",1,"I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Is this the type of name Marriott wants for itself Should I take my loyalty to a different brand Dear floydmcmillan2007,Good Day, Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of Towne place suites Anaheim, I am very sorry to learn that your experience with us during your visit was not up to your par . Rests assure that we are now working on the issue and trying our best to fix the problem and I would like to thank you upon bringing this matter to our attention.

"2103",4,"Overall I was satisfied with our stay. The only issue I had was the kitchen floor did not appear clean. I spoke to the front desk they apologized and sent a cleaning lady that took care of it immediately. Staff was extremely nice during our stay."
"2104",2,"Check in staff did not smile or greet me. She just looked at me when I walked up to the counter. Housekeeping lady had an attitude and was rude. Did not bring washcloths, towels, or extra pillow that I requested. No one answered the phone when I called several times. There was no micro fridge or microwave as I expected and thought they stated. No iron or ironing board and they required to hold my husbands ID in order to use an iron. I will never stay at this hotel again!!!!!"
"2105",5,"Overall stay was great. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The coffee was great! Typically I do not care for hotel coffee - it was probably the best hotel coffee I've had this side of Europe.Dear laylemsp, Thank you for your stay and a great review. We are glad you enjoyed our clean and comfortable room. Our staff are constantly undergoing training to provide 'Premier' guest service. Look forward to hosting you here again soon.

"2111",5,"I can't say enough about the Suncoast!! My brother lives in Las Vegas, so as far as the Strip - we have been there, done that. If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast."

The outlets were falling out of the walls. They obviously do not... More"
"2117",5,"Bad: Though I booked through Bookings.com, they had no record of my reservations nor could they find any. They compted us and our driver with free drinks until they got it straightened out. Fortunately they still had a double room. The manager bought dessert after our lovely bar light dinner as well!!. Good: We had a wonderful stay prior to an early morning flight to Geneva, Switzerland"
"2118",5,"Very nice breakfast with lots of choices, high quality offerings and comfortable seating"
"2119",5,"Stayed there with the kids (6 of us total). Room was spacious and pull out couch was wonderful. Nice kitchen type area with frig and sink. Would choose again."
"2120",3,"This is a decent motel The staff is very friendly the breakfast is quite sparse compared to some other places at similar prices. Since there is no place to eat it they don't mind you taking something back to the room which I recommend over standing there at the front desk. All motels in Sunnyvale are expensive compared to similar places elsewhere so we have to factor that in to the price. I have stayed twice recently. All the rooms are not equal. The first one on second floor was a bit nicer because of the layout. The one downstairs in the back was more convenient for luggage, but the room layout was weird and not as comfortable. The immediate location is not great in terms of walking (there is only a Denny's next door), but its 5 minutes from downtown if you have a car."
"2121",4,"Bad: The bed was very uncomfortable. Lumpy and too soft. Good: Central location. Easy check-in and out. Nice touches. Access to breakfast on each floor with a tray to use in your room-protein from hard boiled egg and yogurt, fresh baked goods, cereal (hot and cold). Fitness center had a variety of cardio equipment and weights."

"2126",5,"Amazing and wonderful! Clean!! Susan, at the front desk, went above and beyond to give us great accommodations on very short notice! We will be back! I Highly recommend! This is an updated hotel that gives a very good first impression when you walk in the door. The rooms don't disappoint. Very affordable too!"
"2127",1,"I've heard such great things about the Chelsea, but their Annex is a dump. It really is. My bathroom was filthy. Neither my bathroom light nor my entryway light worked- we just had to use lamps. The room smelled like smoke or a gross cleaning agent, I couldn't tell. The walls are paper thin- I could hear a casual conversation in the room adjacent to ours. Even the elevator had 3 holes in its walls! Great location to Tropicana, but we won't stay there again."
"2128",5,"This Hotel exceeded every need we had. We were expecting mediocre at best and everything was 5 Star. Room was exceedingly clean. Room was quiet. Breakfast was unbelievable. Check in and Check out were a breeze!"
"2129",5,"Our hotel staff recommended we check it out for the view and brew and we just loved it! Such a cool idea to re-use a character filled building! There's a little something for everyone there...we checked out a new movie for only 3 and enjoyed drinks and food while relaxing in comfy couches. Prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere...

"2130",1,"There was a restaurant charge on my invoice for 139.00 and I contacted the front desk to notify them that I did not eat at their restaurant, charge a meal to my room or order room service so obviously someone used by credit card info on file to charge a meal. The person working the front desk was dismissive and rude and just said We'll look it to it. I told him that was not good enough I wanted to know if my charge info and identity was compromised so I could notify my bank. I'll cut to chase he was no help. I asked to speak to a manage but I was told there was not manager on duty so two hours later I finally spoke to a manager Jim who told me the charges would be reversed in 3 days...I still don't know if my personal info has been compromised and I have to monitor my account everyday and the charges have still not been reversed. Terrible customer service. Bob"
"2131",5,"My boyfriend and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary this past weekend. The hotel lobby was beautiful, clean and have a very welcoming vibe. The staff was extremely pleasant! Our room was clean, super cute and cozy. We had an adjoining room so we could hear the guest next door from time to time but it was not a bother what so ever. Overall our local get away was a much needed break from real life and this hotel provided the perfect space to relax, feel comfortable and enjoy the weekend."
"2132",3,"The beds are warm fluffy and so comfortable. The room is a basic empty trash make bed type clean. Lots of dust on office furniture chair curtains, etc. No free coffee no cookies - but parking has a daily fee even for overnight guests. Bell staff are fast courteous as well as Front Desk. However, the housekeeping staff... More"
"2133",5,"Not much to look at from outside but does that really matter The inside was spotless and the beds were comfortable. The owner was very accommodating and the rest of the staff very friendly. They have a nice laundry area with four washers, four dryers, vending machines and a coffee machine. Would not hesitate to stay here again!"
"2134",3,"Perfect location for employee during job."
"2135",3,"We stayed at this hotel in August, it is in the center of Silverton and walking distance to everything you need. The hotel is historic and the rooms have been renovated, but still keep the historic charm. The bedding is comfortable, the bathrooms are basic with basic towels etc. There isn't any air conditioning and if you get a room... More"
"2136",5,"Nice, clean, comfortable and affordable, all with a great hot breakfast and close to GMU. Wish they had an outdoor pool, but much better than local competitors."
"2137",5,"Bad: the noise fm the live bands when trying to sleep."
"2138",4,"This was our first trip to Savannah and only had 2 days to explore the city. On our arrival, Christopher, at the front desk was super helpful. I mentioned our son would be arriving separately and where could he park ( cheaply). While checking in my son called me and had arrived, Christopher came outside and helped him find a... More"

"2140",1,"The towels were stained. The comforter had burn holes in it. The tub grips were starting to turn black. And there were bugs in the bed. My sister and I ended up sleeping on top of the covers because it was a holiday weekend and nowhere else had vacancies."
"2141",3,"Stayed here with my wife and kids while passing through Wyoming. It used to be a Super 8 that was pretty run down, but has now converted to a Comfort Inn and gone major renovations. Right next door is Applebees so we were able to quickly eat dinner without even having to go hunt for a place. Great place for... More"
"2142",5,"Bad: Timing seemed to be off. Had to wait a very long time for breakfast, longer than people who had come in after us. Had to wait a very long time for the valet to bring our car, seemed to be some kind of communication issue. They were nice about it, and so were we, but it seemed to be a theme, which was a bit of a disappointment. Good: Nicely appointed room, great location."
"2143",5,"Rm 314 was great! I chose this room because of the oversized clawfoot tub. It would be great for a longer stay since it's basically a one bedroom appartment with a full kitchen, 4 seat dining table and separate living room. There is no view from this room but who cares! I had a romantic weekend planned and time out... More"

"2151",4,"The kind of real coffee house which is surprisingly rare in the US. A cheery barista who clearly knew her business. Excellent capucinnos and lattes, and muffins. From the number of locals who came in this looks the place in Silverton for good coffee."
"2152",5,"Always enjoy stay at Hampton. Kind, professional service. Hot , healthy breakfast, and comfortable rooms. Beds are very comfortable. Cookie fruit, coffee, and tea snacks in the evening. Safe environment."
"2153",4,"We stayed here for one night while attending a Braves game. The room was clean, bed was very comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was great having easy access to 285, restaurants/shops close by and the MARTA station is just a short drive away. We will defiantly stay here again."
"2154",3,"Very friendly staff. Decent clean room and bed, Slept well on motel was quiet Close to interstate, restaurants and shopping. Breakfast was a mediocre continental. A very reasonable price. Overall this was a good value"
"2155",5,"This was an excellent hotel. Very clean and updated. Nice comfortable beds and covers. The complimentary breakfast had a huge selection and something for everyone. The only draw back was it was on the expensive side, but I guess you get what you pay for because I can't think of anything to complain about. Lol."
"2156",5,"The front staff as awesome and accommodating, the room they put my family in was perfect. I would definitely recommend to friends and family and return. Very close to everything. They also have bbq grills where you can bring your own food and use. Great time."
"2157",5,"Nothing to complain about. Very friendly staff and loved it! Diana and Taylor were very helpful. Breakfast was great. Bacon, eggs, hasbrowns, waffles! It was a wonderful experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!"
"2158",4,"We had a nice time. Pool could have been a little warmer but my granddaughter love it.

"2159",5,"Bad: When we left there was a valet parking worker that made us put are luggage on the cart. But other than we had an awsome time there. Good: The location and the restaurants were great I enjoyed the buffet!"
"2160",3,"Bad: Walls are very thin - we could hear upstairs and next door neighbors. The breakfast was very basic. Good: The location was great. Easy access to T. Nice bathroom."
"2161",3,"I found the hotel very nice. The rooms were clean, the hallways were clean and there was not a lot of noise. The beach is 'yucky', but the pool, the gym and the jacuzzi were very nice. If you eat at the TradeWinds restaurant, don't order the crab cakes. I'm still trying to decide what they tasted like. It certainly was not like a crab cake. Unfortunately, the hotel lost a customer for meals for the next 3 days, as we did not want to chance another food diaster."
"2162",2,"A little hard to get to, nothing in the immediate area - like within walking distance. A little old and outdated looking."
"2163",5,"This year I went myself, over a blustery weekend in late June. In the past, we had stayed here many times. Outstanding view. Rooms are always in tip-top shape the same for all common spaces and grounds. Friendly, accommodating staff. A wonderful breakfast room, as well. You can count on the Atlantis."
"2164",5,"We arrived at the hotel a few days after a devastating thunderstorm had knocked out power to a large portion of DC, MD, VA. The hotel had opened up to refugees that had no power so they did not have a room with 2 double beds as we had ordered. They gave us a room with a king bed and a rollaway bed. It was cramped for 4 of us. But the hotel staff was indeed marvelous and went out of their way to make our stay at DC a very good experience. Excellent location with metro and a great shopping mall on site. Lots of fabulous restaurants within a short walk. My kids loved the hotel and their indoor pool. We will stay there again the next time we visit DC."
"2165",4,"The rooms are comfortable and affordable, but for some reason my account is always screwed up after a stay. I had four charges on my card for some reason. Other than that our stay is always enjoyable."
"2166",5,"We were absolutely treated as you would expect...very high end experience with all the right amenities.

"2175",4,"Very nicely decorated in retro fashion. Loved the steamer versus the traditional iron.Very friendly and accommodating staff.Although location is within walking distance to the French Quarter, would not recommend walking late at night. We found ourselves a bit turnaround when walking back from French Quarter. We stopped in at the Emergency Department of Tulane Hospital for directions who advised us that it was not safe to be walking in this area. They called us a cab despite the fare being very short (a few blocks). Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. The comments of our guests are important for others to get a feel of our property and location. Sorry to hear you got turned around, be sure to let our concierge assist you with a map on your next visit.WayneGeneral Manager"

"2178",4,"Bad: Walls are very thin, be prepared to hear your neighbors."
"2179",5,"It may look a bit dated as seen from the road and most of the the rooms we have stayed in are on the small side, but the utilization of space and attention to detail is amazing. Breakfast is the basic typical fare, very relaxed in the bright cheerful lobby area."
"2180",3,"The front desk staff was not good. Tried to leave a wakeup call two nights in a row. Went down to the front desk about 9 pm could not find anyone. Checked out at 4:30 am no one at desk or available."

"2185",3,"This is a low cost, low amenity place in rougher area - passable for a night or two. Wi-Fi was OK in room, but not secure. Free breakfast was good with hot and cold choices. Elevators - 1 not working long term, other was barely working, and was vvvvvveeeeerrrrrrrryyyyyyyy ssssslllllooooowwwww. Working one always went down to basement before coming up to first floor to take guests up their rooms ssssslllllooooowwwwwlllllyyyyy. Elevators need replacement - in really bad shape. Too small and buttons don't work. Bldg exterior, pool area need some investment. Lobby, breakfast area in OK shape. The hallways smell like smoke - seems like a roadway motor lodge out of the 70's. Who smokes anymore The rooms are fairly beat up, small beds, small no frill bath, no water pressure. Did have med size fridge and microwave tho."

"2190",5,"Good: Delightfully smoke free! No casino, so much quieter than regular Las Vegas hotels. Just behind The Flamingo, so short walk to monorail, Paris or the strip. The concierge, Spencer, was very helpful in getting back to the motel quickly after our show."
"2191",1,"I generally use lowest cost accommodations, so often use Motel 6. They tend to range from OK to a great deal. This one is absolutely the WORST one I have ever used.

"2204",4,"Great value and location, Club Quarters is walking distance to Main Street nightlife and half the price of nearby hotels. Valet parking is reasonably priced, property was clean and comfortable, and staff is very friendly. Will definitely stay here again!"
"2205",4,"Nice menu of american cuisine. Steaks, pasta, salads, chicken. Rueben and sweet potato fries were very good. Onion rings a little greasy. Chile very good. Nice crowd with families. Recommended. We will probably stop again."

"2207",3,"We had two nights this month at the Envoy. Upon arrival we were not happy with front desk staff attitude, followed by getting a smoking room despite having booked non-smoking. On return to the desk they could only get us two doubles non-smoking although we were there 15 mins past 3pm and I am a Gold Elite BW member.Parking was good, secure and very handy.Later in the stay we experienced more rude front desk, and saw other guests experience it too.The remainder of hotel staff seemed friendly but spoke little English.Breakfast (included) was fine but they only would put out so much.... even though they had reserves and therefore one had to go very early if one wanted any choice.Location was fine - a block of the boardwalk - but nighttime ventures out showed the neighbourhood to be somewhat rough on the road to bettering maybeAC was ok which was good because it was hot!"
"2208",5,"Bad: Our AC was not working but they provided us with a portable fan, which helped. It was nice they provided water and snack bar was stocked with a variety of things. Good: Central to lots of sites and walking around is convenient"

Decades ago. How did this get on Priceline I have stayed at more than 40 hotels in Chicago on Priceline over the years, but this is the first time I have stayed in a hostel. A hostile. Really I wish zero stars was a choice, but that would be too many. I know all the hipster comments I will get on this, but please, keep them to yourself.Hello Steve P, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I so sorry that your stay was disappointing due to the room layout not being as expected for our star rating.

"2231",1,"We arrived in town at 10am, and asked if we could check in early. We realized we were very early, but hoped we could check in before 3pm. We were told we could not check in early, even though the place was almost a ghost town (there were 3 cars in the parking lot (including ours), and I wondered if the other two belonged to the workers. When we came back at 4:30pm to check in, we were told we would need to get a second room as we had 2 teenagers (plus mom dad) and 3 toddlers. We asked if our toddlers could sleep in a pack n play or on the floor. They said no, so we asked for a refund, so we could make arrangements to stay somewhere that would be more accommodating. They refused to give us a refund, and called the cops. The cops arrived a few minutes later. After hearing both sides, the cops asked the hotel to give us a refund, but the hotel refused. After an hour and fifteen minutes, we agreed to stay there for that night and find another hotel for the next night, but still no refund was provided. To top it off, the hotel was terribly dirty and run down. The pool area needs to be painted as you can see the concrete all over. The room was dirty. This was our worst hotel experience ever."

"2239",5,"Comfortable and clean rooms with a friendly staff. The hotel was very quiet - I heard very little noise from other guests. The amenities included complimentary bottled water near the elevators and snacks in the 2nd floor business center. The hotel's location is excellent and right on the river. I would stay there again without hesitation.Hello nchat1,Thank you for the kind words regarding your experience. We work hard to ensure our guests are happy and it clearly paid off! We look forward to having you back with us next time you come to Chicago!"
"2240",4,"My stay here was pretty cool for the 1st time. This was my 1st time getting a hotel by myself and the experience was cool and relaxing. At 1st I was hesitant about getting a hotel here because of the rating but good thing I decided to check it out for myself. The only few thing was that the bathroom fan is loud and the actual unit only blew out cold air. But other than that it was very relaxing."

"2247",5,"This Hyatt is a great place. Clean, quiet, friendly staff, nice bar, great happy hour, well located and responsive to your needs. We will stay here again without a doubt. It was a little noisy from other patrons slamming fire doors. That was not the hotel's fault. That came from people with no social graces."
"2248",5,"This hotel superseded my expections. Rooms were gorgeous and hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating! Great location that I could walk to everything!"
"2249",4,"We have come to this hotel yearly for 23 years. It's convenient, friendly and has above average amenities. We recommend it especially for families.

I would agree if the scale was out of 100, not 5. One of the two queen beds had the mattress springs bulging through surface. The bathroom was dirty and I killed 3 roaches."
"2281",1,"Everything went well till about 130 am when we were woke from a peaceful sleep of someone trying to enter our room. I went to the door to find another couple who told me we were in their room. Apparently the front desk booked our room twice. We never were able to get back to sleep which was a major problem as I was there for surgery the next morning at John Hopkins. My wife was given a free breakfast ( I was unable to eat due to the surgery) and we were told we would receive a free voucher for a free night in the the future in the mail. As of the writing of this we still have not received anything that was promised. This hotel was the BWI Hilton."

"2284",2,"This is a pet friendly hotel. Having said that, it smells like a pet friendly hotel that does not get a thorough cleaning after a dog has been sick. We were booked into our first room which smelled like a mixture of beef jerky and vomit. Our second room was a little better, but we still had to go buy several candles to make the room habitable. The carpet was sticky, and the sheets were full of holes. The bathtub looked like someone took a blowtorch to a corner. The carpet in the halls is in a severe need of cleaning. Many spots and traffic patterns. The breakfast was good if you like lots of carbs. I came away feeling gross and dirty even after a shower."

Made me wonder how often they made the biscuits. Friday they were good, by Monday they were very very stale. The scrambled eggs were good on Friday through Sunday. Monday They tasted different and weren't as good. I ended up having to throw mine away and eating a muffin instead."
"2288",5,"Clean comfortable hotel. Dennis the shuttle driver provided a tour into Newport and back to the hotel that was better than paid tours in Boston and Manhattan we have been on. He was the highlight of our trip. We are frequent visitors to Newport but never knew the history. We learned the different neighborhoods and restaurant choices other than harbor side. Breakfast on his recommendation was great! The free breakfast at Hampton is not why we stay there. The cleanliness and security is the most important feature to us. Someone needs to recognize Dennis for his efforts!! We will be back because of this A1 service.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel with the TripAdvisor community. We appreciate your kind words and compliments regarding the cleanliness, comfort and security of our location.

I would recommend this property to anyone wanting to check out downtown Chattanooga. The only downside was the parking garage, it was a little inconvenient when carrying luggage."
"2305",4,"Hotel was wonderful. Location, staff, amenities, cleanliness were great. Loved the choice of pools. Two small issues:. Shower needs a grab bar to help older and/or mobility challenged guests in and out. A!so, the discounted rate was clearly reflected in our room location. Less than pleasant view, near hotel HVAC equipment which burped and gurgled 24/7, and door to room 5 steps from ice and vending machines."

Not much around the hotel but we had supper at the Red Coach Inn which was just around the corner. Meal was great."
"2320",2,"I will never stay here again and its a shame because the facility and location were very nice. I booked and paid in full via Hotels.com. When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay. After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay. On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance. I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in. After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning. The rooms were nice and location was fantastic but its a shame the desk staff doesn't have a clue, I will not be returning to this chain and also will push my friends and family to avoid it as well."

"2327",4,"Bad: We had a deluxe double room which can accommodate up to 4 persons. We had three adults. The bed was a bit small for 2 persons and we couldn't add one more bed because of fire restriction. Good: I like the clean and simple design of the room.

"2335",2,"For the rate of 200, it would've at least been nice to get a complimentary bottle of water with the room. There's a hampton inn down the road that is just as 'nice', would rate as average, and provides a breakfast with the rate. I guess if you're getting reimbursed for expenses, then your rating would be higher.I am sorry to hear your stay with us did not quite meet your expectations. However, we do appreciate your feedback and thank you for sharing your experience on Trip Advisor.Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor"
"2336",5,"Bad: Little storage space in the room small bath. But I knew that when we booked the room from other reviews, so it was as expected especially in boutique hotel. No complaints. Good: Nicely decorated boutique hotel just a couple of blocks south of the crazy South Beach scene. Several upscale restaurants a short walk away down the quiet side of South Beach. Enjoyed complimentary breakfast on the porch. Comfortable bed with nice pillows."
"2337",4,"Bad: Room is on the small side. I was on one of the back rooms. There are no views and other buildings can see inside your room since windows are high. Breakfast is not attended and no hot option. Very narrow corridors. Good: The decor of the room is very modern and pleasing with sound equipment for those that want to listen to music with speakers on the wall. Floor of shower is non-slippery. Decor of the bathroom is also very nice. Location is outstanding with Copley subway station accross the street as well as bus stop. Restuarants and shops in Newbury Street one block away. Bagels and donuts in breakfast were fresh."

"2339",3,"It's a standard Embassy Suites, just super overpriced. Staff is friendly. Saw a roach at breakfast. And overall, breakfast is pretty basic/tasteless. Good location - shuttles to reagan and pentagon city metro. No shuttles to IAD. Considering there are so many other similarly priced places in the area - no loyalty to return here. Not a very distinguishing experience either way - Standard big corporate hotel experience."
"2340",5,"Very comfortable room. Our son came and they had a couch that they pulled out into a queen size bed. Free wifi and bottled water. This hotel was built back in the 20's and the decor is fabulous. A very neat hotel."
"2341",1,"Arrived to discover an outrageous parking fee (also did not offer any disabled veteran discounts). Check in was ok until we discovered the entire college football team was arriving that night. The room was ok, the thermostat did not work so the room was very warm. It wasn't until later that night that the football enthusiastic kicked in and needless to say, we managed about two hours of sleep. You would figure the hotel would have informed us of this when we booked the room or at least would have had the decency to tell the rude guest to hold the noise down since it was after midnight. Needless to say I could not recommend this hotel to anyone else."
"2342",5,"In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoy staying here, and we deeply appreciate your loyalty. We will share your kind words with Jie, and look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmest Regards, Daniela CataldoDirector of Rooms"

I required special handicap accommodations, so I called the hotel directly to be sure that a couple of things could be prearranged for my room. I asked... More"
"2344",5,"The Comfort Suite in chincoteague, VA had a sumptuous breakfast, with hot and cold choices, even fresh waffles daily. The room was large and comfortable, the housekeeping staff very on top of their work, and the front desk accomodating and available. The location is perfect - near enough to walk to the shops, near enough to Assateague for a quick beach drive. Lovely for children."
"2345",5,"Great stay love the see through shower. My reservation was confirmed but not booked. I was booked extremely fast. The service was fast and very friendly. All smiles. I enjoyed playing pool. The decor is fabulous and sheik"
"2346",4,"Simple hotel, good stay. Easy access to gas station, food and dessert places. Rooms are nice, no huge complaints, had a small issue with hot water/shower but the hotel addressed and solved the issue quickly."
"2347",5,"It was perfect for my travel needs for work. Hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly. If you stay here you have to eat at the Greene Turtle, it's a 1/4 of a mile away with great food."
"2348",3,"Very busy, efficient-enough airport location. Rooms quite OK.. housekeeping fine.. but hotel is getting run down. Some modern era touches lacking, i.e., not enough power outlets near desk or bed. Staff tries hard to accommodate guests. Irksome and preposterous 50/night 'incidentals' charge which is returned post-stay."
"2349",5,"we loved this hotel would recommend to any travelers coming to area. the rooms are large and comfortable. the hotel is close to hiway. the staff treat you well. the pool is indoors and warm. breakfast is good."

"2356",5,"We experienced a comfortable, welcoming, restful stay and enjoyed breakfast in the morning. I appreciated the cleanliness of our room, the interactions the whole family had with the staff and the choices and presentation of the food at breakfast."
"2357",3,"The hotel staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean. The location is horrible as there isn't anything close in the way of stores or restaurants. If you arrive late you will have extremely limited access for dinning except for the over priced microwave food at the front desk. Breakfast and cocktail hour are a nice touch, but both need to be extended by an hour."
"2358",5,"I was very pleased with this hotel. will certainly stay here again. very convenient location to USC and the Staples Center in a nice hotel with exorbitant costs. free shuttle and parking a huge plus in this area. neighborhood is not amazing but where is in LA I didn't think neighborhood was as bad as many guests."
"2359",4,"Bad: We felt that the hotel was overpriced for the amount we paid. Neither my wife nor I felt that it was worth 265 a night. We make it a point to stay at Hilton properties whenever possible, and this was our first visit to a Hilton Garden Inn it will probably be our last. While the property was nice, it was not what I expected for the price. We get a better value from Hampton Inns. Good: Our room was well appointed and comfortable. As I have come to expect from Hilton properties overall, the hotel was nice."

"2362",3,"Hotel definitely needs updating. Worn carpet everywhere filthy evelator doors. Staff is rude not pleasant at all except nice ladies that work in the restaurant. The shuttle experience was the worst I ever experienced! Driver (the one who walks with a limp) never greeted anyone was never on time."
"2363",5,"The Dana is a vast property with tremendous views of mission bay. Located right on the bay front with excellent water views. Watersports on site. 2 big pools and 2 hot tubs. They have kids movies in the swimming pool area on certain nights. Cons: - Small bathroom / toilet - Small sink - tiny and located outside the bathroom."
"2364",5,"Nicely situated in downtown Silver Spring within walking distance of the revitalized shopping/restaurant district. We seemed locked in to the Valet Parking which was not terrible at 15 for a weekend day. Our 6th-floor ice maker was not working so we had to get ice from one of the other floors...not a big deal, either."
"2365",5,"I coordinated a group of 23 visiting Napa during the grape harvest in October, and we booked the entire group into the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines. First, let me say if youre a snob and really into posh places with fancy marble lobby floors, fluffy robes on the hook, perky concierge behind a big desk, etc. this may not be for you. But if you like to get real value, service and comfortable accommodations for a modest price, you cannot beat the Inn at the Vines. It is family owned and operated (several generations), and the service and sense of community are notable in this day and age. The place has been updated and has all the features you need..clean well furnished rooms, flat screens, very comfortable beds (we had king bed rooms), great towels, and organic soaps. To some earlier reviews about highway noise: we found it minimal and no one in our group complained. Yes, I did hear the occasional truck early in the morning or California kid with a Flowmaster exhaust doing a jack-rabbit start from the intersectionagain it was not a problem. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Front Desk Manager Shanirra did an exceptional job booking our customized winery tour, restaurant reservations, and balloon rides. As our person on the ground in Napa she was in our corner every step of the way and played a large part of a successful three days in Napa! At the front desk Melody, Shawn and Bertha were always helpful, upbeat and service-minded. Complimentary hotel breakfasts are a joke at many hotels.not so at the Inn at the Vines. There is a Dennys on the property, and you get a legitimate complimentary hot breakfast at the restaurant not some dinky room off the lobby. Try eggs any way you want, bacon/sausage and pancakes/toast and coffee. You cant beat it unless you must have Eggs Benedict and mimosas. The owners are continuously making improvements to keep up with newer hotels. During out stay a fitness center and business center were under construction. Botom line: when visiting Napa in the future I will stay at the Inn at the Vines again. Our entire group was pleased.Ed,it was a pleasure meeting you and hosting your group for your stay in the Napa Valley. I enjoyed hearing your story of what happened at the Castle. Yes, Shanirra is a great employee who is always the first to try out new restaurants and tours. All of our employees keep up to date on all there is to do in the Valley. We are family run (4th generation), and as you saw, we take pride in our Hotel. I am glad your group enjoyed their stay and maybe we can make this an annual event."
"2366",5,"Good: The continental breakfast didn't disappoint. Staff were friendly and the location was perfect!"
"2367",3,"Average stay, average hotel, nothing much to say. Most memorable part of stay was a maintenance man who was very friendly and went out of his way to be friendly and helpful. Otherwise, everyone else seemed to just be doing a job."
"2368",1,"We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the 1st weekend in Jan.We never have issues but when it rains it pours with this group...We checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a re-rate. They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect. We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium."

"2378",3,"The hotel caters to pets, and that's fine when you need it. The room was dirty (expected since there are so many animals involved). I would not stay there when I'm not traveling with a pet. Bathroom was okay typical for a hotel in this price range."

"2380",4,"Bad: Outside street noises were loud during the late night. Motorcycles racing and taxis honking woke us up. Might have been better with a room not facing Stuart Street. Good: Staff was friendly and helpful! Nice room."
"2381",4,"We spent 3 nights at the Four Points. It was well worth the money. Very convenient to the metro which we took the 2 full days that we went into Washington D.C. The hotel will take you and pick you up from the metro with their shuttle. The neighborhood is not the greatest, but I felt safe. There are several surrounding business like an Ihop, pizza place, and 7-11. A New Carrollton officer sat in the 7-11 parking lot 2 of the nights we were there. I would definitely recommended Four Points."

"2390",2,"In addition to having to ask to be moved three times after seeing the initial condition of the room I was assigned (something I have never done in nearly 100 hotels I have stayed at), they carpet was so dirty I refused to take off my socks, the nightstand had a sticky substance on the surface and in the drawers, the furniture was old, worn and dirty, the staff was not terribly helpful and the neighborhood is in an economically depressed area and I did not feel completely safe at night being a single woman travelling alone. There are multiple signs in the parking lot warning that the hotel is not responsible for any damage or theft and I was worried about my car being broken into. Only pros- just off the highway and one of the nicest hotel gyms I've ever seen. Even so, I will NEVER stay here again! If I hadn't already paid in advance through hotels.com, I would have left immediately."
"2391",5,"As said in the title, I don't have a single negative thing to say about this hotel. Every member of the staff was as nice as can possibly be, rooms are nice housekeeping does a great job, and the complimentary breakfast AND dinner were delicious. Not to mention the complimentary dinner includes (3) drinks. Great location right by the airport easy in easy out, and there are some great restaurants within walking distance."

"2394",2,"We have traveled to all areas of the US and realize high tourist areas such as this are normally higher priced lodging. However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!Dear Don G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so we can better serve our Guests. Reading through your review I see the we fell short of your expectations. I apologize for the service that was provided. I will be sharing your comments with my staff, so that we can learn fro our short falls.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"
"2395",5,"Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu."
"2396",5,"Absolutely LOVED this hotel. Truly the best service, food and location. Classy and polite staff. Our banquet food was delicious and always fresh throughout the day. Staff would whisk away all dishes and place settings when we were finished and my glass or cup was never empty. Accommodations were great. Big beds, big rooms, big bathrooms and an amazing 360...

"2397",5,"I had a room on the 9th floor. Supposed to be a small room but in reality was very adequate with a king size bed. Comfortable, and total paid on booking.com was 88! I was walking distance to the Southshore train which I used to travel from Michigan City, Indiana. I arrived early, 10:45am, and I had planned to ask them to just hold my overnight bag, but they said my room was ready so I was checked in by 11 am! Wow! Every staff member was very helpful, and I enjoyed dinner at the Elephant and Castle restaurant affiliated with the hotel. Excellent food and beverage."
"2398",2,"The room was extremely outdated and had a musty odor. The parking was not the best."
"2399",5,"My wife fell in love with this resort the moment she entered the room. The view was gorgeous and the resort was kid friendly. The kitchen was nice and clean so was the laundry room. We wished we could stay longer than we planed."

"2412",3,"I have stayed here a few times and most recently this week. Their deluxe rooms are sub par, the ones with the golf view are somewhat better and worth the money. The Mediterranean two bedroom suite is a great value and the Presidential was a swing and a miss for us. All of the rooms are spacious, but the bedding in the deluxe rooms was uncomfortable. We never stayed in the one bedroom suite, but Med suite is very large with ample common space and generous sized bedrooms. The bathrooms are green granite which gives a nice feel to the room. We most recently stayed in a Presidential suite (one of four in the hotel) room 960. We were booked in the Med. suite, but decided to accept the up-sell upgrade and pay the extra 124 per night to check it out. While it is about 1,000 sq ft larger than the Med. the huge common area was wasted on the two of us. The two bedrooms were a bit larger with the king master offering a beautiful panoramic view of the golf course from the bathroom. The rest of the room has sweeping views of the mountains, once you get past the immediate view of the top of the parking garage. The master shower has a shower panel that looks to offer a variety of body jets with a shower head. The thing was awful with the only two options being the waterfall and shower head or just the waterfall. The first night the water barely got hot enough to take a shower. I reported the problems and they fixed the water temp but not the panel. The water in LV is very hard and this panel also had the classic green deposits that come from the water. You would think they could afford some CLR to clean the unitWhile I am on the soapbox, I must comment about their toiletries. The shower/bath soap was a tiny little white bar in a cheap cardboard box. The shampoo and conditioner were equally cheap, but the kicker was the hand/face soap. It was a little round disc in a plastic package. When I opened it to use it, I thought it was a recycled soap piece! It had no lather and was just crap. If anyone from the property reads this, you really need to re-think these products as they scream CHEAP. The rest of the facility is a midstream casino/resort experience. Granted, you are not on the Strip, but there are nicer neighborhood properties in the area. The newly added The Game sports bar and Subway are decent. The Deli. offers a great value for your money albeit with a limited menu. There is also a movie theater and a variety of other restaurants that we didn't try. The pool appears to be small for the property, so investigate it further if you plan to spend much of your stay at it. The staff are all very friendly and there is ample and easy parking. Overall, not a bad place, but just OK.Thank you for posting your comments on your recent stay. I have sent your comments to our Facilities and Housekeeping teams to address. I hope the next time you stay you will take the time to enjoy all the amenities our property has to offer. Have a nice day."
"2413",5,"Spent my honeymoon here, well one week of it. What a great place. Very much like a condo, they have barbq for you to use The restaurant, The Duke, is really good, but a bit pricey. Rooms are big and well worth the money."
"2414",5,"Really great hotel, good breakfast buffet and I loved the fact they had a stairway going down to the beach area... And the view of the Ocean was fantastic. The only unfortunate thing was the weather wasn't in our favor to enjoy the hot tub and fire pits. I'll be back"
"2415",1,"This place is a dump. The rooms are not clean. The beds are smaller than a normal double bed. The sheets and blankets have cigarette burns in them. The mattress in my room had been torn open with the springs exposed. The rooms all have terrible perfume smell. Only a few channels on the TV work, some don't have sound. The ice machine was full of mold. The overall area that the hotel is in a bad place. When the police are constantly outside in the parking lot it's a sign not to stay there."
"2416",4,"Everything was fine for a per-cruise hotel. There were a couple of places nearby to eat (Miller's Ale house I believe) and the hotel I think arranges for transport to the cruise ships. They do have pick up from the airport but for us it was a 45 minute wait and they are only 10 - 15 minutes away. When... More"

"2420",5,"Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely, Octavia Marginean"
"2421",5,"If you are on business or just passing through, GM Sam Patel runs a very efficient small hotel. Great staff and exceptional clean and comfy rooms. nice bar for a great Happy Hour with beer and wine specials. Nothing too much trouble for the staff, highly recommend this hotel"
"2422",4,"Great hotel nothing spectacular, the price is right, but the location was awesome. Right in the middle walking distance from everything!!"
"2423",4,"when i saw the neighborhood i wasn't exactly sure. there are some brand new places/hotels nearby, but there are also some very run down places nearby also. all worked out very well for our stay however and everyone at the hotel was nice, the place was clean, and despite appearances there wasn't any trouble and we felt safe where we were"
"2424",3,"First, this is a discount hotel so don't expect the Westin! The rooms are newly remodeled and clean. Request a room on the other side of the building from the highway and you will sleep fine. The neighborhood is fine and there are nice restaurants close by. I thought it was weird that I had to sign a paper stating... More"
"2425",5,"You really don't need to leave this hotel between check-in and check-out, except of course we did. My initial reaction is that it's one of the quietest places we've ever stayed. Service is excellent. Food is excellent. Checking in and out were pleasant experiences. Staff are pleasant. Our room was beautifully furnished, bed very comfortable, bathroom nicely appointed and spacious.... More"
"2426",3,"Nothing spectacular. Average. Disappointed by breakfast: there was no table available, I had to wait for 15 minutes. Rooms are ok, nothing really special. Location is good , close to restaurants and stores"
"2427",3,"Arrived early to combat traffic. Despite knowing that check-in was 4 pm, I asked that morning about the possibility of an early check-in and was told absolutely not. I returned about 3 pm to find many people checking in ahead of the 4pm deadline I was given. The carpets are worn and aging rapidly, the walls need a new coat of paint desperately. The staff was pleasant if not a little understaffed. It was a holiday weekend but this hotel is not worth the premiums they are charging."
"2428",5,"I checked in very late and was informed by the very nice guest services rep that they had oversold the hotel for the evening. I've traveled extensively and this happens occasionally and I wasn't really upset and she said they had me set up with a complimentary evening at a nearby hotel if I didn't mind a 10 minute drive....

"2429",5,"Great time clean hotel, love the area, love the fact the room was cleaned and bed was comfortable. Family enjoyed there stay. Great service from staff they was bending over backwards to support our needs."
"2430",5,"We stayed here when going to Pittsburgh for an event at Duquesne University. We love this hotel because of its proximity to Duquesne and downtown. The rooms are clean, large, and have wonderful views. The staff are always welcoming and friendly. We will continue to stay here whenever we visit Pittsburgh!"
"2431",4,"Everyone was very friendly and our room was nice and clean. My room had yellow sinks and toilet and a phone in the bathroom just like the 70's and 80's Vegas. Would definitelygo back. The only drawback was the breakfast buffet. Although it was given to us free for the first night the food was lousy. Du Pars was a much better choice.Thank you for your review! We appreciate it. If you have any advice on how we can earn that last star, then please let us know, because our goal is to provide you with five-star service."
"2432",4,"The hotel is very confortable, besides breakfast they offer wine tasting in the afternoons. The price is a bit expensive and the hotel stay a bit far from downtown Napa, so a car is required. Parking is free, which is a plus."
"2433",5,"The hotel is strategically located near the Coliseum. It is surrounded by lots of food, shopping, post office, banking, etc. It is also very easy to get to Langley AFB, 64, etc. There seemed to be a lot of late night activity on the main drive, but very little of that spilled back to this hotel. It is a great alternative to trying to secure a short term lease, but it is like living on your own. The weekly housekeeping is good, but it is only weekly."
"2434",5,"Very nice, clean and great rooms. Mary, the social director, extremely friendly, pleasant and an asset to the hotel. Some evenings there is a social event (5:30 to 7:30 wine, beer and snacks) with Mary hosting."
"2435",5,"I've stayed at numerous hotels over the past year and this room was by far the best. The room came with sofa and office space in addition to the king size bed. Surely I will stay there again."
"2436",3,"All in all, an OK experience. They have a little continental breakfast every morning, so that is nice. There is a Denny's across the street, so I did that a few mornings because I am a fan of a big breakfast variety. There is a gas station right next to the hotel that has a good selection of drinks and snacks, so that was a bonus because I didn't have to walk or drive far to get these items. A shout out to whoever makes the towel elephants. I couldn't bring myself to take it apart, it was so cool looking!"
"2437",3,"Stayed at the Aria for 3 nights March 5-8 The comps aren't what they used to be. We booked our comp suite after analyzing our offers. We turned down 400 more dollars to experience the Corner suite at the Aria... surprise!!! When we arrived they down graded our suite.. so read the fine print!!! It does say that in there... More"
"2438",4,"I needed a place away from the airport noise and chose this hotel. The small kitchen with refrigerator is very convenient for someone like me that likes to save some money on food. The room was clean and the employees super nice. I recommend anyone to stay here!We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience and for choosing to stay with us. I'm so pleased to hear that you valued the fully equipped kitchen in your room, the cleanliness of your room, and your overall stay at our hotel. The staff and I would like to thank you again for posting your review. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future!"
"2439",2,"We stayed at this hotel because it was in Boone (Iowa) and we had a visitation there and a funeral the next morning. It was clean, but we did have some issues. The smaller coffee pot (5 cup) was nice to have in the room, but it didn't work correctly. The bathroom was clean, but the tub had a really slow drain. There was a clock radio in the room, but it wasn't set to the correct time (a personal pet peeve) so I had to set it - and it was really difficult to figure out and then it was bolted down to the table with only about 3/4 leeway on the cord, so we also couldn't move it out a little bit to be able to see the time if either of us woke up during the night (again, a personal issue). However, the breakfast in the morning was really well stocked...basic continental breakfast foods with 2 waffle makers...so not very varied, but was good. Staff was in and out making certain that there was enough food out and cleaning off tables that had been used. If you need to stay in Boone, it would be alright - as long as that is all that you are expecting. Otherwise, I would suggest staying in Ames and driving over since it isn't all that far away."
"2440",4,"In town for the US Open it was a bit noisy the night the Penguins won the cup but it was a comfortable room with quick room service. The only negative was I had waived room service for the first day and the maid service never showed up all week- i had to call to get them to clean."
"2441",3,"We were there to just stop for a night on our way to the outer banks... although I will admit that our drive down was horrible, so we may have been more sensitive than normal, but this place had zero options for food or drinks. In addition, we were going to have our son just sleep on the floor, but my husband saw bugs all over the side wall... For the upcharged price, this is a no go in future. Will sleep in car next time and save 200"
"2442",3,"Pros: Location, downtown is three-four blocks away Nice, freindly staff Clean, up-to-date rooms Decent WiFi Cons: Noisy, thin walls and ceilings (if you stay here, get a room on the top floor. But--there's no elevator) Too-soft mattresses No towel racks near the shower"
"2443",5,"Me and my 13 yr. old daughter loved the hotel. The staff was great and very freindly.... the were not totally booked and they gave us a cool room overlooking the pool. They also allowed us a later than usual checkout... never know until you ask. We also enjoyed the cute workout room and the excellent breakfast buffet.Thanks Mills House for making my daughters spring break a success!!!"
"2444",4,"It's a brand new hotel with most rooms facing the sea. We had a road side room but the sound proof was very good that we hardly heard any road noises.

"2447",5,"This was a beautiful hotel with an indoor pool, very comfortable beds and an extensive breakfast buffet. Each of the employees was friendly and helpful. Will stay here again when we are on our way through."
"2448",5,"The check-out took too long."
"2449",2,"Close to downtown. That was about the only good review I can give. For a Westin The cheap thermostat causing the air conditioner not to stay at a consistent temp. down to the cheap supplied hair dryer that takes 30 min to dry a short hair person. Hope you like the neighbors because you will hear them coming and going all night long."
"2450",5,"Due to an unexpected ice storm in Maine, we needed to leave a day early. Not only did this hotel take us in a day early, they let us into the room at 10 instead of 3! The food we brought along for our Coast Guard son survived! The hotel staff was amazing, helpful and courteous. The room was spotless, NO BED BUGS!!. The hotel is located close to Walmart, many nice eateries, shopping. 15 min from Newark, an hour or so from Virginia Beach and 5 min from the Coast Guard Base. Thank you so much for making our stay in Suffolk, Virginia. We will certainly be staying there in June when our son graduates A school! Thank you!"
"2451",5,"My kids loved the pool. I loved the hot tub and the fitness area. My kids really enjoyed breakfast. Convenient location. Close to the beach. Great for the price. I will be back again. The rewards program is a great perk!"
"2452",4,"Nice hotel, great location, easy access to freeway. Pretty tropical landscaping, really nice pool fitness area. Front desk staff, friendly. Beds comfy, clean, fridge, table. Only issue seemed to be a funny smell that came and went the AC, took long for room to cool the lower the temp, unit would make a loud noise. Not sure if smell coming from the actual unit."
"2453",5,"The room was nice and clean. The staff was polite and helpful. There were always refreshments in the lobby. The lemonade was good as were the cookies. The staff offered us bottled water after check in and they were all friendly.It makes our day to hear that we excelled your expectations of cleanliness during your stay! Thank you so much for your five star review, and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit."
"2454",1,"We were invited to the wedding of a close family member in San Diego with only 3 weeks notice. A friend got us two rooms at Rodeway Inn Qualcomm at a discounted rate to help us with travel expenses. We received our confirmations 15 days prior to check in.On the very morning we left for San Diego, we received a phone call from the manager of Rodeway Inn Qualcomm telling us we were not eligible for the discounted rooms, and our reservations had been cancelled. There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements. We set off to San Diego with no accommodations. This was certainly the worst customer service we've ever experienced at any lodging establishment."
"2455",5,"Bad: sound proof need it ... people on the second floor were running around and I couldn't sleep... Good: Rooms are renovated, location was perfect finally service and breakfast was great"
"2456",4,"Bad: The food is too simple. Good: Very quite"
"2457",3,"This was a nice place to stay. Other than the lady at the front desk being a little grouchy, I have not complaints. The room was clean. Bed was very comfortable. There were not noise issues, it was amazingly quiet. I would stay there again."
"2458",5,"Loved the hotel. Very nice. Great Pool, golf and activities. There was no reason to leave the resort. Rooms were nice and food was very good. A bit pricey though. Not a vacation if you are on a budget. WE would go back- had a very nice time."

"2461",5,"Bad: No bank ATM's...scandalous...not fair. Good: I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE WESTIN. This one didn't disappoint either. Location was great, staff was great and facilities were excellent and clean! The view want bad either."
"2462",3,"Red Roof Inn is 100, smoke free, but that doesn't prevent people from smoking right outside their doors and therefore talking every hour in a half outside your door too and the smell of smoke that surrounds you every time you walk out or in. The room is what you pay for, location is right off the highway so convenient, it is 10 to 15 minutes away from everything."
"2463",5,"Great stay but if you don't have a car, your cab around would be 15 to the mall"
"2464",4,"Bad: Room walls are incredibly thin! Ambient noise from all around! I heard my neighbor sneeze, and I felt horrible coughing at night for fear of disturbing other floors! Parking and walking to the room was long and difficult with many bags. Limited hotel parking with expensive rates. Public parking becomes the only option, and while not as terribly inconvenient as you would think, it would still be nice if Miyako had their own, larger facilities. Good: Amazing location, and very cool bidet feature in the bathrooms. Spacious size rooms in the executive suites for the price value. AC kicks on very fast and cools the room nicely. Great views from floors higher up."
"2465",5,"Bad: The view. Good: Everything"

"2470",4,"My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!"
"2471",5,"Good: Breakfast was wonderful, all service staff was so great, housekeeping and front desk perfect.. cant wait to go again and stay here."
"2472",2,"Staff was pleasant. Breakfast was a little better than average. They had waffles, eggs,sausage, fruit and the usual pastries. Our room was old, smelled of cigarette smoke. Water damage, loose fixtures in the bathroom. Was supposed to stay 4 nights but found better accommodations after 2."
"2473",5,"We were driving through for one night at Blue Sands Motel. Greeted so kindly, we chose them for price we were surprised at how nice for the money.

"2478",3,"I BOOKED THE HOTEL THRU HOTELS.COM. I ASKED FOR A ROOM WITH A BALCONY BUT NOT ON THE GROUND FLOOR. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. THE MANAGER CALLED THE ROOM AND SAID THEY WOULD CHANGE US TO A 2ND FLOOR ROOM THE NEXT DAY. I ALSO NOTED THAT WE WERE IN TOWN FOR A FUNERAL, SO WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO CHANGE IN AND OUT OF ROOMS. WE WERE THERE FOR 2 NIGHTS. ON THE NEXT DAY OUR ROOM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CLEANED THERE WAS A NOTE LEFT FROM HOUSE KEEPING STATING THAT THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE BED BECAUSE WE LEFT LUGGAGE ON THE BED(THAT WAS NEW FOR ME. WE HAVE STAYED AT RESIDENCE INN AND THAT WAS NEVER AN ISSUE). THE WORSE PART WAS THAT THE HOUSEKEEPING STAFF LEFT THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPEN. WHEN WE ARRIVED BACK FROM THE FUNERAL LATE THAT EVENING THE DOOR WAS OPEN. WE DIDN'T KNOW IF SOMEONE WAS IN THE ROOM CLEANING OR IF IT WAS AN INTRUDER. MY HUSBAND JUST PUSHED IT OPEN AND THERE WAS NO ONE THERE, THE DOOR WAS JUST LEFT OPEN. NOT VERY RESPONSIBLE ON THEIR PART. I HAD SOME JEWELRY AND A LAPTOP IN THE ROOM."

"2483",4,"This hotel is clean and well kept. It looks to be newer than it actually is. It is convenient to stores and restaurants. The staff is friendly and courteous. The rooms are a good size. I found the pillows to be small and too soft for my liking. The only room available was for special needs, this was not expected. it lacked a bath tub. but the shower was ok. None of the soda machines worked correctly. It is not to close to the beach and there is no view of the harbor."
"2484",5,"Overall this is a nice hotel. However I did encounter a group of rowdy cheerleaders who were Loud. I had to complain each night about the noise but it was handled. Rooms were clean and Comfortable. I would stay here again. Sometimes you just have to complain if your stay is Unpleasant. I was compensated for my inconvenience."

"2496",5,"Bad: Used my credit card to hold reservation but was going to pay cash. When I checked out they said they already processed my credit card and would not refund it and l could not pay cash. I am from Canada and have a US bank account so when the Can and US dollars were at par I put my travel money into it. By paying with my credit card, I ended up paying an extra 150 in exchange rate and user fees. They also charged my credit card the day I booked- which I didn't know until my statement came in. Good: beds were very comfortable. breakfast in hallway every morning very convenient. location was good-very close to river and a couple of blocks from metro stations. Staff very friendly."

"2498",5,"Good: Everyone was so nice. Thank you"
"2499",4,"the room is very nice. It's very modern and a bit on the side of a luxurious room. there's a Keurig Coffee machine. The room is relatively small, but I would say this is norm for downtown Chicago. I'm paying maybe 170/night before taxes and fees."
"2500",5,"Great hotel! The staff was friendly and very professional. The facility was welcoming and appealing to the eyes. Very clean. You get free cookies in the lobby! (SMILE) My husband and I loved the room: king-sized bed the bathroom had plenty of towels/wash cloths."

"2514",4,"I love so many things about The Viceroy. It's in a perfect location right in the heart of Santa Monica. The staff is friendly and helpful, the design is beautiful, the common areas are gorgeous, rooms are smaller but very nicely appointed and the pool is small and somewhat shaded but overall it's a wonderful hotel."
"2515",4,"We stayed here on our way to Memphis It suited our needs and we'd stay again. Obviously you'd be in a car to stay here as no restaurants next door but we found plenty 5 mins away. Was a sunny day so we stopped by the pool. Small but suited us as we were the only ones there."

It's clear to see the investments that the resort makes to both keep up and maintain what they have, as well as improve other... More"
"2518",5,"Our stay was nice. The hotel is located not too far away from Mayland live and the Mills mall. If you don't have transportation of your own (as we did not since we were visiting from out of state)the hotel does offer transportation within a 5 mile radius which includes the casino and the airport. The airport is priority for the hotel so if there is an airport trip or pick up, the airport will take priority over the casino or the mall. The casino and airport are not walkable even though you can see the casino from the hotel window as there are no sidewalks all the way. The breakfast is complimentary and is better then we have seen in most hotels. We do advise you to go before 7:30 for the breakfast as it gets crowded down there. The walls are very thin and you can hear the people on the other side of the wall if they are loud. The people on the other side of us were loud until close to 6AM when they finally went to sleep. Since I keep the same hours when I travel as to when I don't, this part was disturbing to me."
"2519",3,"Hotel is nice, clean....bathroom vent was extremely loud annoying and patio door was very hard to open and unlock. But overall, stay was good!"
"2520",5,"...without the hassle of being downtown. Nestled in San Marco one block from Hendricks Ave., this cozy little hideaway is well worth looking for. The hotel is just far enough away from the traffic, yet so close to everything if you're willing to be creative.

"2525",4,"Hotels.com had a good price vs. what the hotel wanted for one night over the labor day weekend. This is a good value if you spend in 100/ night range.

"2534",2,"I spent two nights at the Metro Points Hotel. The Hotel Guests was somewhat in some of term is seemed to be helpful. The reasons I took points off because Breakfast Foods were awful. The chef used pre-packages on most of the buffet foods. The hospitality of the service was very negative. 10 charged for using microwaves is ridiculous! There is no another way to heating up my foods from take-out place. Not the best family hotel to book it. Probably more for last minute business trip. ."
"2535",4,"Quirky but clean and comfortable. No it's not a five star but resort but it doesn't pretend that it is, it's actually better because it has character and fits in perfectly with the Folly scene (which is quickly disappearing)."
"2536",5,"Free parking, included wifi, and one of the best breakfasts I have seen at this type of hotel. What's not to like? The location is pretty convenient, and the pool (while small) is a nice addition. It's not a place to hang around all day, but works great. The rooms also have microwaves and refrigerators."
"2537",2,"This hotel needs a better ventilation system!! The whole place smelled of smoke and farts. I found the casino to be very dreary and outdated. The rooms were very clean and we had a nice view. We had breakfast there and the smell of smoke permeated the restaurant so bad it was hard to eat. I wouldn't stay here again, for sure."

Museum of modern art is 1 minute walk, Space needle 1 minute walk and the monorail is a 1 minute walk.There is also a collection of restaurants and shops an easy 2 minute walk from the HotelWe checked in late, about midnight with friendly and efficient staff.The room has a queen bed with separate kitchen, bathroom and lounge room and is very comfortable.The Hotel has free tea and coffee in the foyer and a happy hour between 4.00pm and 7.00pm every night with US3.00 pints.Breakfast is sufficient with both hot and cold selections buffet style.The free shuttle to a radius of a kilometre was enough to get to Pikes market which was good.

"2555",5,"Bad: A/C in the room didn't work at first but was fixed. Good: Great experience"
"2556",4,"For the price it was exactly what I expected. Friendly staff, clean rooms, a little weak on the breakfast options."
"2557",5,"We got some needed clothes shopping done and then had dinner and drinks at El Gaucho. What a wonderful hotel and connected restaurant experience. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys first class service and wonderful food."
"2558",5,"This hotel is new and extremely clean (trust me...I checked every corner -) ) and the nice girl at the counter (I think her name was Tari or something similar) was very helpful and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend this hotel. It is right behind a big shopping center and just 30 minutes from Galveston"
"2559",5,"Hotel was excellent. Staying a second night and getting the room over forty dollars cheaper without booking through hotels dot com was even better. Lesson learned."
"2560",5,"Bad: The parking garage was farther than we thought, was inconvenient but realize its a city and parking is always difficult. I would of liked valet service and would of paid more happily for it. Good: Yes it's small put clearly stated and really set up well. Was very fresh and updated not to mention clean. Would defiantly stay here again on our next visit. The staff in the evening was very efficient and helpful."
"2561",2,"When I first walked into the hotel(at approximately 15 minutes after check-in) there were about 3 or 4 employees sitting at tables and chairs at the entrance. (This was the common area where the continental breakfast is served). Upon check in I was told there were no rooms available. The employees had not finished cleaning the rooms. I am from NJ and was in VA for the weekend. The front desk clerk asked me if I had anywhere else to go while they had the opportunity to finish cleaning the room. The check in time stated on my reservation was 3:00 p.m. Apparently, the hotel did not receive this message. Eventually, I was able to receive a room. However, I definitely will never stay at this hotel again due to the bad service received at check in and for the attitudes of some of the employees."
"2562",3,"We had no tv. Would not work even with staff. Toilet seat almost fell off when using. Kids kept running on floor above until 11pm."
"2563",5,"This hotel was nice and clean.Walking distance to several restaurants,it was an easy drive to get there."
"2564",5,"Check-in was easy. Parked in the free parking, which is a rarity in Seattle.

"2582",3,"The room we stayed in was mostly renovated and clean and really not too bad for a hotel that accepts dogs for 10 per night.

"2583",1,"Two positives: the front desk staff and the lobby. ALL downhill from there. Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER. I will never stay here again--for the same money you can stay at the EconoLodge next door--certainly no better, but how could it be worse"

If we decide to do another overnight stay in Hershey, we will definitely stay again!"
"2586",1,"There were dead bugs on the floor of the bathroom and carpet. There was dog fur or some sort of animal fur on the furniture. There was a cigarette burn on the sheets. The room smelled like mold. The comforter smelled bad. I didn't see any bed bugs but I was paranoid about it all night. The bed was lumpy and felt like it was going to tip off of the platform. I could not believe I paid 100 to stay in this room for a night, but everything was sold out."
"2587",5,"We booked Nopsi for my 40th birthday and this hotel lived up to my expectations. My spouse is a lifetime Marriott Platinum member so we have had our fair share of hotel stays. The service and hospitality was amazing. The staff was courteous without feeling stuffy...the best way to describe them was authentic with a large does of Southern hospitality and they were all wonderful.They upgraded us to a better room which comprised of a wrap around view. The upgrade was complimentary even though they were fully booked. Two thumbs up and what a wonderful way to kick-off my birthday.The hotel bed is amazing. I described it as feeling hugged but not hot. I received the best sleep and my spouse said the same. I'm a side sleeper and he's a back sleeper so it's shocking that we both like the mattress.The bed was so comfortable that I emailed the hotel to get the make of the mattress and will order it for our own home.We frequented the lobby bar and the drinks were on point.I don't recall the name of my drink but it reminded me of salty plum but our bartender described it as vinegary. Personally, I thought it was well-balanced. The Frenchman was also well-made here. The rooftop bar was a scene but not compared to Orange County or LA. Much less pretentious and the skyline was pleasant.As others have mentioned, the hotel is not in the middle of the action but walking distance to Bourbon St and many of the best local restaurants (GW Fins being my fav for the grilled oysters and desserts).Bottom line, I would stay here again the next time we are in NOLA.Sara, thank you so much for choosing to stay at NOPSI! Its wonderful to learn that you had such a fun and memorable 40th birthday with us. We love making all occasions special, and were delighted to have won you over.

We were able to walk to the Casino, Bourbon Street, Canal Street, etc- it is really a great little hotel in a perfect location. Oh yeah, the roof- we thoroughly enjoyed. Nice mingle spot!

"2598",5,"The room was good and on the opposite side of the highway and low (2nd floor) as we heard others say something about the highway noise. The breakfast and shuttle saved us a ton of money and time. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is the same everyday but there is enough of a variety if you stay long it won't get boring. The shuttle will take you within 3 miles and the DC Metro station is within this range. They start at 6:30 am if you wan to get an early start but they had 3 different vans so we had no wait anytime we wanted to leave. Short wait when you called for pick-up but not long. No parking hassles in DC (15+ a day or at the Metro station (5 a day). It was hot (100+) so the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC."

"2603",2,"My room was clean but everything was run down. The carpet was ripped and coming up near the door and the bedding looked like it came from the 70s. The only good thing was the new flat screen TV. My stay was ok but I would not stay there again the area isn't all that great and I did not feel safe going to my car."
"2604",3,"One of our rooms was above a restaurant/bar/lounge which was playing very loud music for several hours after midnight. The noise from the bar kept me awake for hours. As you can imagine, this made for a most undesirable stay. In addition, the temperature in the rooms was very cold and the beds had only a thin blanket on them. There were no extra blankets in the rooms and there was not a thermostat in the rooms that would have allowed us to control the temperature."
"2605",5,"Hotel graciously granted my request for a different room, as I was assigned a 3rd floor room between several occupied by very boisterous girls basketball team. Teachers/coaches let them run wild until well after midnight. Unfortunately the team continued to run up and down corridors on all 3 floors."

"2610",5,"The place is great. We stayed with a baseball team and it was a good time. The entire place is new and super clean. The front desk staff has a great attitude and treat guest right. They have complimentary waters, too."
"2611",5,"The hotel staff were very helpful and courteous. The room was clean and had plenty of room for our family of 4. Not immediately in the highly commercial area which we loved. The beach on the Chesapeake Bay wasn't extremely crowded which was a bonus. They have very nice hotel ammenities including an indoor outdoor pool, hot tub, semi private beach, water activities, kids camps, etc. We had the opportunity to hear a live band in the restaurant too. Food Lion right across the street and only a short drive to the more commercialized area. We loved it and would definitely stay there again."
"2612",5,"Room 11. One queen and a double. Place was clean and the beds are comfortable. I have a brand new Stearns and Foster and I slept just as good here as at home. No amenities but I just wanted a bed for on the way to Pagosa Springs."
"2613",3,"Wallpaper peeling in room, water drains slow in sink, soda machine was empty. Otherwise quite and clean."
"2614",5,"This hotel was absolutely wonderful. It has a special inner court to walk your pup. A very nice discount when someone in your family is in the local hospital. Centrally located for access to St. Luke Hospital, downtown Boise. It is quiet, the staff is helpful and understanding to your coming and going at odd times day and night and... More"
"2615",3,"Hotel work in progress. Pretty enough and nice roof top bar. Tiny gym. Terrible WiFi and worse service and effort in dining room. Its not a great deal with these issues. If they care they can improve but not clear they do. Also my room was not clean until 6 on the day we checked in forcing us to wait 2 hours. Thank you for choosing NOPSI! We appreciate your feedback. I am disappointed to hear that service did not meet your expectations. If travels should bring you back, we would love the opportunity to demonstrate our service levels in the future.Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"2616",4,"We stayed at the Holiday Inn on a weekend shopping trip to NYC. Our flight arrived at 8am and was traveling with my 3 month old baby. They let us check in early which was nice. It was very easy to go to NYC #320 bus just outside the hotel with a 20 min bus ride to Port Authority. Wifi could not access from our room had to go to lobby to get internet. Other then that it was good. Lots of dining options just outside the hotel. Walmart 5 min away. Would stay there again."
"2617",4,"Very good hotel to stay"
"2618",5,"While you can always look hard enough to find something wrong with a hotel, the Omni for our two nights there was excellent. We experienced a clean room, very friendly and helpful staff, good food, and location. The bellman went out of their way for us and we had no complaints. We would stay there again."
"2619",4,"Spent 3 weeks here. Had a great room. Staff is helpful and attentive. Pool was a major asset. Clean and comfortable."
"2620",3,"Hotel room was nice. My only complaints was no extra bedding readily available in rooms closet, as I am used to at other hotels and the restaurant inside of hotel was over priced for the limited amount of food options it had."
"2621",4,"Road work made entry and departure a challenge. Not in the hotel's control."
"2622",1,"IF YOU BOOK THERE BE PREPAIRED! YOU NEED AN EXTRA 150 A DAY. In addition to the 35 Resort Fee. And to top it off my room isn't ready. Staying here is like having a pretty girl with an ugly attitude. It only looks good on the outside. The management is terrible"
"2623",4,"We drove in with no reservation and the staff were friendly and helpful. They only take cash or check. oThe kitchen was nice but there wasn't a microwave or cookie sheet. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was a little soft."

"2626",5,"My husband and I decided to go down to Hampton for a weekend over Valentines Day. We had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. They were all very friendly and we got in real late on our first night and the check in process was smooth and stil friendly at 1:00am. I was glad to know that I was receiving the same service at 1:00am checking in as I would have during a normal check in hour. The room was so comfortable and clean. We loved our stay and it was close to all the near by attractions."
"2627",4,"Elevator (necessary for me) friendly staff clean, spacious room, comfortable bed. My husband and I arrived late, which was no problem for the concierge -- we were made to feel very welcomed, not as if we were putting anyone out."
"2628",5,"Well this was a surprise find, wonderful location, Marina view to our front and Harbour view to our back, the restaurant and bar were first class, good service and helpful staff. The room was a good size and clean. The small town was quaint with enough shops and restaurant to keep most people happy. Would recommend this area if you... More"
"2629",3,"A basic, dated motel. On the positive side, it was very welcoming when I arrived and the room was clean and tidy. I can see the (newish) owner have made an effort, but really the property is in need of more upgrading than it's received."
"2630",4,"This best western is the next best thing to the casino maybe even equal comfort that's close to the boardwalk. I have been staying at this location for years. I even have a favorite room. They since have remodeled and it's really nice modern decor. It's generally inexpensive, but can sometimes be the same rate as the casinos because of its popularity. I always enjoy my stay and it's close to everything. One block from the boardwalk. There is a seven eleven across the street that has everything. There is a rite aid, liquor store, restaurants and laundromat few steps away. Highly recommend this location and nice staff in the lobby."
"2631",5,"When travelling south for our annual snowbird trip, the Best Western at Moses Lake, Washington has often been our first stop.

"2633",5,"Good location convenient to drives through the vineyard districts and excellent downtown restaurants. Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable. Shawn and Shanirra are a great value to our staff and I am pleased they had the advise and information you needed. You are right either book direct or at Bestwestern.com for the best price. We will see you again the next time your in the area."
"2634",5,"Went for Thunder Over Louisville 2015. VERY polite and friendly staff and desk crew. Ice makers were broken on 2nd and 3rd floors, but there were personnel on site actively working the problem, so it wasn't so bad. Perfect location in the heart of Downtown Louisville. Would certainly stay again next year!"
"2635",4,"still very good. I would say though that this is not the second ranking hotel in Chesapeake as it was listed the last tie I looked at the ratings. The corridors could use new carpeting.

"2636",5,"We attained this hotel at a great price. The room was comfortable and conveniently located. The gym and pool was a definate plus. We would choose this hotel again."
"2637",3,"Although clean, this hotel is in great need of renovation. Breakfast is the usual selections. Front desk was most helpful when we inquired about a local church and their times of services. Tha hotel was very close to several restaurants within walking distance, and the Interstate and, most importantly, the Ice Arena."
"2638",5,"This hotel is an easy on / off from the freeway. The hotel staff were polite and courteous. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. During both of our stays, we were the only ones using the pool and that was a bonus. The breakfast bar impressed us with the variety of options available. Definitely recommend this hotel!"
"2639",5,"I was hesitant about booking this room but only needed a hotel for one night before heading to Panama City Beach but got a good price so decided to go ahead and stay here and we ended up being very pleased the rooms were very clean and spacious had a wonderful siting area and a nice pool that the kids...

"2641",4,"This is the 2nd time staying at the hotel. Very convenient to a club we go to for concerts. There are a number of good eating places nearby. A little confusing to get to if you are not familiar with the area. For some reason, there was only one bath towel in the room when we checked in, but they were able to get us a 2nd set shortly after we notified them. Also, the shower may have been hooked up incorrectly because H meant cold and C meant hot in our case. The breakfast is very good. Overall, we would stay there again good rates, friendly front desk, and the breakfast are all reasons to come back."
"2642",5,"2 weeks prior to Christmas until now, my unfortunate situation caused me to have to stay this Marriott for a month. I must say that I have had the best of care this hotel.

"2647",5,"Great staff and location was perfect to hop on a van pool for downtown. Staff was helpful and great parking lot. Needed space since I was pulling a trailer rooms were spacious. Breakfast was awesome would stay againDear Recent Guest, Thank you so much for staying at the Embassy Suites Nashville Airport. I am so glad you enjoyed all aspects of your stay. Thank you for your business, and we look forward to seeing you again in the future."
"2648",4,"staff very nice This hotel allows pets keep that in mind if you are not an animal person. I think the first floor is reserve for pet owners so if you don't love pets ask for an upper floor."
"2649",5,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staff was very helpful, grounds were clean, we really enjoyed the fire pits, the breakfast, and our whole experience. It was easy to get down to the beach, you can even walk to local restaurants on the beach."
"2650",4,"Served it's purpose... room is clean and comfortable, bathroom has very limited spaces.."
"2651",2,"The hotel is listed as 'ocean front' but there 2 buildings. The second building is across the street from the ocean. That wouldn't be so bad but our room faced out on the old rusting parking structure. You could touch the rusting girders from our door. It was very unpleasant - I wouldn't stay here again. Not at all the standard I would expect from Best Western."
"2652",4,"The Best Western Inn at Napa was a very comfortable place to stay. The room was a very decent size and had good amenities. Parking was free and it was in a good location to be able to explore Napa, although admittedly not in the most picturesque part of the valley. A very solid choice if you want a slightly cheaper option and don't mind not staying in a farmhouse!Thank you for your review. We are glad you enjoyed your stay."

"2655",5,"Your staff is extremely friendly, sincere and professional. A sense of caring, and security was clearly evident - with a driver to ensure a positive experience was provided. Room was nicely furnished with all the amenities. Breakfast and manager's special was the right touch with the right level of support too. Entire hotel is very warm to include common areas as well. Exercise room has everything to get in a workout and the pool and hot tub is a great treat too. The papers, especially the WSJ is a great complimentary item. Loved all of it and will certainly be back. Being from Hawaii, this stay was very nice and very warm !! Travel to Maryland often and first time staying here, but not the last."
"2656",3,"We arrived and the helpful staff got us an early check in which was much appreciated, our room was a pet friendly room so hardwood floors which was a bit cold and didn't give a cozy feel, I understand as it's practical for pets.

"2662",4,"Good except there was only a breakfast buffet on Saturday morning."
"2663",4,"The rooms were fairly loud and the bed were just okay. There also was not a lot of restaurants around that were open past 10 so if you like to eat late like us it might be an issue. Great breakfast with lots of variety. Nice to have the shuttle even though there were limited times. We took it when we could other wise just used uber which was not really a problem for us. The room also had a little fridge and microwave which was great for storing and having snacks."
"2664",5,"The hotel is fully functional. I like the fact there are no hallways, as you enter the rooms from the outside. Parking is plentiful. The pool wasn't filled and that was a bummer. The lady at the desk upon check in was pretty snippy. The gal working the desk the next morning was awesome. The restaurant, Bailey's, was worth the stay alone. The food was amazing. The room wasn't perfect. But there were plenty of channels to watch, and the soft water was nice. The bed was big and comfy. There were a couple parts of the room that weren't the cleanest and the exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work. All in all I stand behind this place being a good choice if you're looking to stay in Norfolk. Don't give the Hampton all your money. Stay here instead."
"2665",5,"Good: The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! The location is away from the congestion of the strip but easily accessible. The Westin will be my first and only option when staying in Vegas."

"2667",4,"I stayed one night at this beautiful building in Back Bay. Unfortunately, my particular room had a very uncomfortable bed that was not level. I believe the problem was the mattress itself just being old, not the bed frame. I had to put a book between the mattress and the box spring to level it a bit. Additionally, the room was extremely hot, owing to the radiator being left on while the room was empty. I recommend that the hotel consider keeping the heat off between guests. Otherwise, the facility was great. The public areas are beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful."
"2668",5,"When we came for a visit for a friend's wedding, we chose this hotel based on its price an amenities for our group of 5.

Room was average but I felt safe and slept really well which is unusual for me at a hotel! Will definitely stay here again and recommend it."
"2676",5,"A return visitor. Very nice room, found it to be clean, very comfortable bed, and a good shower. The staff were extremely helpful and polite. Breakfast was real nice with good variety which made for a good start to the day. Recommend this hotel when in Fresno."
"2677",5,"The suite was very spacious and the amenities were good. The living room has comfortable chairs, a roomy couch/convertible bed, and an adequate dining area. The bedroom made sleeping easy and pleasurable. Although the hotel's fitness room is sparse the pool and spa are delightful with its glass ceiling and walls providing great views of the surrounding foliage. I also enjoyed the complementary full breakfast with eggs made to order. I will definitely return to this hotel."
"2678",5,"We stayed here end of July 2015. We picked the room here because it was central to some places we were going on vacation. I don't know why this was rated at a 2!! If you want a 5 star hotel then book a five star hotel! Hotel was very clean and updated. Free breakfast was excellent. Pool was nice. Room was great. Only downside was beds weren't the greatest. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Can't beat the price and get all that anywhere else. Was a small hotel which was fine for us. Made it that much more homey. Would definatly recommend staying here."

The location was great and the staff was very helpful and friendly, but our room and bathroom/shower were very small and the bed was hard as a rock. It seems standard these days that 1-bed rooms will be outfitted with a King bed and 2-bed rooms with 2 Queens or at least Doubles. Our room had a Queen bed which took up most of the room and my mom and brother's room had 2 Twins!

The carpet in all of our rooms was dirty and mine was dirty and torn. One of the rooms had a 90 dollar charge under Other which the hotel could not explain so they removed it. And when they were checking my bed to see what was biting me, it was particulars on the box spring that did not belong to me. So how was that possible if they had put on new linen prior to me coming.

We had a Studio Ocean View and a 2 Bedroom Resort View. The... More"
"2710",5,"Not only myself, but my family loved this hotel and we will return again. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants good service as well as a nice, clean hotel stay:) The rooms were excellent and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was awesome and I loved the pool/jaccuzi and computer room. Onsite laundry is recommended as well as the room service. Great location as there were many restaurants nearby. If I could change anything, it would be the structure of the hotel room (to include more privacy for a family of four...door or divider). Best hotel I've stayed at in a very long time!"
"2711",3,"To noisey, other guest were to loud kids running up and down hallways. After coming back to room from being out all day room smelt like weed, coming from room next door. Room above the bathroom when guest would take showers you can hear the water dropping on our ceiling causing a large water stain on ceiling. To expensive for that stay with all problems."
"2712",3,"This hotel was a good value. The rooms are clean and comfortable and mine was newly upgraded. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. The only real issue is the noise...constant hammering that seemed as though it was in the room next to me. Also, the hot water in my bathroom did not function, so I ended up taking a cold shower. Needless to say, the noise and lack of hot water made for a disappointing stay from the standpoint of comfort. Still, a good value with easy parking and not too far from either DC or Baltimore if you are visiting."
"2713",5,"Stayed one night while travel through. Closer to perfection: Hotel was clean, huge room, comfortable beds, temperature, breakfast. Even warm chocolate chip cookies at check-in. Price was low, budget price."
"2714",2,"The room was not clean, The light did not work over the vanity and the TV did not work. Had we known the TV did not work before morning we would've asked for another room."
"2715",4,"We liked the hotel very much. The room was quite cosy. There was a shuttle service to the nearest subway station. The only thing I did not like is that our check-in receptionist wanted us to pay only by card. But the payment conditions of our cards do not allow taking money without entering a PIN code and by ourselves. The receptionist insisted by demanding if otherwise a 200 deposit (we had not known about this condition before) and we agreed about the card. The payment result in one day was declined payment and a blocked by our bank card (as the bank considered the payment suspicios or the card as stolen by an American). So, finally we paid cash. Please, respect customers and their banks' attempt to protect them. But altogether I did like our stay there and enjoyed it."
"2716",4,"We were lucky to be one the first guest at this brand new hotel in Napa , we were Very satisfied. The staff although new they tried to do their best. Now when I travel I always check if Hampton inn hotel is near by ."
"2717",4,"The location of this hotel is perfect. It's literally steps away from the aquarium, World of Coke and Centennial Park.

I still give it 4... More"
"2719",5,"The Press hotel was perfect right from the checkin. The hotel is immaculate, the rooms are amazing and the beds are very comfortable.

"2721",4,"Pulling into parking lot, motel looks very old. However rooms were spotless and I'm a nitpicker on cleanliness. Owner very accommodating. Priced a little high for the area but beds comfortable. No breakfst but they did offer coffee and donuts in a clean common area as well as very clean laundry facilities. Stay again Probably"
"2722",2,"Very disappointed. Motel was clean but lacked amenities. I was charged 79 for a Friday night stay. They advertised 60 for double occupancy. Was told weekend rates were 10 higher Will not recommend this motel."

"2728",3,"Hotel room was dirty after sleeping on pillow case observed a blood stain. Shower was awful."
"2729",3,"Parking fee is too expensive. 29 dollars per night is a lot. Hotel should review and consider to low that price for customers. Personnel that is taking care of the cars (valet pkng) think that are in the racing driving the cars too fast."
"2730",5,"Joy! She was there whenever we needed anything and she was so flexible and understanding. She made great suggestions and understood what we needed before we did. That is kind of how the whole hotel worked. Everything was stocked, clean and worked well. You could ask any staff member for something and they made it happen. Breakfast was stocked and the staff members there were quick to clean and help out. I was really blown away by everyone's attitude. No one seemed to be tired of dealing with guests like you see at other hotels. Carlos checked us out and he showed us the same amount of flexibility and the didn't overcharge for things they could have. Also, it's a great location, close to anything you'd need.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

"2734",5,"Last minute stay and we could not have been more pleased! We stayed in a 2 bedroom with another couple and it was just perfect. The morning breakfast was out of this world!

"2739",5,"I was surprised at how nice this hotel was, especially for the price. I won't stay anywhere else. Beautiful lobby and rooms. Best free breakfast anywhere. I don't know if it was recently remodeled but everything looks brand new."
"2740",3,"So you're on the road and reach Carrollton in early evening. Where to stay Given that Carrollton is a small city, options are limited the fall-back choice is a hotel in a well-known chain, which hopefully will insure at least a minimum level of quality. This Best Western fits that description, based on my recent experience with a one-night stay.... More"
"2741",2,"The only good thing about this hotel is the proximity to Kings Dominion. I will be driving to the park next time. The hotel is right next to the highway, which for me is a security concern. The staff was not overly friendly. The room is a bed and shower, not overly nice, or clean. If you are looking for a place to sleep and shower only (not your most comfortable stay) OR cannot afford a nicer hotel this is the place for you. Although the attached Denny's is convenient, it is dirty and we were served cold food. Hope this helps make your decision."

"2745",5,"We had another excellent vacation at Honua Kai. I looked around at the competitors - Westin / Sheraton / Marriott, but renting a Honua Kai condo through VRBO is still a considerable savings.

"2746",5,"I came in late after a long drive from Vegas ending in a whole lot of highway exits and concentration to get to Napa! I was greeted by a friendly night staff who was expecting me, and (not sure of his name) made me feel more relaxed immediately. I even got a little welcome pack with a snack and water. That was much appreciated!Breakfast was not included, fruit and granola bars were out in the lobby. A hotel discount was offered at the friendly Denny's next door. My room was quiet and all 3 of the morning staff were incredibly helpful the next morning helping me map out my day of driving, and helping me choose and book my next hotels. The hotel is a convienent location, not too far off the main highway. Near all services and malls if needed.We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and look foward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley!"

"2748",5,"The hotel was great. We drove in and our room was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed room service and the staff was great. Will stay here again when in Suffolk."
"2749",5,"Bad: The bathroom toilet area is tight. Would not probably be comfortable for larger person. You can hear through walls bit isn't much of an issue as probably will not be in room most of time. Good: Great location to beach and bars/restaurants. Convenient beach service as related to provided towel, chair, and umbrella service. Very good happy hour prices as related to that areas prices."

I understand the importance of receiving a value of staying in a downtown hotel, and Im sorry you didnt feel you received that value while staying in the hotel. At this time, the hotel is undergoing a major re-imaging of the lobby space and exterior with additional plans to begin the rooms and fitness area.

We were not able to get to our reserved king room because supposedly the battery in the door was going bad and couldn't get in after going back to the office 3times. We were finally given a room with double bed. We would have gone elsewhere but ther were no vacanicies in the town. When arriving after driving for hours we were told there was no restroom to use and then trying to get into our room with no success, we ended up going to a restaurant next door. We will never go to the Super 8 in Crawfordsville again. When we told them we were unhappy with a room with a double bed, we were told you wont be able to do anything since you didn't go through them directly (since we booked through hotels.com)"

Had we chosen what restaurant we would have just stayed at the hotel and ate there. We did the Link, and went to the Crown Shopping Center it was pretty awesome. We also walked through Washington Park to go to Union Station. It was a beautiful hotel, and we loved the view from our room on the 38th floor.

The pool was relaxing and clean although the hot tub was way too hot. The pool has an adult time after 11:00pm but it is not monitored so the pool and hot tub had kids (both from and not from the hotel) in it at that time. Get to the pool early to get a seat as there are not many and they go fast. It was nice to use the bikes for a ride since they are free for the first 3 hours. I would return to the Hotel in the future."

He did not explain why the room was not ready. His attitude was that it was that way and there was nothing he could do about it. We had to wait for over one hour and only when we approached the clerk and inisted on the room then only he procedded to give us a room. The next day we returned from a late breakfast at 12:05 pm and we were not able to get into our room as the card would not unlock the door."

We got a check in two hours in advance.Bedroom is clean and has a good size. We asked for an extra bed and it was put in the bedroom quickly. The restroom is also good. Not fancy but comfortable and clean.There's no breakfast included, which is not a good point, but there are several restaurants nearby (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and others). The hotel is also close to several train stations.Wifi works well in the bedroom. The fees are not so cheap, but for that location all hotels use to be expensive, so I'd say this one offers a good cost-benefit ratio.In general it was a good experience and I'd stay there again in the future.Dear Camila LThank you very much for the review of your recent stay with us at The Central Loop HotelI am delighted that we were able to offer you good value for money and you were able to enjoy all the amenities that we offer and appreciated our great location from which to get out and see the city.I was especially delighted to read about the service we offered you - we know that these small things make all the difference.

"2802",2,"Confusing and less than desirable internet, front desk was no help. Room was so so. my particular room had an a/c that smelled like a dirty foot but perhaps it's just that room. Granite by rest room was weirdly stained, I'm not sure how that happens"
"2803",3,"There were no towels or blankets in our room. When I called the front desk, they made me come down to pick up the towels. They said that they were out of blankets. Really How does a hotel run out of blankets I guess someone was on vacation when the need to order more blankets was supposed to be placed."

"2810",5,"Stayed here after getting in on a very late flight. Quick check-in, clean room, nice complimentary breakfast."
"2811",4,"Excellent staff provides great service at a reasonable price. Rooms were clean quiet. Breakfast items were plentiful fresh. The requirement for a minimum of 200 characters for a review is annoying."
"2812",4,"Hotel is situated right next to space needle (major attraction in Seattle downtown). Across the street there is the space needle, the Chihuly gardens, the EMP, and the Seattle center, a lovely park with an amazing playground. Breakfast in hotel was complimentary and was good considering a budget hotel (3 star). The courteous and always willing to serve staff and Chef played a big role. Free 24 hr shuttle within a mile of hotel but sometime wait time is high if you are in downtown markets.Well worth it in Seattle!Devendra G,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout Seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. Please let us know when you plan on returning to Seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sarah Junge"
"2813",2,"The good points: it's relatively inexpesive, it was clean, and the service was good. The bad: it's close to a heavily used road (think noise), and its not quaint or luxurious. The brochure claims that you get a complimentary Breakfast. But what they actually give you is 2.50 off your breakfast at Dennys. This basically covered the cost of our coffee. I don't think Dennys has a breakfast on the menu for 2.50."
"2814",3,"The reviews made this hotel seem better than it was. It was fine. And we could have been in a better location for the same rate with more local amenities nearby."
"2815",5,"Beautiful place near Bourbon Street but quiet. Staff was warm and welcoming, rooms were very clean and full of charm. Would recommend to anyone. Very close to restaurants and other places to visit. Great trip. Thank you"
"2816",4,"This hotel is a reasonably good place to stay if you want to visit the Napa Valley. Our room was clean and pleasant, the staff members we encountered were helpful and professional, and the price we paid for our room (during December of 2014) was reasonable. However, potential guests should be aware that, according to information we were given by a staff member, rates may be different during the summer.Thank you for your review. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and the service we provided. Yes the summer rates are higher, but we are still one of the most reasonably price hotels during that time of year. Hope to see you again."
"2817",4,"Bad: The room was really small for a family of 6. Good: The staff is really friendly"
"2818",5,"This is a pleasant location with a very helpful staff. I was greeted in a friendly way and my room was as selected on line. The location is perfect for my meetings with FL Government representatives. I would recommend this hotel in Tallahassee."
"2819",1,"This place is the worst ever!! First of all, we had to pay for our entire stay up front (before we saw the room). Then when we got to the room, it reeked of cigarettes and had cigarette burns on everything. There were roaches coming in under the door and smashed bugs on the wall! There was no hot water... More"

"2822",5,"We were pleasantly surprised with the Hilton Garden Inn. When we arrived, we thought it must be very new, rather than 8 years old, because everything was so clean and fresh.

Perhaps it was the dust storm created on a windy day by the unpaved lot next door that created a scene from the Grapes of Wrath as the Joads outran a duststorm that literally almost obliterated the hotel.

"2825",4,"Me and my husband decided to get away for a weekend and found this hotel online. It had everything we needed plus a mini-fridge and an lcd tv. The room was clean and comfortable. A very delightful stay. :)"
"2826",4,"Found the hotel to be conveniently located and tastefully decorated. Service was polite and prompt. My room was great: clean comfortable and again, tastefully decorated without looking suburban-generic. Try to get a balcony room if you can. It's so nice to be able to open the French doors and let the sounds of New Orleans into your room! Loved the rooftop pool, we were lucky enough not to have had too many children to deal with. I would definitely stay here again."
"2827",5,"The room was really nice but the service was even better. They even have a indoor pool which was a great feature. we will definitely stay again."

"2832",5,"Excellent staff, clean room, easy to check in and out. Great value. The room had wifi which worked well and a great refrigerator. The bed was comfortable and we were able to control the temperature to our liking. We had plenty of towels and washcloths, and they were nice and white and smelled clean."
"2833",5,"I was surprised when I arrived at this hotel. The staff are all very nice and helpful. The hotel is easy to find and is very close to the downtown area and sports arenas. The hotel has a nice restaurant and a nice sports bar. My hotel room was clean and seemed to have been recently updated."
"2834",3,"Location good right off turnpike. Carpets in hallways needed to be replaced long ago.Air conditioner did not work but the friendly staff moved us to another room immediately."
"2835",4,"This is a nice property, just by the lake union. The folks at the front desk were warm, friendly and helpful. I really liked this gentleman who would even strain his neck if there are lots of people at the reception and and peek out to say welcome back! when I return from office! Ha!There are a lots of eateries by the lake, so that's a win too.Some improvement opportunities - this is the only hotel where I found the housekeeping would just keep the bed and bath but wouldn't clear out used glasses, plates, soda cans etc. Those stuff were there on the table even after housekeeping was done.It would be great to have some variety in their room service. Especially if it rains, people opt to stay in have some food and I found the bistro options very limited.Also, the bistro staff were either very nice or made a bad impression - for instance, this one lady with a curly bobbed hair appeared very rude and made me feel like I am serving her when she came to deliver my food and in another instance, this one man appeared oh so friendly, almost too friendly and the moment I signed the receipt he was looking for the tip amount - making the whole thing feel like a forced show to get tip rather than genuine hospitality.But yea, the property is great and everything is at walkable or short driving distance. Overall 4 star experience."
"2836",5,"We were visiting our daughter and found this hotel online. It was conveniently located for the activities that we planned for the weekend."
"2837",5,"My husband and I have been to Charleston multiple times and stayed at a lot of different places in the ""Historic Downtown"". This is out favorite! The staff is amazing! The valet guys actually went to my vehicle to pump up my little girls floaties (I have a tire/air pump to plug into my car). Then they delivered the floaties to the pool!The hotel was also clean and so convenient to everything!"

"2839",3,"The ad says that the rooms have been redone and the pictures look great, but in reality we had a poorly patched hole in the bathroom door, rusty tub fixtures, and the obviously new paint was chipping. Comforters looked new, but the sheets were super scratchy. Also, it is a motel style place (which was not clear from the ad), which means people smoke off the balcony outside their room and the air conditioner sucks the gross smoky smell into your room. It was fine for last minute since literally nothing else was available last minute for the night were were staying for business in DC, but normally for an extra 20 bucks you could find something MUCH nicer."
"2840",5,"We stayed as a layover, booked it a few hours before we arrived. Staff was phenominal! Hotel was clean and pretty, food was wonderful. Walked to bricktown for dinner, watched a baseball game out our window in the stadium to the south. Great stay!"
"2841",4,"Bad: No pool. The Breakfast room was not appealing. The buffet was limited. Good: The heavenly beds"
"2842",1,"Mold in bathroom. Blankets had fur balls (old). Klennex box rusted. AC loud. The property had old decor. Will not be returning to the property. I will not be returning to Red Roof Inn. If this is how they run their inns I will stay somewhere else."

"2844",5,"The hotel staff was friendly and helpful at any hour of the day or night. Food was hot and freshly prepared. The only down-side was the fire alarms went off 3 of the 4 nights we were there - twice with cause and once accidentally. The shuttle service is a great plus and staff willingly took us to/from the Metro station every day. Even though the location seems a little far from downtown DC, it's extremely convenient to the Metro and other amenities in the neighborhood. For a mid-range hotel, it's quite comfortable. Extra kudos to Stacey :-)"
"2845",4,"The Embassy Suites Crystal City is a nice hotel, the closest one to the Pentagon. They will drive you to the Pentagon in their shuttle but you have to walk across the whole parking lot to get to the entrance. If it is raining or snowing that might be a uncomfortable walk. The walk to the Metro is the longest in Crystal City but still not too bad, about 5 blocks. Their shuttle is great, they will drop you off to restaurants or the metro, but you might have to wait a bit to get a ride. My only issue are they do not have enough smoking rooms - they always say they are full and they have plenty of rooms and floors to add smoking rooms and it is pricy - but that is to be expected in DC."
"2846",4,"I stayed her while coordinating a class in one of the hotel's meeting rooms. As the meeting planner, I was upgraded to a wonderful room on the 10th floor. It had a bar, living room, dining area, large separate bedroom and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a huge shower. The bed was very comfortable. The meeting facility is very well run, and worth consideration if you have an event. While there is a large selection of restaurants in the casino, I only patronized two: The Cafe Sienna served up a decent, inexpensive early bird breakfast special. The Bagel Cafe Express has pretty good sandwiches, although they seemed a bit pricey. Otherwise, I preferred to get out and eat somewhere else. Across the street are a Cheesecake Factory and a Gordon Biersch Brewpub that are both great places to eat."

"2848",5,"Overall this is a great property. The lobby, restaurant, and hotel rooms are really well done. Lots of nice touches with great designs. Tons of character here. We stayed in a double queen room which we thought had plenty of space. The gym is located between two floors and has a Peloton bike and the hotel provides the shoes. As a cycling, I thought this was awesome. I already had a Peloton login. The music in the gym, however, was too loud and we called to have it turned down and the staff couldn't figure out how to do it. The staff were all friendly and courteous - bellhops, front desk staff and concierge all included. Location very convenient to a number of places downtown. Beds and pillows were comfortable. TVs changed channels without the annoying 1 second delay at most other hotels. There's some construction going on at the property next door to be aware of, but it's New York and good luck finding somewhere without construction. Definitely recommend.Dear chitripguy, Thank you very much for your detailed and wonderful review. I am so glad you enjoyed our property from our comfortable rooms and the gym. We pride ourselves in service and i'm very happy to read you've enjoyed your stay. Hopefully we get to welcome you back again in the future!Warmest Regards, Nick HaferGeneral Manager"

"2851",5,"Located right across the street from the Space Needle. The complementary breakfast buffet was excellent and much better than the Residence Inn hotels. There are several restaurants within walking distance for dinner. For the more economical meals, there is also a McDonalds across the street from the hotel. The Duck Boat tours also start from next to McDonalds.The rooms are of decent size and comfortable. They also have a complementary shuttle to the Pier 66 from where NCL ship departed. Will highly recommend it to people and will be my personal choice of stay in Seattle in future as well. The front desk staff is exceptionally polite and helpful (particularly Nate), and so are the shuttle bus drivers. Prices for the hotel are on the high end side, but so are most of the Seattle downtown hotels.ChandraHSGBI,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of our 24 hour shuttle and the complimentary breakfast spread in the morning. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge"
"2852",1,"The old Aztec Hotel on foothill blvd, ( route 66) was a gem, back in its day. Unfortunately for the past ten years while the hotel was under poor management it was never maintained. The entire establishment is dirty and run down. The rooms are very small, which was typical for hotels during that era. Some staff are friendly, others were not willing to help when needed. Bar is a local hangout with a pretty good Band. The property needs a complete overhaul."
"2853",4,"Bad: The room needs to be updated. The bathroom fixtures needs to be renovated. The layout of the room was a little a awkward, there needs to be better lighting and a vanity under the large mirror. The property itself could use use an update as well, it needs to be modernized. Good: It was close to all the activities on Fremont Street. I enjoyed being in the center of Downtown, everything was within walking distance."

"2857",1,"Noisy hotel, paper thin walls and not conducive to sleep. We stayed here because it was near the hospital and we heard they offered a special rate for hospital patients. We were not offered a discount rate and got no sleep before surgery either! Hippy dog in halls at 2 am, car traffic late night and early morning, dark surroundings with little security are reasons why we will never stay here again. Also, no smoking room reeked of smoke especially when bathroom fan was turned on. Morning receptionist did nothing to resolve."

First off the staff ---every single staff member--- was helpful, courteous and went out of their way to go extra mile to make sure our stay was great. The housekeeper even took the time to arrange my kids stuffed animals in fun and creative ways. Second this was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed at. I'm a slight germ a phobe so hotel rooms can bother me. I was so comfortable in the room because it was so clean. Third, the breakfast was good and had a nice variety. Lastly the little touches like the lemon water at foyer, the milk and cookies at 8 each night and the treasure box for the kids at check out all made the stay extra memorable. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Heather"

"2879",5,"There was nothing real close to walk to, but a short cab ride to a lot of places."
"2880",3,"Checking in was the worst part of my experience. As I was standing in line to check in, there was one person in front of me who was being assisted and two other guests in line behind me also waiting to check in with only one front desk employee. I was in line for 7 minutes and never did the lady at the front desk make eye contact with me or signal her customer to hold on while she got some other employees to assist her. It was rude, unprofessional and totally unacceptable from any hotel of thus caliber. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should wait before being acknowledged. Clearly the staff needs better training. That frustration aside, at approximately 6pm I ran into a friend from back home who was waiting for her room. She arrived at 4 and had been relegated to wait at the bar because there were no rooms available to honor her reservation. She had theater tickets and needed her room, so at her behest I inquired to the manager about its status. The manager was apologetic but couldn't guarantee when the room would become available. In the end it all worked out, but the my being neglected at check-in and her room not being ready are two things that you should never experience at a hotel like the St. Regis. Yes the rooms are nice, yes the hotel is well maintained, but the service is for me the most important, and the service that I experienced was slightly below average. Dear Billy R, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback following your stay with us at The St. Regis New York. We strive to provide world-class service to each and every guest during his or her time with us, and regret to discover that we have failed to meet the high standard we set for ourselves while you visited our landmark hotel.After reading your feedback, we will be sure to address the issues that arose during your stay as to offer the best experience possible to future guests, of which we hope you will be one. We welcome the opportunity to discuss additional thoughts on your stay as to best address the complaint you raised moving forward. Please contact me at Octavia.margineanstregis.com.

"2905",4,"Absolutely like the laminate floors in the rooms instead of carpeting. You can sense clean instead of what can be in carpeting. Rooms are pretty standard fare but not cramped. Fairly quiet area - off the interstate a slight distance but not out of the way with good connecting north south state highways. Staff did everything to make the stay... More"

"2907",5,"After a weeks tour from San Francisco driving then all the way down the coast this was the perfect resting place for our final week. The rooms were spacious a beautiful bathroom with full size toiletries ( I was delighted as my pet hate is having to ask for replacements when you are staying in the hotel for several nights)....

"2908",5,"We were at the hotel for our spring break for two nights. The staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel room was clean and specious. The evening reception and breakfast were great.

"2911",4,"Stayed on the third floor. Very quiet. Pool and pool area clean. Breakfast met our needs. Staff friendly. Beds comfortable. Some stains in carpet, but overall cleanliness was very good. Thank you Ric!"
"2912",4,"I was bitten by something in the room and when I brought it to the attention of the staff it was minimized by general manager. Poor customer service when initially I wasn't asking for a refund or any compensation. I now will go to the doctor and have them tell them that they are some type of insect bites."
"2913",2,"The room was what you pay for. It reeked of smoke and the Internet was weak and intermittent. The staff was friendly and they have a continental breakfast. Close to the Opry Mills Mall and lots of food options."
"2914",3,"Fine"
"2915",2,"Not good, suppose to be there a freg. and microwave but I suffered and I have two kids."
"2916",3,"was ok ---"
"2917",4,"Great location. A lot of hidden fee's but still a better bargain than most."
"2918",3,"It would be really nice if when a hotel is under construction, that is stated before it is booked so we can then make a decision if we want to deal with it or not. It really is not a surprise you want when you get there. When I walked into my room there were caulk guns on the floor and other construction materials laying around. How does that get missed when the room is cleaned"
"2919",2,"Wifi was totally non existent! Staff was neither friendly nor unfriendly."
"2920",5,"The beds and pillows were soft and comfy!!! Staff was very friendly! The free continental breakfast was great with lots of choices. They even offered complimentary water with oranges all day to guests. The pool and basketball court are great for kids! We would stay here again for sure!"
"2921",4,"sofa that pulled out to bed was very uncomfortable. Springs were coming thru mattress. We had to get extra comforts to make it sleepable."
"2922",5,"This hotel was recently opened 7 months ago and used to be a bank. The room was clean, spotless and very comfortable. I was traveling in business and it was smack bang in the middle of centre city with easy access to everything. There was a TV in the room with loads of channels to keep you occupied. The shower and toilet were very clean. The only thing I'd say is for the shampoo and shower gel provided to be fragranced..that's just my preference.The staff were get polite esp Walter and Troy..thanks boys for making my stay welcoming..it was great to chat with you guys and sorry I didn't get to say goodbye properly. I can't comment on breakfast or food as I didn't have this and I don't drink so cannot comment on the bar.Lastly the vibe was really nice and Noamaan, Now that's a headline! We are shooting for 7 stars but there are rules about what defines star or diamond level. Those ratings are related to amenities instead of service. That's why we love TripAdvisor! It provides real stories about real experiences in hotels. Thanks for sharing yours. We appreciate the 5 star review. I will share the shout outs with Walter and Troy, though I suspect they're watching too...Hope to have you back soon!"
"2923",5,"What can I say - this is trip 4 to Carroll Motel Cottages and we seem to fall in love with the place more each year.

"2925",4,"Just stayed one night for the nearby wrestling show. Hotel was undergoing a MASSIVE remodel but the room was still nice and slept very comfortably. Breakfast was very good as well. This place seems like it will be very very nice once the remodel is complete."
"2926",5,"Went here with the family in June of 2011. It's a beautiful hotel with lots of nice touches in the rooms: AC, ceiling fans, glass accordion doors that open to the lanai, full kitchen and washer/dryer. The kids enjoyed swimming in many pools and the great snorkeling on the beach. We chose a mountain view room to save on costs... More"
"2927",4,"Wanted to stay an extra night saw cheaper price online. Operated I called from room at front desk was not overly helpful in making sure I got the best price so we checked out instead"
"2928",5,"The only negative thing I have to say is that when our room was cleaned & new condiments where left for us, not everything was replenished. But that is a very minor thing so I would say the overall stay/service was exceptional."
"2929",4,"This hotel almost exactly met my expectations. It's huge, has a beautiful setting, wonderful landscaping, and all the amenities you would expect from a giant resort. Also though, as you would expect from a mega resort, there is little personal attention, flexibility, and a general lack of attention to detail. We had an awesome room, Deluxe Ocean Suite, and would... More"
"2930",4,"Came to life in color and they charged me 50 because we got a little paint on the shower curtain on towels. No where else. If there is going to be an event like that within 2 miles of your hotel and you put a special price on your hotel that weekend, you have to expect people who attend the event will go to your hotel. 50 is extravagant for a little paint. Also, no parking garage Or else we couldn't find one and got charged another 50 for a garage down the street for ONE NIGHT."
"2931",4,"Nice hotel and a weird location, really not near anything. They d ok have a bar and small restaurant. Comfortable hotel, was clean and nice staff. I would stay here again. Good value for the area. It was also very quiet here."
"2932",2,"Bad: The first room - AC not working. No hot water in bathroom. The second room - was not totally cleaned. Leftover shampoo, conditioner, and soap were found in tub area. AC is noisy."
"2933",1,"Room smelled musty, carpets and bedding had a sticky feel. Pool out of order. Keep driving and don't stop here."
"2934",4,"My 18 year old nephew and I recently spent 3 nights at Courtyard-Lake Union. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was especially helpful and friendly. They accommodated a connecting room request (even with a late arrival), helped schedule a whale watching tour and overall very friendly. The rooms were very nice, clean, and well maintained. The surrounding area has a lot of construction currently but other than that the location is great. It is within walking distance of the Space Needle. I would definitely choose this hotel again."
"2935",4,"This hotel is in a great location. It is close to many restaurants, and a short walk to the beach. I enjoyed my stay here very much and would stay here again. The only drawback is parking. There is certainly not enough!"
"2936",5,"Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel was extremely clean and well laid out. Room was very spacious. Could use a little more lighting in the room. In a nice area and very close to University of Maryland, College Park."
"2937",5,"This hotel impresses from start to finish. From the moment you arrive, the courteous staff greets you and assists you in every way possible. The rooms are adorable with a nautical theme.

"2940",5,"The hotel was great! The check in/out was quick and simple. The employees at every level were very courteous. The restaurant in the hotel had great food. Rooms were very clean and had a great view of the ocean. The amenities were great. The hotel was located near great shopping and seafood restaurants. I will stay here again for all of my future vacations to Virginia Beach."
"2941",4,"We received two free weekend nights from Suncoast. Our room was spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable. Whenever we saw an employee they greeted us and were willing to assist! We had to book an extra night and it was very reasonable. I experienced Pure Spa which is on site. WOW! They offered a great combo spa treatment which was to die for! The buffet resturant was also better then expected. Usually buffets are pretty boring but theirs was actually pretty good!"
"2942",5,"WE had an outstanding time enjoying the beauty of this resort and all the activities. Our rooms were furnished with interesting and New Hampshire like settings. The staff was very accommodating and we enjoyed the welcome wine reception."

Checked in and was upgraded to a suite, nice but was a little worried after finding they were at the front of the hotel, no problems the bedroom was at the rear... More"
"2944",5,"The hotel did not have to room I reserved. So I was bribed with free breakfast and free parking. Although it was a nice jester it still doesn't make up for me being placed in a room that did not accommodate my party. I booked 30 days in advance yet these people saw it fit to check other people into those rooms knowing that they had other guests arriving that booked the same room. A guest behind me was told the same thing. The staff was incredibly nice and graceful buy, I guess you have to when greedy corporations overbook hotels and leave them to deal with the customers."
"2945",5,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. This was our second trip to Chicago, but our first at The River Hotel. The room was small, but the dcor and the view made up for it. The staff was very friendly, not a single person passed us without saying hello and asking us how we were. The concierge desk was fantastic! Tim was amazing, his recommendations were spot on, he helped us with directions, whether it was taking the train, a bus or walking. It was refreshing to have the help when you are travelling. Roman was also very helpful. We will definitely be staying here again."
"2946",4,"Services were good, room clean. Good location. We visited universal studios and used a rental car. The drive was around 15-20 minutes. Hotel very close to all amenities. If needed will definitely stay again."
"2947",5,"This is a lovely property. It would be ideal for a romantic getaway. But it was nice for business as well. The staff is very nice and very accommodating. It was not very busy considering it was February. This hotel is away from everything. You will eat and drink here the entire time unless you want to drive 30 min.... More"

"2951",5,"This was our 2nd time staying at this Hampton Inn. Both times we have had a great experience! We always stay in King suite. The price is reasonable per night, esp. if you are a Hilton HHonors member a AAA member, but if not, you'll still get a great price. You will not be dis-satisfied."
"2952",4,"My brother stayed here in October, so when we decided to come to Laughlin again to catch the NFL Championship games, we picked the Belle again. Colorado Belle itself doesn't have it's own sportsbook (you need to place your bets at the Edgewater, just next door) but what it does have are decent rooms at usually the lowest prices... More"
"2953",3,"Not in the greatest area, but cant complain about the price per night. Hotel has been renovated, but has thin walls and has shaired doors with the rooms next door causing lots of the sounds to come from underneath. The doors are sturdy and solid, but makes a lot of noise when they close. Hotel is very close to the Amtrak and metro station, shuttles arived 10 min late but is available"
"2954",5,"This motel was close to the airport and only a short drive from a shopping mall and many fine restaurants. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The whole facility was very well kept and having cold, fruit flavored water available in the lobby was very refreshing in hot July. We would certainly stay here again."
"2955",5,"The hotel was busy with a softball tournament, but our room was quiet. Breakfast was good."
"2956",5,"Great little getaway for our anniversary. Bed was comfortable, staff very nice and friendly, room very clean. Would stay again soon."
"2957",5,"The lady at the front desk was a bit rude. The gentleman that was there later in the evening was a blessing."
"2958",1,"The hotel is not bad. Staff is friendly. We have stayed at several times. This year we purchased park and fly package and left our car there while away on vacation. We returned to the hotel to find the vehicle had been broken into. The driver's side window had been shattered and someone tried to rip the door handle off. The hotel did cover the hole. We had to find a vacumn and vacumn the vehicle. Hotel did not offer. Had to drive 5 hours home without window through cold temperatures and some rain. They did call the police department. They came out took pictures etc. hotel apologized and refunded our room for the one night park and fly. Needless to say we will not be staying here again. We appreciate hearing from our guests and thank you for your feedback. We were very disappointed to hear your car was broken into while in our gated parking lot and understand how frustrating this is. Unfortunately, there has been a recent wave of car break-ins around the airport, affecting a number of hotels in the area. In the case of a car break-in, we contact and hand over to the local police department for further investigation. Fortunately with the help of local police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we have been able to stop the vandalism. We work diligently to create a safe environment for our guests and will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe. We offer our sincerest apologies and are glad we had a chance to discuss the situation with you directly. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know and we are happy to be of assistance."

"2961",3,"Hesitant to book after reading reviews but turned out good. Staff very nice. Room clean and spacious. Bed was comfortable with clean sheets. Don't know why people complained about the continental breakfast. They had cereal, waffles, muffins, good coffee, juice, etc. in a clean environment. The complainers need to realize this is not a bed breakfast or a gourmet restaurant. Had a first floor room and could hear upstairs foot falls but that is to be expected in any motel. Good thing no noisy people tho. Second night rate (Saturday) was way overpriced for this place. Would recommend if only staying a few days. This motel is just a plain vanilla."
"2962",5,"Exceptional stay. Was only 1 night, but nice little hidden gem here. It's actually condo setup that requires lock box code from office. Easy check in, fully kitchen was very nice pool awesome. Very nice stay overall!"
"2963",5,"We always use Hyatt for all inclusive vacations but this time traveling through the US we decided to try Hyatt House. We were traveling with our 2 dogs - we were a little taken back by the non-refundable pet fee of 75 for nights 1-7, we were only staying one night and thought this was a little steep. However, after checking in and seeing the cleanliness of our room, being a pet friendly room you expect to find at least one sign another dog had been there - Nope! Immaculate! Great cleaning staff! This location is very convenient and we will stay here again. The hot breakfast was delicious. The staff very accommodating. Nice place all the way around. 5 stars!"
"2964",5,"This hotel gives you what you would expect from Holiday Inn Express clean comfortable quiet rooms, friendly staff, breakfast good including hot and cold selections, fresh fruit. Nice pool and hot tub"
"2965",3,"We were there for only 8 hours, but it was convenient and good for a quick sleep. Was thrown off by the 10 charge for the pet, when it wasn't mentioned in the reservation process. We were told pets were welcome, but no additional charge. We had some rambunctious neighbors, and the office took care of the issue as soon as we called down to the office, so that was great!"
"2966",1,"This is the motel that began my boycott of all Motel 6's. Two obviously drunk people asked me for a ride and I said no, so they got belligerent. I made my way to the office to report them and they followed me. They waited for me for over half an hour outside the office, yelling profanities and threatening to... More"

"2979",4,"Just a quick one night stop over for our family. But the beds were very comfortable, and the hotel in general felt recently renovated and nice. The staff was very friendly. There was more noise than I'm used to at hotels from people walking around in the room above us and people slamming the doors in the hallway early in the morning. Some minor things that didn't bother us in this one night stayover, but maybe in a longer stay, we were missing a microwave in our room and either a large picture or mirror on the wall as there were metal picture hanging brackets and nothing on them."
"2980",3,"Facility was in good shape and clean. A little awkward to get to. NO ELEVATOR! The room was spacious. Having said that some of that space should have been invested in the bathroom. The sink is outside the bath, next to the door. Once in the bath you need to stand between the toilet and tub to shut the door!... More"

"2983",5,"Spent 9 days at Embassy Suites while visiting family and sight-seeing. Short walk to Metro and access to all areas of DC made sight-seeing easy. Appreciated the full breakfast every morning and evening happy hour at end of day. Bed was comfortable room was clean and quiet small kitchenette was useful. Hotel shuttle to area restaurants also appreciated."
"2984",4,"Spent a few days in Napa, and found this very clean and comfortable. A little distracted by road noise in the morning, weekdays, and not a huge fan of Denny's, the attached food venue. But really impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel, and friendliness of the staff.Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again."
"2985",5,"i really like this place. The food was quite good and the service is very nice. They have a shuttle that works very well for short trips. All in all - it is a motel that has been refurbished, but the rear part is actually quite nice and the rooms are big and quiet. I'd definitely stay here again."
"2986",5,"Had a great time"
"2987",4,"We enjoy HGI, but found the beds to be very uncomfortable- first time that has ever happened at a HGI. The beds were so soft you sunk so low that you could barely roll over without climbing out of the hole you were in."

"3003",3,"We stayed a Friday to Monday and was a little put off by the Club music coming from the bar attached to the lobby but overall it was a nice stay. I loved how relaxed they were at the pool area so we could enjoy ourselves instead of feeling gawlked at. It must be a state law but I found it odd they had a lifeguard on duty for such a small pool but he was cool and pretty much stayed to himself the whole time. I didn't like the area and it was a hassle to get on the highway. I probably wouldn't stay there again but I didn't have a bad experience."

"3005",5,"My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel."

"3040",1,"My girlfriends and I booked the sheraton for our weekend trip to Miami.. The hotel did not get our booking correct, we were not give a balcony room although we had booked one. They would not accommodate our requests to move to a balcony room and stated the entire hotel was sold out, so we sucked it up and went to the standard double room. Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good. I'd spend a little bit more of the money and stay elsewhere."

We were glad that we picked Napa, it is a pretty and very manageable town and this hotel was very good. I thought that it might be a bit far out but it is not. Napa is very small and it is only a few minutes to drive to the central area where there are lots of great restaurants and shops. My husband walked it in the mornings. There are much pricier hotels than this one further out from the town centre.The room that we had was freshly reno'd and was large, clean and had a comfortable bed with nice linens. The only thing that we found a bit strange is what they call a balcony... it is an enclosure with a hole cut in it. We had a room looking out over the pool, but you can't see anything sitting on the balcony.The staff were very helpful and gave us great advice and suggestions each morning before we set out. The breakfast is at Denny's so you can get a big breakfast or get a something smaller and take the 5 credit.The pool and hot tub were small but nice at the end of the day. Would recommend this hotel.We are glad you had a Great Stay. Come back and stay with us on your next visit to Napa."

The second room was appeared clean however it still smelled like cigarette smoke. The only good thing about this hotel was the beds were comfy and the hot water lasted long enough for my family of four to take showers. continental breakfast was alright, but it was complimentary so, I cant complain.

"3122",4,"This is a lovely hotel where one is made to feel very welcome. An extra bonus (for cat lovers, at least) is Claire, the resident cat. The hotel is ideally located for exploring the utterly charming French Quarter. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable but as this is an old building, it is not very soundproof and other guests talking in the courtyard and entryway and wheeling their luggage around disturbed us early each morning - at 4am during the first night. The Frette linens and Molton Brown toiletries were much appreciated luxury touches. We were however disappointed by the breakfast - we ordered toast in preference to biscuits and one slice of toast each seemed rather meagre. Be warned - the coffee is flavoured with chicory - a New Orleans tradition but not to our taste. I would recommend this as a place to stay if you are happy to put up with the quirks of an old building but suggest eating breakfast elsewhere.We usually do have pure coffee in the freezer. We don't get many requests but we try to stay prepared. You simply needed to request it. I doubt that anyone could find breakfast spots in New Orleans that serve pure coffee. New Orleans traditional caf au lait is French roasted chicory coffee served with an equal part of warm milk. That is what we serve. That is what Caf du Monde serves. We are famous for our buttermilk biscuits but we do keep gluten free and whole grain bread for the guests who don't eat white flour. I do apologize that you were served only two slices of toast. An order of biscuits if four therefore an order of toast should also be at least four.Please if your travels bring you back to New Orleans give us another try. In addition to the tea , hot chocolate and iced coffee that are always available we will brew pure for you each morning. We will also give you a room on the second or third floor or even on the other side of the street so if we have late arrivals or early departures you won't be disturbed.Claire would be disappointed if you went elsewhere and so would I"

"3124",3,"Short overnight stay. The staff was great. Very friendly and welcoming. The hotel is a bit dated and in need of a few fixes. Tub and toilet are is very small. So small the door hit the toilet when closing. Overall this was a nice stay. Bed was comfortable. Lots of room space and dog friendly. I would stay here again."

No apologies, just stated we already offer the lowest price rate, and I can't do anything about it I thought I would take a chance since I was there for 1 night after reading reviews. My advice DON'T DO IT!! After a long hard day of work, a hot shower and cable is not expecting too much."
"3128",5,"I had a ball really enjoyed myself!"

The staff (especially Chris at the front desk) with restaurant recommendations and a local florist that delivered flowers that the hotel made sure where in the room when we arrived. Also, the champagne that was waiting with the flowers (charge of 28 but the champagne was great). All of the front desk staff, throughout the weekend, was so accommodating.

"3144",1,"I was told at check in there is a 7.00 per day charge for your vehicle for parking. I did not mind this but it is not explained to you on the information of the hotel when booking. The real problem I had was that I had absolutely no hot water to shower with in the morning when I was getting ready for work. I called the front desk and received NO consideration at all. I am a vietnam veteran and I swore I would never take another cold shower so I had to go to work without bathing. NOT FUN!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for breakfast when I reserved the room but I did not receive any coupon at check in and was not told I needed one. After getting dressed, I went to the breakfast area but was not allowed in because I did not have a coupon. I WAS SO UPSET AT THIS POINT THAT I JUST CHECKED OUT AND LEFT. I expressed my feelings to the front desk and they said they could not do anything for me because no one from mainteanace was at work yet. This all happened between 5:45 AM and 6:30 AM"
"3145",5,"I always try to stay at the Hyatt House whenever I'm in Seattle for business. The rooms are studio apartments and extremely well kept and clean. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The bar / kitchen is open late and the breakfast is pretty good for a free meal. This is not the place for people looking for a luxury experience with a ton of amenities. It's centrally located to Seattle landmarks and if you're lucky you get a view of the Space Needle.Dear JenK Wow! Your header says it all. I am so happy to hear this and that you felt the Hyatt house was exactly what you need. Thank you also for being a repeat guest. Any time we get a 5 star review we celebrate it as a team.

"3146",4,"My wife and I decided to get out of town and take in a Christmas Opryland show. We stayed at the Best Western nearby to avoid the expensive Opryland Hotel. The hotel was good (old but remodeled). The neighborhood was a hotel wasteland--totally not walkable."
"3147",4,"The hotel was up to date very clean. The room was roomy comfortable enough for us to entertain family. Breakfast was wonderful! They had made to order omelets, bacon, fruit, etc which is free. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that someone was smoking marijuana on out floor children were running wild!

"3150",4,"Just stayed for 1 night because a friend was coming in from out of town. Unable to check-in early, but got a call as soon as the room was ready. Room was very clean. Small, but nicely appointed and comfortable. Nice bathroom, aside from some trouble in turning on the cold water for the sink (handle was difficult to turn). It also took a long time for the shower to warm up. Free wifi is excellent in this hotel."
"3151",3,"While this is a very nice hotel I can't say that it is better than others in the area charging a lower price. Considering how much they charge you'd think they at least would offer a continental breakfast.

Stay at this lovely, quiet bay front hotel and drive to the craziness of the oceanfront when you want to go down there. Park in the municipal lot on Pacific and 19th street and you're in the heart of the tourist area. Take you own bikes and simply ride all over the boardwalk....then go back to a quiet comfortable relaxing hotel room."

Then the guy that shuttled us to the airport the next morning was just as friendly. In fact he got off the bus at the airport to unload our luggage and explained step-by-step how to get to the international terminal. Great staff!Breakfast: awesome! Sausage and eggs were delicious. They had so many choices!Room: huge room with great a/c. Two tvs and plenty of storage space. There was some dried soap on the shower wall that probably should have been cleaned before we checked in, but it's just soap, so no big deal. Also worth noting: I never heard an airplane during the night. I was worried that staying so close to the airport would be loud, but it wasn't at all. Park fly parking area is closed off and well-lit. Hopefully my car is safe. If not I'll edit this review to reflect any issues. Cons:We had an issue with the plumbing in our room. We were only there from 8 pm to 6 am so I can't say whether this was ongoing or resolved, but the toilet didn't flush well. Like it was almost backed up, but it would still flush a little. Also, it would be great if the hotel had a luggage scale. I would definitely stay here again! Con"

The hotel itself is elegant and cozy, with a great bar and restaurant, nice outdoor courtyard, great pool and outdoor patio area, and small but nice rooms. Comfortable beds. The bathrooms could use more counter space and towel racks, but are clean and updated. Hotel location is great and is within walking distance to everything. The valet parking is expensive (~$29 a day) which is a pet peeve of mine - I think the parking should always be included. However the valet staff is also very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel."
"3177",4,"The stay was very pleasant, as usual. The breakfast buffet is wonderful and the room was great. I had a corner room and it was particularly large with a coffee table, couch, sitting table and chairs. I also like the addition of the microwave, refrigerator, and the Keurig."

"3179",2,"The lobby was very nice, but that was about it. the room was not at all what you would expect from the description. I had to deodorize the room due to a strange odor, it wasn't horrible but unpleasant. The bed was not comfortable, but was semi-clean other than a well worn sheet. The AC did work very well and the the TV was a recent upgrade, too bad the hotel only had 5 channels to choose from. Overall, I was disappointed with the room and I am thankful I only stayed a single night. I would not stay there again and probably would not stay in a hotel in the surrounding area either."

The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement).

"3207",4,"This hotel's people are friendly and helpful, patient with questions, and easy to deal with. The public areas are well-kept and clean. There was nice selection in the complimentary breakfast. The fitness center, while not large, was well-equipped vs. similar size hotels. I will stay there again the next time I am in the area."

"3211",2,"I have had to stay here quite a few times over the past few years. Staff nice, room clean, nice beds,etc,etc. BUT. Terrible acoustics mean you hear everything. And as they have wedding parties every weekend you have to suffer noise and disruption from wedding guests staying in the hotel. Up until 5am at times. No sleep for me. Smoking and drinking outside the front lobby, and no one to stop them until I phoned at 2am to complain. Where is the noise coming from , I was asked Right in front of you , I said. They need to MANAGE this. Not put non wedding guests on floors with guests, and they should put polite notices up about noise. During the week fine - but avoid the weekend unless you like being kept up all night."
"3212",3,"The 1st night we checked in was the night the crazy storm hit DC. We ended up losing power that night (Fri) and it still hadn't returned as of Mon. While this was by not their fault, it made the stay quite dreadful. We had a busy day on Sat, as we were looking for houses (we're moving to DC) and didn't get back to the hotel until late the hotels with power were sold out. The room was disgusting, so we slept in the car and checked out on Sunday. Apparently, that was a mistake. The girl at the front desk said it shouldn't be a problem to get reimbursed for that night and the pre-paid nights we didn't stay. However, we were told to call the manager, who said that it is not customary for them to refund us for a night in which our things were in the hotel, even though it was miserable and we couldn't sleep there (I should mention that there was record-breaking heat). Ultimately, she refunded us for this night and we were satisfied. Had the power not been an issue, the hotel was pretty nice. The rooms seemed clean and were recently renovated. The staff was really nice too (even though they were hot tired). The location is pretty decent. They are currently working on the orange line though, so it's closed on the weekends at New Carrollton. Fortunately, the Greenbelt stop is about a 10 min drive away and there's free parking on the weekends. Ultimately, I think we just had bad luck and our stay would have been perfectly fine if the power hadn't gone out on day one."

"3216",5,"I thought the hotel was very nice. The staff was wonderful! They were very helpful and friendly. Only thing I did not like was the hotel allowed smoking out in front of the main entrance. It is fine with me if people choose to smoke, but when you are waiting for a shuttle and have about 6 or more people standing around you smoking it is a little uncomfortable for those who do not smoke. The only other thing that I did not like was one day when we were on the shuttle there was a young women already on when we got on. I am not sure if she was an employee of the hotel but it was clear she was not a hotel guest. I do not know your rules on people riding your shuttle but here is what the problem was this women took up 2 seats - the shuttle was full and people, guest of the hotel, had to stand. If she was not a guest of the hotel (which from her conversation with the driver I am guessing she was not) the drive should of had her stand so that people who paid to stay at the hotel could be seated. If she was an employee of the hotel she needed to move over to allow a guest to sit with her and not take up two seats. That was a little disappointing but that being said the shuttle service was great. Right on time every day you have to love that! It was my son's first time to D.C. thank you for making it a great trip."

"3226",4,"My sister I were only in town for a day so we didn't need a lot of service when we were at the hotel. However, it did meet our requirements. The room was very clean, the woman at the front desk was polite professional when we checked in. We were very pleased with our short little stay. All we every ask is that the rooms are clean, the staff is respectful, it to be quiet. I will say that there were a lot of children. I don't know if this hotel is a vacation destination hotel because the amount of children was a little daunting. Granted, it is summer they do have a pool. The halls were still fairly quiet while we were on our way to check out, the room next to ours had a bunch of children in it we never had a problem with the noise level so I think it's safe to say the walls are pretty thick."
"3227",4,"Bad: The only disadvantage is lack of elevator, however it's quite common in Ar Deco hotels. However you could ask for ground floor room. Good: I loved staying there. The hotel located between 4th and 3d streets. It's quiet part of seashore, there was much less noise than at Ocean drive. 5-7 min to the beach. Good wi-fi. Reasoable breakfast with cereals and cookies."

"3233",5,"Had a great stay, however no real complaints. I'm very picky with where I stay. The staff was beyond friendly, the hotel was well kept. They even had snacks when you enter and leave the hotel at the front door. Was very pleased. The only small issue was that the carpet in the room needed shampooing. I normally bring my slippers and forgot this time. Carpet had hair on floor needs better vacuuming and shampoo the walls in the room need touch up paint. It would literally take 20 min for when a quest leaves for walls to be touched up every so often. That was my only issue looking at a dirty wall. However I would stay again. Why are the racks for the towels inside the shower on the wall. Bad idea makes them get damp when you shower."

"3241",3,"This hotel is ok if you need a short stay, mostly for sleeping. I stayed two nights, using the swimming pool once. Cons: The breakfast buffet was of mediocre quality (worst is the pastry, tasteless and more like stale bread) The lobby was hot and humid, and could have been cleaner and neater The path to the swimming pool was horrible, filthy, flooded The pool itself is ok, warm, its floor littered with stuff - there is no change room or shower in the pool area Pros WiFi was of good quality, fast and no issue with login or usage Staff were friendly, helpful The bedroom and the bathroom were clean and neat The fridge and all lighting worked well"

"3251",5,"We spent four days at this hotel and it was a good experience. We wanted to visit Napa Valley but many on the inns and hotels are very expensive. We certainly were not planning to spend much time at the hotel and just wanted something comfortable and convenient. It is located a 5 minute drive from downtown Napa and 10 minutes away from the Wine Train Station. There are many things nearby if you need stuff. There is a Dennys next to the hotel and a Target, Applebees, IHOP and many more fast food restaurants just across the road. Since we were traveling with kids it was good to have different options. The hotel is very basic but well-kept. The rooms are big and comfortable and so is the bathroom. There is a tiny pool and hot tub outside. The kids liked that. We enjoyed our experience there.We are very happy that you, our world travlers from China, enjoyed your stay with us. If you ever get back to Napa we look foward to being your home away from home again."

"3253",3,"Overall great stay, rooms are small but cozy ... great fire place near bar to sit and drink wine. Staff was good except this one lady (I may go to extent of calling her border line racist), the reason: we were travelling to Lake Tahoe and asked hotel staff that can we leave our extra luggage at our check out and pick it up once we are back, we were told yes we can but on the day we were leaving she told us they will not, we told her that you guys said you can ... so what has changed to that she did not have any answer. It was a very bad experience and significantly delayed our travel to Lake Tahoe while trying to figure out what to do with extra luggage."

"3256",2,"We had two rooms for the weekend and we may have just been there on a bad weekend or something because we planned on leaving around 830 on sunday morning and upon waking up there was no hot water, one of the rooms air conditioning units had stopped working in the middle of the night and it was a humid evening, so we went to the continental breakfast to find no toaster and stale fruit loops. Hot water was available but not until about 1030 so we were about 3 hours behind schedule when all is said and done and we had to stop and grab some breakfast."
"3257",5,"The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect."
"3258",3,"Disappointed with the breakfast, have to wait for food, was too slow"
"3259",5,"As always, extremely satisfied with my stay at Hilton Hotels, great quality and customer service! The price is afforable, well worth it for the luxury and quality of the hotel and amenities. I will recommend this Hotel to anyone."

"3264",5,"I'm so impressed. I got in late last night, and needed a cab early in the morning, and needed on time. The person I spoke with at the desk confirmed they'd have it there when needed (and I'm sure she meant to, she was very helpful). Well, staff changed overnight and the message didn't get passed on, and even if it had, apparently they're not supposed to do that, I should have called in the morning. When the car wasn't there, I was frustrated. The person I spoke with was very apologetic and tried to help, but when I realized what happened I just immediately booked an uber, and left very disappointed. Things like this are mistakes, no hotel (or person for that matter) is above an occasional mistake, but how it's handled makes all the difference. Tonight I got a personal email from their operations manager apologizing again, which was totally unexpected, and very appreciated. As if that wasn't enough, he also credited me a bunch of Marriott Rewards points in an effort to go the extra mile. Wow. I was amazed! I've had bigger things than this happen, and have just been told basically tough luck. They didn't have to do anything and they did. You could see a small hotel really caring about my experience, but generally I wouldn't expect it from a large chain (or the LARGEST in the world for that matter). My trust is higher now than it was before I checked in. Thank you. Definitely Redeemed. Other than that, normal courtyard, great."

"3267",4,"Very nice staff. (They must have fired all the the rude people I read about in the reviews. LOL) Safe area (for New Orleans. For the people who said it was in a bad neighborhood, this is not Mayberry. ) The cost was a bit excessive in my opinion. Over 250 for one night ( although that did include parking. and it was an event weekend.) The facilities are nice. You can sit on the wrought iron balcony and watch the French Quarter wake up. The location is convenient and close to everything. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that the shower was dirty. For that kind of money, I at least want to wash my old behind in a clean shower. The bed was VERY FIRM. It was too firm for my wife and me, but I hear some people like firm mattresses, so this would be right up your ally if you do. The second floor seems to be the best as far as views, I think. Third floor could be a beating on older folks because of the stairs. Also, there are two seperate hotels. I saw where a lady was complaining about having to walk from the office to another building. This is because she went to the wrong one, initially. There is French Quarter Suites, and New Orleans Courtyard Hotel. I think the NO Courtyard is a little higher end. Overall good experience. I will be back, but not on an event weekend."
"3268",4,"The hotel did not seem like it was in a good neighbourhood but the rooms were nice and comfortable. Breakfast was good but served in plastic plates and cutlery. The breakfast buffet had a nice choice of food, yoghurts and similar. The check in was easy and fast, staff was nice."
"3269",5,"Bad: Was a bit pricey, but may be that was the season and the timing (March 17, it was a music festival at Miami Beach). Good: Very clean and stylish. Very helpful staff."
"3270",5,"I'm very happy with that particular hotel! The room was very neat and clean, staff very friendly and willing to help in anyway possible. The frontdesk employee gets 10 out of 10 points for friendliness and service. It's convinient location will suit anyone nomatter if you're travelling for business or for pleasure. I would highly recommend Days Inn Glen Burnie to everyone who is looking to stretch their vacation dollar and yet have fun and comfort of a higher class hotel!"

On a positive note, the bed was comfortable and the bedding was cozy."

"3278",5,"We stayed in a two bedroom apartment during our stay in Anaheim in June 2004. We have two young children (3 and 5). The apartment was clean and well equipped. The beds were comfy and the linen fresh. We loved the location, near Dennys, Starbucks, Panda Express and Mc Donalds. We made our booking on the net from Australia and found our requests had been answered perfectly. ( A corner non-smoking room). Another great feature was the free parking and free shuttle to Disneyland. There were three T.V.'s all having cable, which the kids loved. There was a bath, lots of towels. I highly recommend this hotel to families with young children, we were very impressed."

We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district.If you're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your roomThe rooms were clean and thats really most important.When we arrived at 1230pm we were able to check in.We were told we could valet park for 36.00 or for 20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street.We opted for the 20.00 option. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!!My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it.Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back.The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time.After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel.We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great.Im glad we stayed here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave."

"3285",2,"This hotel needed to be renovated 5 years ago. It is very tired and kept poorly. Mildew in corners of tub, poor bath amenties and so so cleaning of rooms. The high speed internet that they charge you 9.95 for is a total joke - super slow and almost unusable. As a business traveler, I would never stay here again."
"3286",4,"I stayed here for four nights as I attended a conference in downtown Louisville. This was the only reasonably priced hotel in downtown. It's actually more of a motel. The rooms were decent, the breakfast was basic but included, and the location was definitely worth it."

The staff was helpful and friendly, housekeeping did a great job and the breakfast staff was great. I couldn't have asked for a better stay!Thank you for your review of the Hampton Inn in Gloucester. We are delighted that your stay was so pleasant. Looking forward to your return!"

"3290",4,"Good stay"
"3291",4,"We loved the pink hotel and will definitely be going back! It was clean, well furnished and the bed and bedding was heavenly!! Crisp white sheets with billowy comfort.

"3292",4,"Located right next to Highway 2 in superior , Rooms are nice with updated HVAC units through the wall. Water is good , Beds are well less than okay. In need of replacing .. rates are sub par for what your getting.. they lack technology ( reservations which is what im assuming happend to the previous person ) service is alright .. however if you are in a smoking room dont open your windows they assume you have the heat on all the time and bug you about it like crazy. In the 2 weeks we s...view moretayed they were calling us almost daily its annoying your treated like a child !, Aside from all that ive seen some bad motels and this one lives up to what motels should be , inexpensive , but still decent ... just look past the olive green and enjoy the massive water pressure in the shower ( really it sounds and feels like a water fall ! it has to be like 5GPM )view less"
"3293",4,"As a regular Best Western guest, there comes a time to also comment on just plain helpful and good people, not just the room. The review is about the front desk clerk, who assisted us in our struggle to find directions at 1 in the morning....to the Philadelphia Airport. I regret I do not have his name, but he was... More"
"3294",2,"When this hotel first opened I adored it. I visited regularly and it became the benchmark of what a brilliant hotel should be. The decor was magnificent, the staff attentive and the little quirks throughout the hotel (including free calls to the UK), really made for a 5 star experience. My recent stay however, not so, and that's because the... More"
"3295",3,"Clean, but bed was very uncomfortable. They forgot to put a shower curtin on our shower so I had to call management in the morning to get it put on. Heater didnt put out very hot heat. Bed was bad, woke up with back pain."
"3296",1,"Absolutely rude front desk clerk. We arrived at 5pm and this lady clerk was condescending and positively RUDE.............So rude we cancelled our stay at this place to stay at the Best Western. Stear clear."
"3297",3,"The price was really good, but I was disappointed when I checked in and they did not have the room I booked. I booked a king and all they could give me was two doubles. They said I could move the next day, but I decided to stay in my same room rather than packing everything back up again. The room was definitely in need of some maintenance, but nothing major. I would stay there again, as long as I get the room I actually book next time."
"3298",5,"From check-in until check-out, this was a fantastic experience. The room was clean, the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff were amazing. I will definitely stay with Home2 Suites by Hilton again!"
"3299",3,"The lobby and breakfast area were very nice and clean. The girl at the desk was very friendly. However my non smoking room reaked of smoke and we found a container of chewing tobacco in the bedside table. My three-year-old also pulled out two 2 x 4 is from underneath the bed. The bathroom was clean."
"3300",2,"Ask for disabled room on bottom floor. Booked through expedia,never again. Put on 2nd floor, only 1 of the elevators went to 2nd.told by staff to send other elevator to top floor so we could get the correct one to open. Ice machine not on our floor. Rooms were old and smelled musty."
"3301",4,"We stayed at Best Western in DeRidder, LA as a group with a baseball team for a tournament. It was a nice place to stay and convenient location to where we needed to go. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff was really helpful and nice."
"3302",2,"Location wise it's not bad but this hotel is in need of some renovations. On my visit which was on super bowl weekend only one of the elevators was working. As well on two of the five nights the fire alarm went off with no voice commands over the intercom. The fire doors would close automatically and during the week... More"
"3303",4,"The staff was extremely accommodating whenever we needed. The room was clean and pleasant. The location was within walking distance to several great venues. Not having been in Atlanta before we had a hard time locating the entrance for checking in however."
"3304",5,"Looking for a place to stay while in the Oklahoma City area---you couldn't do much more in Moore than to choose the Best Western motel Plus. It is in the middle between OKC Norman and in the midst of most name brand eateries. The staff was very friendly Helpful most helpful."
"3305",2,"Our room smelled like cigarette and it was dingy! Thankfully the manager was willing to give us a new room and upgraded to a suite. I think ALL the carpet needs to be replaced in all the rooms. This place should be categorized as a motel, not a hotel. Staff was nice though."
"3306",4,"Great little motel that makes a real effort both is the motel and in the welcome. the staff are very friendly and have a lot of knowledge of the local area. They also displayed a lot of tact when someone asked them where the staircase was..... Rooms are clean, beds are really comfy and the landscaping is excellent. The views... More"

"3308",2,"It needs to be renovated."
"3309",4,"You get what you pay for. The staff was terrific. The rooms need updating. Carpet was a bit worn. The breakfast was so so. Overall the place was clean and a bargain for the price. We would stay there again if in the area."

"3311",5,"I got a super deal at this Hotel some time ago and was blown away. The lobby is stunningly beautiful, as lovely as any lobby I have visited at any Hotel in the lower 48.

"3316",5,"We had an excellent time. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our rooms and the hotel were very clean. My wife is the type who lifts the sheets and mattress pad to check the mattress.

"3317",5,"Well situated near magic mile for shopping and walking distance from the loop. CTA station pretty close to hotel."
"3318",5,"Bad: Nothing, I cherished my stay here. Good: This is a gorgeous little hotel on ocean drive, 200 yards from the busy beach front, just far enough for it to be quiet through the night, the veiw from the rooftop pool was exquisite, the rooms and the restaurant were also of the highest standard. Loved it"
"3319",2,"I was very disappointed in this hotel. It was not what I expected since it was to be renovated. It took me about 20 minutes to find the entrance. I arrived late at time and a sign with a red background and red lettering was not a good thing. When you add in poor lighting, it definitely was not a good mix. When I checked in there were a few peopled in the lobby and outside. this raised safety concerns. I obtain my keys and receive directions to my room. Again, more people hanging outside. I enter the room and realized the mistake I made. The room was very small with no iron, ironing board or coffeemaker (most hotels provide these basic items). I read the booklet and I learned to enjoy these benefits, I would have to upgrade which I began to think it wouldn't be worth it. The next morning I left the room and there was woman sitting outside in a lawn chair. I returned 3 hours later and she was still there. If it couldn't get worse, when I returned later that night, two men were sitting outside a room, in lounge chairs, music playing and a small grill on the grass. At this point I was relieved that I was leaving in the morning and this would be a distant memory very quickly."
"3320",5,"My husband and I are here for a vacation. The fishing and weather has not been the greatest but this resort is. Clean cabin. Great looking pool. Very close to town.

"3324",5,"This was our first time staying at Aloft. The hotel is very clean and secure. The bed was amazing and made it hard to go out and explore. Conveniently located blocks away from the french quarter. They also give you coupons if you choose not to have your room cleaned. The Make a Green Choice program is great, especially for those of us who don't prefer our room be cleaned anyway. Thanks for the kudos, see you next time!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"3325",4,"Bad: That the tv would not switch to the input channel. I wasn't able to use the HDMI port on the TV. Good: The company I had with me. Lol"
"3326",5,"Bad: The bed/mattress was not as firm as I like. Good: The hotel staff was incredibly attentive and sent us a bottle or Prosseco and chocolate covered strawberries to help celebrate our anniversary. It was such a welcome surprise that really made our stay special. We also appreciated the drink tokens and lounge area with appetizers- made it very comfortable to stay there!"
"3327",3,"Hotel is basic clean with comfortable. Front desk clerk was helpful beyond my expectations. Nearby advertised restaurant was closed Sunday evening when we arrived and when we left Monday am ... disappointing."

"3332",3,"The service was pretty awful. Check in took way too long - only one person at front desk who was extremely slow. Requested cab in AM and staff was unable to secure - got own Uber instead. Arrived back at hotel at 6PM last day of stay and room was being cleaned - unacceptable! We went to the front desk to complain and were offered free drinks at Monkey Board and reassured would be completed soon as well as told that hotel was full - that was why cleaning being done so late - not the customer's issue at all and should not be used as an excuse. Major inconvenience as we had been at French Quarter Fest all day and were planning to rest a little before getting ready for dinner. Also, elevator setup is less than optimal. Big line in lobby to get up to bar interfering with guests trying to get to rooms. Also, didn't seem to be separate service elevator from guest elevator - another dissatisfier. Nice looking hotel - rooms were actually very nice looking/well designed and decent location but really need to get the service kinks out before I would recommend to others and/or return. Lots of other great choices in NOLA....Thank you for your comments Josh, I'm very disappointed to read we didn't exceed your expectations. Your concerns have been shared with my Front Office Manager and Director of Housekeeping so that we can improve. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience and know that we can do much better. We definitely want to earn back your trust and certainly your recommendation. I'll be reaching out to you directly to see how we can do that.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager"
"3333",5,"The staff was amazing and helpful. Very clean and quiet. Room was beautiful. Will highly recommend to anyone."
"3334",4,"Good location to get around on foot and see Chicago. We walked to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, restaurants, etc. The lobby is beautiful. The staff was friendly. Other reviews have complained about city noise (sirens and such) but it was not a problem in my opinion. You hear them, obviously, because you are in the city, but it's not constant."
"3335",1,"Filthy, outdated, noisy neighbours, but this was not the worst. We were nearly eaten by the bed bugs, more agressive than Denali bears. I would not reccomend this hole even to my worst enemy. Next day we needed medical help."

"3341",4,"Hotel looked very nice and modern, rooms are very comfortable and have refrigerators which was great for us to store drinks. Room was very clean and the ammenities were plenty. Only thing is that rooms have LCD's but no HDTV cable, so quality of image was not what it's supposed to be. Check-in/out was very prompt and efficient. Will definitely stay at this hotel again if in DC area."
"3342",5,"All employees were super friendly and accommodating, the rooms are clean, and overall an excellent experience! Would recommend highly. Good value as well. One of the nicer hotels in Anderson. Close to the casino.Thank you so much for your lovely feedback, hope to see you soon."

"3347",3,"Ok, this hotel is s very predictable Express. Clean, accessible to 101, good parking, lots to eat for the included breakfast. For the area, wine country, the room rate is very good.

"3348",5,"Good: The staff is above and beyond friendly, and it's not insincere. Just great personality. Upgraded our room for my gf's birthday, and a complimentary bottle of wine. Nice touch!"
"3349",4,"We stayed one night here. The Naples area is very pricey. We booked a room here via a Priceline special deal for a reasonable rate. Our room was a large suite with 2 beds. The hotel is relatively new and clean. The breakfast exceeded my expectations and probably saved us an additional 35. Overall, a great value!!!!"
"3350",2,"There was nothing major wrong, just several small things. The tv remote battery cover was missing and had been taped, the alarm clock was showing the wrong time and it had no battery cover or batteries, couldn't figure how to set the time. The ceilingabove the bed had a big dark stain, there was a small tear in the couch... More"
"3351",4,"Bad: There is no longer a casino, and the pool is seasonal despite it easily being warm enough to be used. The sauna was also out of action. With the lack of these attractions it becomes a very plain hotel. Good: Staff throughout the hotel are excellent, especially at the bar on the late night shift and on reception. Very friendly people. Hotel well presented, clean and comfortable. Location is great, a short walk to bellagio, Paris etc for those who want to be near the strip but not on it all the time!"

"3353",1,"92.50 for the smallest, dirtiest, hideous,smoke smelling room I've ever stayed in. Management is white trash and extremely rude to customers. There is no reason to ever stay in this hotel, it's garbage and should not be open to the public."

"3357",5,"My wife decided we should stay in Pismo Beach, and this hotel was right on the water, and was completely great. Friendly staff, beautiful room, great views. Excellent continental breakfast, excellent restaurant advice. We were delighted."
"3358",4,"The hotel was great. Getting to the hotel was not so great. The construction on 31 had the gps all screwed up. Not the hotels problem but others should be aware."
"3359",3,"I thought the hotel was clean and comfortable. The woman at the front desk was very pleasant and helpful. We loved the shower"
"3360",5,"Great"
"3361",4,"Bad: key didn't work. Good: helpfulness of staff"
"3362",4,"We were looking for a hotel that was convenient to the Va Beach ampitheater. This fit beautifully for what we were looking for. The only downside was that the sink had dark hair near the rim of the sink (perhaps from a man shaving) that the cleaners must not have been able to see. The staff were helpful in finding a restaurant. The icemaker on our floor did not work but the staff filled our cooler from the icemaker in the kitchen."
"3363",3,"A nice place to stay. I would recommend changing the breakfast menu (it was dried out, pretty tasteless, except for the waffles). One of the 2 elevators was broken, so you had to walk all the way to the other end of the hotel, go to your floor, then walk all tbe way back to your room. The staff, however, are top notch. Going to DC they have a shuttle to the metro. Good value for the price."
"3364",5,"It is rare that a property can fulfill all my travel fantasies...but the Honua Kai delivered even beyond my high expectations.

"3366",5,"Bad: Absolutely nothing!. Good: Such a relaxing hotel in the hub of the city. Breakfast located on each floor next to the lift was great, bed was sooo comfy, bathroom fab and the view stunning. Cocktail hour with nibbles each night was such a nice touch. What makes the Kinzie thou are the staff!"
"3367",4,"Our room was comfortable and clean. The only drawback that we found was that we could not access the internet and the attendant did not know how to remedy the problem. The breakfast was excellent with several options to choose from."
"3368",5,"My family and I enjoyed the cleanliness of the hotel, friendliness of the staff, and convenience of its location. We always stay at Hampton hotels because of their cleanliness and dependable service! We highly recommend the Erie, PA Hampton Inn."
"3369",2,"Location not as convenient as originally thought.  Still had to drive to dinner.  Pool is fairly small and seems a long hike from most rooms.  Very nice lobby, only two clerks for check in at 5:00 on a Saturday.  In the future I'll stay downtown or somewhere else.  Disappointed that Wi-Fi and parking were so expensive.  The parking garage two blocks away was free though."
"3370",3,"Bad: The bathroom is very small, smaller than I am used to. The saimin noodle soup at the cafe was terrible, the noodles were mushy and blend. Good: Location was right. The buffet was so so. The food at the cafe was okay. The rooms are kind of small but okay."
"3371",4,"Came up midweek for a quick break and an Orioles game, so did not spend much time in the hotel. But we were pleased with everything. Prices seemed high all over the area, perhaps because of an event at the convention center, so this was more than expected. But for what we wanted to do -- the aquarium, the ball game, a water taxi ride -- this is a great place to stay."
"3372",3,"It was ok. Was not worth the price but we waited til the last minute to book and that's what you get."
"3373",5,"Good: My kids loved the place with games, billar, virtual reality etc"
"3374",4,"The facility was clean, the staff was friendly, and the breakfast was a perfect start to our day. Usually when they say free breakfast its just continental but there were eggs and sausage and waffles too. The picture of the room is exactly what you get. We even had little towel animals in the bathroom."
"3375",5,"The location of this hotel is hreT for visits to my son. The room was clean and comfortable. I didnt have time to try the breakfast but I hear it's fabulous! I had a great night's sleep in a comfy bed! I will be staying here again."
"3376",4,"Overall a nice place to stay a night or two on your way. Clean rooms, older exterior but considering the rate paid, a good value."
"3377",5,"We stayed for 11 nights and this hotel is absolutely wonderful. We had a king suite with separate bedroom and it was contemporary, comfortable and well-appointed.

"3379",5,"Staff was courteous and room was very clean. Watch out for the 1.50 insurance charge for the room safe. Never seen that one before and did not like that I had to request at checkout that it be removed rather than at check in."
"3380",4,"Good: Very friendly staff. Rental of a beach chair and umbrella was included in the room price."
"3381",3,"We were passing through. After searching trip advisor reviews we chose this hotel because it is pet friendly and we had our tiny dog. The bed was comfy and room reasonably clean. Did not eat breakfast. Not much choice there.Thank you for staying with us! We appreciate your comments and look forward to your next stay. Be sure to follow us on our facebook page, Days Inn of Ellis."
"3382",5,"Last-minute online reservation and it was perfect. Front desk staff gave us a discount after finding out we were military.

Also, less than 5... More"
"3383",4,"There were four people staying in the room. Only had 3 sets of towels. Told the front desk, they said housekeeping would bring another set. Never happened. Saw 1 person from housekeeping in the hall way. I asked for towels, she pointed to her cart down the hall and told me to get my own. Very rude. Also only 1 bench in front for you to be able to go have a cigarette. Could never sit and relax."

"3386",4,"Hotel is in the perfect spot at the perfect price with the not so perfect view. Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!"

"3388",5,"This hotel was great. The staff was genuinely nice and helpful. My boyfriend and I came for a trip to the Verizon Center to catch a Wizards game. The Verizon Center was not far at all. I called front desk for a cab and had one in about 5 minutes. The room was clean and nice. I'm a bit of a germaphobic and I had no problem with it. I didn't spot one dirty spot or anything. When we first got in the room there was a problem with the heat. Maintenance came and fixed it quickly and all was well. If I had to list one improvement it would be that the furniture looks a little outdated. But it was not really a problem. It didn't look dirty or run down, just not fashionable. Other than that, this hotel was wonderful. It was in a great location to restaurants and DC and I would absolutely stay here again."
"3389",3,"I have traveled quite a bit and the resort is at 3 star at best. Upon arrival we had to wait...we were early so okay.

"3405",4,"When we checked in, we had no toiletries due to the strict airline restrictions from Canada, so the clerk at the front desk took care of everything for us with complimentary necessities. We were also given a complimentary appetizer for their restaurant, and were informed that daily happy hours was between 5:30 - 7:30 pm. Our room was really nice, clean and comfortable with updated furnishings. A little more attention to detail could have been made with the cleaning reagarding some marks and soiling on the walls, but nothing to complain about. After having spent over 30 hours travelling, we were very pleased to find that happy hour consisted of our choice of a long list of spirits, beer, and wine (unlimited), as well as tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole - all complimentary. A full breakfast buffet is included, which is as good as anywhere we've ever been. Sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, milk, juice, tea, coffee, bagels, toast, english muffins, sweet buns, fruit, yogurt, and made to order omlette. Lunch and supper in the restaurant was also really good. Some of the best wings I've ever had."
"3406",4,"My first time staying at a Best Western Plus and I was pleasantly surprised. The employees here are great and genuinely nice people always willing to assist. The rooms were clean and well kept and nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms spacious and clean. It was also very convenient to have a Denny's restaurant within the hotel. The location of this hotel is also very good and on a main road with many shops and dining options. This place is good for an affordable family trip without sacrificing on quality.Jorge,Thank you for the great review. We are always looking at being very competitively price and to give our guest the best accommodations for the price in Napa. We will see you on your next trip to Napa."
"3407",3,"While traveling with 3 small kids, we booked this room for a quick stopover on a drive from Colorado to Iowa. It is right off Interstate 80 and could not be easier to find.

"3410",5,"Stayed only one night as a walk in. Beautiful clean room, delicious breakfast, super friendly staff. Walked across the street to a grocery store and other shops. This property is a credit to the Hampton brand. Highly recommended."
"3411",3,"Stayed for Baseball Spring Training @ 140 CAD., the free WIFI is a total Joke, no reception at all in the room and very limited in lobby and kept logging off, we have 4 devices so I know it was not the device. I asked if I can pay for wifi to get better reception, was told that's all they offer.The pool has problems as it's leaking all over the place outside, twice there and no towels, when asked for towel, they only brought 2 towels. If you don't get the room service by 10 am, they won't come back.Room was clean but little small for 4 people."

"3417",5,"The staff makes you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. They are all friendly, efficient and caring. Complimentary breakfast stays open until 10:30. I loved the variety of food and especially the fresh strawberries and raspberries. The 6:00 fresh baked cookies every day are yummy!"

"3424",3,"There were stink bugs on the curtains! The front desk was somewhat quick to come remove one or two. But by the end of the night, I had removed three myself. The complimentary breakfast was typical, although I would have enjoyed some toppings for the oatmeal. No one bothered to clear the entrance/exit driveway, which is a steep hill, after 6 inches of snow. There was no other hotel close enough to move to, as I was there for business."
"3425",4,"Hotel was pretty good. Really my only complaint would be that the bed wasn't comfortable, but I know it's hit or miss since everyone likes different kinds."
"3426",5,"When going places I like to see a landing point of a nice place of class. Clean rooms with a decent size to go along with it is a prayer."

"3428",5,"My lady and I occasionally enjoy overnight stays in hotels. We don't have a lot of money and hotels aren't cheap, so I'm very selective about where we stay. I selected Sonesta because it was close hey 97 and a short drive to Arumdal Mills Mall. I've been previously disappointed choosing familiar brand name hotels in Baltimore. I've learned that brands don't guarantee quality. I wasn't familiar with Sonesta but I figured the hotel had to be good because of the location. I didn't have a clue. Out of all the hotels I've visited within the past 2 years, this is the best. I could LIVE there. EVERYTHING was excellent."
"3429",5,"Best stay at a hotel."
"3430",4,"My wife booked this hotel for our conference. The room was nice and service was great if we requested anything they were quick to help. We didn't use the pool as it was usually raining when we would have used it. It would be nice to have a restaurant in the hotel although there are several places to eat nearby. The front lobby is kinda cool. Beds were comfortable and we had a good sleep. We wish not all lights were on one switch.Just another reason for you to return nothing better than a rooftop pool on a sunny day!Thanks for staying,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"

Booked two nights originally through Hotels.com and decided to stay one additional night and the staff honored the same price as the original price through Hotels.com. Absolutely the best continental breakfast bar none. Staff was very helpful with touring information and room was very neat and clean. Would definitely stay here again when back in DC area."

Outlets do not work, plugs fall out. Coffee pot never cleaned out. Towels received were stained. On first arrival, toilet had some poop floating in it. Phone did not work, no dial tone, no way to contact front desk. Went to continental breakfast, and muffins were covered with ants. She put them away, but next morning, the muffins served were stale. I believe she saved them and served them the next day."
"3451",5,"My friend and I selected this hotel for the extra room provided--a nice living room area that included a great flat-screen TV, small frig, microwave and sink. An ironing board and iron provided the ability to have our clothes look freshly pressed each day, the bathroom was beautiful and clean and the bed was very comfortable! (Great TV in the bedroom also). The made to order breakfast each day was of good quality and service was warm and friendly the evening drinks and snacks were great also. Maid service kept our room spotless! There isn't anything I could recommend that would have added to our hotel experience--I will definitely look for an Embassy Suites everywhere I go!"
"3452",5,"The hotel is well worth the extra money! Excellent staff, the facilities are very nice, and it's well located. 35 minutes from the beach in one direction 35 minutes from Williamsburg/Busch Gardens in the other direction.

"3455",3,"We appreciated our rest after a very busy day. The bed was very comfortable. The staff in the bar area was also congenial and helpful with a late meal. The room was smaller than I expected, but comfortable enough for one evening. The hotel looked older and could stand some freshening up. The wifi was limited and fairly weak. Lack of a free or reduced breakfast was disappointing."
"3456",5,"My experience in this hotel was perfect! Rooms are clean, well-appointed, not so big but privided of all comforts (Tv, coffee machine, bathroom, and free wifi). In each floor, near the lift, you can find a free water dispenser with new bottles and also some chocolates and candys. Every day at 5.00pm, in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts. The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city. It is located in the loop (the city center) on the river in front of the Trump tower. It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile (two of the most touristics place in the city). Moreover the hotel is close (5-7minutes by walk) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport. The staff of the hotel is extremly avaible and ready to meet all you needs. I was in chicago for a business travel so i can't give you informations about costs because i didn't manage the booking of the hotel. Anyway, after my experience, absolutly, I would suggest this hotel for a pleasant and comfortable stay in chicago.Dear Concetta D,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to provide a detailed review of your experience.

Which was wonderful so we didn't have to worry about the loud party crowds!!Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent mini vacation with us and we are delighted to know you had a great stay. We will commend all of our staff for exceeding your expectations with our service provided. Your business is very important to us and we look forward to always being your hotel of choice whenever you visit our city.Best regards,"

"3464",4,"Noise Excellent location"
"3465",3,"Uneventful and fine except I was told they could Not print invoice for charges,because it was booked through you. Call me and i will give u the name of the employee and you can be sure i have called my credit card company to check on what was posted."

"3468",3,"Booked this hotel due to proximity to Fedex Field only to realize it was 40 mins by metro. It would have been better to stay at a nicer hotel in a better area and take the metro from there. When i asked if i could walk back from the metro after the game, reception told me it might be better to run with the watch you're wearing."
"3469",5,"Good: Bed was awesome"

"3473",3,"Stay was ok, but a little expensive for what you can expect. Bad smell in the room, otherwise it was good."
"3474",4,"The best western plus is located 10 minutes away from downtown Napa. It is located on Soscal Avenue that connects you to many of the top Yelp eateries. The hotel itself is what we have come to expect from the Best Western Brand. Clean and comfortable rooms, but nothing extravagant. There is a short swimming pool (8 yards) and a hot tub with jets. The property was quiet and had ample parking. There is a Denny's around the corner and that didnt bother me like other reviewers. The only trace is that you can smell sausage and pancakes from the parking lot. They do offer a free full breakfast with coffee. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are afraid of the bed and breakfast scene like I am. Thank you for your review and recommendation. Our rewards members receive a free breakfast in the attached Denny's and most of our reviewers rate it above average as a Best Western Breakfast.. We are glad you enjoyed your free breakfast and stay with us and we hope to see you again in the near future."
"3475",5,"Booked a combo deal through Southwest, excellent value, very nice hotel. Clean rooms, quite, polite staff. Little smokey in the casino but you can get away from that. The gym was nice and they have a excellent restaurant Javier's a must go to place. Rooms are also fully automated, very cool."
"3476",5,"Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system. We almost missed our flight due to being unable to leave the lot.

"3481",4,"My daughter and I stayed here for a Mother's Day getaway. The hotel is in a great location, especially if you're here when they have the Napa Farmers Market located at the edge of the parking lot. There is also a nice movie theater in the same parking lot.

"3485",4,"Initially, I was a bit apprehensive because of the price of the parking and the lack of photos of the front and street view of the hotel. But I was very relieved by the parking garage around the corner of the hotel which costed 14.00 versus 42.00 for hotel valet parking. I was pleased with the location of the hotel as it was very conveniently located near a great restaurant (Nandos), a 24 hour CVS and a Whole Foods market. The staff at the hotel were very friendly from the moment we approached the outside of the hotel to the front desk, life guard at the pool and servers during the free breakfast. Great experience!"

The room was very nice, quiet and with a fantastic bed and everything. The service at the reception was very good and also during the rest of the stay.The butler service was also very good. We will definitely come back. The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York.

"3488",5,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Our hotel was steps away from many city attractions and restaurants. Hotel was clean, staff friendly, and room had a view. They served omelets at breakfast and the burgers in the bar/lounge were better than any on the street and available late at night!"
"3489",3,"The location is the best thing about this hotel. The walls are pretty thin so noise can be a problem. But what can you expect from a moderate/lower priced hotel"
"3490",3,"We stayed 2 nights at this motel. It was a pretty basic room without a refrigerator or microwave. It was clean and owners were friendly. It appeared that the bathroom had been recently updated. It has a pool and grill area which families used quite often. Rates were fairly reasonably for this time of year in the Old Forge area."

"3496",4,"I was highly satisfied with my accommodations. The room was most comfortable and spacious. Very easy to locate and access. Staff were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Everything I could have needed was available for meal preparation. The bed and pillows were of very high quality. I enjoyed my stay very much. I would recommend this facility without hesitation."

Their devotion to 100 satisfaction was evident everywhere we went from the bar, the pool, room service, check-in/check-out, and valet. I am proud that my city has such a hotel to represent!!! I most definitely will return!"
"3500",3,"The exterior and lobby were very unappealing. Very blah. The room was better--updated and clean. However at least 3 times water pipes clanged and thunked. One time was during the night and it woke of us. Not happy about that. The area around the hotel was only fair looking."
"3501",5,"We are considering Boise as a retirement place to live. We found the hotel to be very central to the areas we wanted to explore. It was clean, the staff was wonderful, we don't have anything negative to say about our visit."
"3502",3,"Bad: What I didnt like is the service of the staff. I reserved and paid last October a city view room, check in online on our way to the hotel and was assured key is waiting. But when we got there, no room available for city view. We were settled for a night in 3rd floor and we were assured the next 5nights we will be in the 6th floor. But the following day, they gave us a floor higher only, 4th floor. We cant see much of the city from 4th floor. All we can see is adjacent buildings. We were frustrated that there is no cafeteria for breakfast. Yeah, breakfast is included on the price but no chair to sit on, no table use. It is a grab and go breakfast. Very incovenient because breakfast is served in 5th and 6th floors's console table only. No microwave, no toaster. How can you eat the bagels they served in very cold temperature Secondly, we were not given instructions / info on our check in at the hotel what are the facilities they have for us. We only discovered while we were staying at the hotel. Like business center, fitness center,etc. The housekeeping, bad service! They forgot to replace the complimentary k-cup coffee. One day, they left a used pair of socks in our room. A pair of black socks rolled,dirty for a man whose size could be for a 6 footer and taller. My boys are only 5'3. Next day, they left again a wet soiled pink shirt on the table where the TV is. Why is that Everyday I always left as tip and a way of thank you for cleaning the room but all they leave is mess. Good: I like the location of this hotel. Very accessible to everything,from all kinds of food/resto to tourist attractions."
"3503",5,"This hotel was absolutely wonderful. I was a little leary at first but I was happily surprised when I walked into the lobby. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful....except for the concierge the evening we arrived. He was super annoying and kept bugging us to talk to him for ideas of things to do. Our room was spacious and clean. Our room was broken into two areas...a bedroom and a living room, both of which had tvs. We were extremely pleased with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel."
"3504",5,"Had a room on the harbor side and was treated to a manatee siting our first evening there. Comfortable, clean room with washer/dryer--great for tennis players. Excellent time at the tennis center--games set up for us by Zoe every day we were there. Rode bikes one afternoon, one afternoon at the spa--perfect!"
"3505",4,"Rooms spacious, including bathroom. Clean and functioning well. Attentive staff. Very dated decor throughout - distracting, but little impact on our experience there. Requested 2 queen as listed on Hotels.com, but hotel offers 2 DOUBLE beds, which is a significant drawback for our family. Free ear plugs because closing doors are LOUD. That might have been the only downside. Pool and hottub were great. Ample supply of towels with extended access hours as compared to some places we've stayed. Breakfast was good, but crowded. Layout is a challenge when busy as several key items are in corners or nooks. No place to line up but through the dining tables, pathway, etc. Would stay here again if the price were right. Otherwise, would be a more modern competitor with queen beds."
"3506",3,"Needing to watch our budget was what led us to 4 Flags Inn. We did not expect a 4 Star Hotel just wanted an average one for our 6 night stay. We have used 4 Flags twice and would again. Things were not perfect we didnt expect them to be at such a low price but our room was neat... More"

"3508",5,"The service was amazing! From the check-in to check-out, and everything in between, we were pampered and given the best service possible.

"3512",5,"If you're not a Seattle veteran, you need to know that there are 3 main downtown neighborhoods. The old city by Pioneer Square in the south, the heart of downtown near the Pike Place market, and the northern neighborhood near the Seattle Center (Space Needle). While the heart of downtown has traditionally been the best neighborhood for tourists to stay in, the ongoing revitalization of the Seattle Center area has somewhat shifted this equation. Personally, for tourist purposes, I like the Seattle Center neighborhood just as much -- primarily because it's a little less corporate, a little more casual, and has ready access to many of the best museums (like the EMP across the street from the Hyatt). It's also only a 20 minute walk to the Pike Place market from the Hyatt House, and they offer a complimentary shuttle service, too.In this context, the Hyatt House is a grear place to stay if you're OK with the Seattle Center location. The hotel is new, and has a nice modern vibe. Since it's an extended stay brand, rooms at the Hyatt House are large. For this particular location, they also made them stylish. As a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member, my family was upgraded to an extremely comfortable one-bedroom suite facing the Space Needle. Breakfast is well above average for a free hotel breakfast, My only complaint was that the omelette maker was completely overwhelmed, and it could take more than a half hour to get an omelette (the buffet food had no delays). It's a nice touch to offer omelettes, but it doesn't work unless they can be made efficiently.The shuttle bus can also be a bit of a mixed blessing. In rush hour traffic, the service can be quite slow. I'd recommend walking to downtown during peak periods.Dave'sreviews,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge"
"3513",1,"The carpet was so dirty that we had to where socks and still clean our feet. The Sheets for the bed felt like sandpaper and the shower never gave hot water. Cannot recommend staying here to anyone."
"3514",4,"We only had two days to spend in Baltimore so I chose this hotel based on it's location. It was even better than I anticipated. Walking distance to Fell's Point. The room was spacious and well appointed. It was loud in the morning with breakfast in the lobby and housekeeping starts knocking at 8am sharp. They'll keep knocking too which was irritating so if you want to sleep past 8 put the privacy card on your door handle. Breakfast ends at 10 which I wasn't told at check-in and didn't see in writing anywhere so we missed that the first day. We were there for crabby hour and it was delicious and a nice touch to the stay! I saw other reviews complaining about parking, we didn't have an issue. There's a lot and a ramp right next door."
"3515",4,"We stayed at the Best Western Courtesy Inn recently for four nights and were happy with our stay.

"3517",5,"Quality of this hotel is exceptional. Arguably the best service and quality of room, restaurants and bar that we have ever experienced. The restaurant for breakfast was great and the bar at cocktail time was typical of a New York happy hour, loud and happy.Dear Richard K, We appreciate your review on TripAdvisor of our hotel and we are delighted that you have made The St. Regis Hotel your new home away from home.

"3519",1,"Room was clean, breakfast was OK and the desk clerks were friendly. Now for the bad: My daughter tried putting brown sugar on her oatmeal and it was solid like a rock in the shaker.The juice machine was covered with fruit flies and the lady tending to the food was rude when we accidentally dropped some food on the floor stating she would be the one cleaning it up later. The 3rd floor hall was like an ice box due to remodeling. The heater in the room did not work properly. The pool was closed for renovations.The vending machine was almost completely out of food. Thanks for a horrible experience. It will be a cold day in Hades before Holiday Inn gets my hard earned money again."
"3520",5,"The room was nice although a little bit small. The employees were very nice. It was really nice to have snacks, sodas, coffee and water at all times. The price was really good realeated to the services. I definitely recommend it.Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your recommendation. I am happy to know you enjoyed the complimentary amenities as well as the staff services. Please come see us again!"
"3521",3,"Bad: The pool area was really disappointing. Very small and the service wasn't great. The bathroom in the room needed an upgrade. Needed a re-grouting in the shower, the sink had a huge crack in it and the sink made this weird gurgling noise when anyone above or below us turned on a tap. Good: The bed was comfortable."

"3529",5,"I stayed at The Maritime Hotel on May 21-22, 2016. It is a stylishly appointed space throughout, from the lobby to the restaurant to the rooms. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful both check in and check out were a breeze. They'll hold your bags for you if your room isn't ready at the time you check in and they'll hold them for you even after you check out if your check out time is earlier than when you're finally ready to leave Chelsea. Incredibly convenient location to lots of restaurants and activities, including the Highline. The hotel is also right across the street from The Chelsea Market, which is terrific shopping experience. I highly recommend booking The Maritime if you plan to stay in the Chelsea neighborhood. The only caveat I have is bring earplugs for sleeping, or some kind of white noise generator to drown out the sound of car horns honking all night. Other than that, it was a great stay."

"3534",5,"I had a fabulous stay. We stayed in the Tower Suite and it was fabulous. I would stay again. The only thing I didn't like is that they didn't have a microwave. I love the bathroom and the view was on the strip so it made it beautiful."
"3535",3,"The Suncoast Hotel itself was nice. The room we had was a standard king room and very spacious and clean. The bed and pillows were rather industrial (hard). The fitness room was well-maintained and the hotel overall pleasing. The casino was well-ventilated and equipped with all the standard gaming.The breakfast buffet was a bargain for we mature folks. The evening buffet was mediocre at best.The desk was verrrry slow in checking in.The biggest disadvantage of the Suncoast is its location out away from the Strip and downtown. It is isolated in a more residential part of northwest Las Vegas. They do try to compensate by making a free shuttle available which ran on time and took guests to the airport or to the Strip."

One light in the room worked, all others did not. I video taped it because I had never experienced anything like this. I immediately went back to the manager and expressed my concern. He would not give me a refund so I told him I would take it up with my office and their credit card company. There was no way I was going to stay there.

On the sunny days, outside pool was nice. The room had a desk, reclining chair and two dressers. Would have preferred a table with chairs over the 2nd dresser so we could play games in the room. Not a real problem....we just went to the lobby and used the tables there. Biggest complaint was with Travelocity. They were supposed to reserve a double bed room and booked us into a single king. My grandson was coming up for the weekend from his military base so it presented a little bit of a problem for one night. Their comment was they couldn't guarantee the room and we would just have to see if we could talk to the front desk. There were several soccer ball teams here when we checked in so there were no roll-away beds. We made do but it would have been better if they had made the reservation correctly to begin with. Will not book through them again.Overall...excellent experience. Even though there were several high school aged groups who were there during our stay...room was very quiet and no complaints with noise and everything was clean and well stocked."
"3595",5,"Overall very good stay..staff was very friendly. We at first were given a room without a fridge and microwave which we had booked. The front desk employee quickly changed our room and apologized immediately. Breakfast is from 630-10 and it's a great spread. The chef comes out to ask how everyone is doing and ensures the sterno and food supplies are fully stocked. Hot food, cereals, muffins,bagels,yogurt,fruit,pancake maker,burrito bar you name it they had it. Didn't feel rushed at all. We were 15 away from the city area and it's close to the highway which was convienient. Room was good but walls need to be insulated you can hear everything in the next room. Housekeeping was good. Pool wasn't open but that wasn't a major issue for us. Plenty of parking. Overall good stay we would come back."
"3596",5,"I have stayed at Indigo Inn several times and am always pleased with the room and especially the breakfast and afternoon food selections. Breakfast is GREAT .... in the afternoon they offer cheeses and crackers, etc. My only complaint is that the outdoor area has several fountains and I am not sure if these are the source of the smell...

"3597",5,"Very nice staff and shuttle bus for anything within 3 miles. Excellent breakfast. 2 blocks to get to any expressway, The Silver Diner was great. Great value for the bucks."
"3598",4,"Bad: The room is very small. The footstep sound from other room can be heard. The wifi is too weak. Good: What I really like is the location and decorations. It only takes 5 minutes to beach."
"3599",5,"We decided to go to Charleston for Thanksgiving weekend and had an enjoyable experience. Great location within an easy walk to all of the attractions.

"3602",2,"I was only there overnight, stayed on first floor. Room was small but adequate. Wallpaper falling off the wall in bathroom. When AC was turned on there was an awful musty, moldy odor. Had to turn it off due to my allergies. The next morning I found a HUGE spider in the bathtub. I don't do well with these things but managed to somehow drown it in the semi hot water the hotel offered. Have to say that that traumatized me a little. Hate spiders, especially big ones. I managed to take a shower after that, always looking around me for more. After I dressed I decided to make a cup of coffee in the room's keurig, poured the creamer that is supplied into the cup. It immediately curdled! When checking the expiration date on the creamer it read 8/11/15 and my stay was on 9/5/15. After that I just packed up and checked out. Receptionist at desk was nice but didn't offer discount for the problems I encountered. Only good thing I can say is the pillows were comfy. Checking this dump off my list."
"3603",2,"There was constant noise through out the night from noisey doors to guests talking loud. Sort of feels tile an apartment community. Certainly not my type of place for a good night rest."

The reason I dropped them a star is that they allowed 2 vehicles (cars with trailers) to remain in clearly marked fire lanes all night long. When I mentioned that to the front... More"
"3607",5,"Bad: One of the things we did not like was the fact that we couldn't wake up to a cup of coffee in the morning without paying an arm and a leg for one. The other was that they should at least offer free coffee and beverages to their customers. Washington State casino have a coffee and soda machines for their customers to enjoy as they play. I also do not like the idea of casinos shoving resorts fees down a person throat when they know that the percentage of customers do not use the resorts. Good: I enjoyed the friendly staff."

"3615",5,"I was with four other people on a birding trip to watch the hawk migration. We spotted over 50 species of birds as we traveled across the keys. The hotel is new. The room was spacious and I loved the shower, microwave, and mini frig. The breakfast was wonderful and allowed us to make an early start for our birding. I commend Rosemary Johnson, an employee, that assisted me in finding ice, entering the pool area, and making me feel welcome even though it was late at night. Thank you for a lovely experience.Thank you for your comments. So glad you had a great stay. Rosemary is one of many of our amazing team members here to assist our guests. Thank you for staying with us. Hope you come back again to explore more of this wonderful bird sanctuary habitat."

"3627",4,"This is a very clean hotel with spacious rooms in a beautiful scenic locale. They offer a full hot breakfast and have coffee available 24/7 and the rates are very reasonable. My only gripe would be that they should have more than one elevator for as large as this hotel is. A lot of people opted to take the stairs."
"3628",2,"Terrible. Weak wifi. Room wasn't ready until 7pm. Short staffed I guess. TV had a big scratch in it. Iron was broken."

"3631",3,"Great location with easy on and off of the freeway in any direction. Hot breakfast was very good. Rooms a little run down but satisfactory. Price was very reasonable for the location and the pool was well maintained. Staff polite and helpful. I travel to this area a couple of times a year and this was my first time staying in this hotel, I will utilize this hotel next time."
"3632",3,"Bad: Non smoking rooms smelt like smoke and just all the cigerate smoke throughout hotel. And room drains slow draining. Good: I liked the lanai restaurant and valet parking"
"3633",2,"Bad: Old outdated rooms, even though its a classic hotel does not mean they dont have to put forth effort to modernize rooms. Good: Was right in Fremont street"
"3634",5,"I was hesitant staying here but I am extremely happy I did, our room was a very spacey corner double and it had a wonderful view. Customer service was incredible, Kathy was able to check us in a little earlier and I forgot his name but made a mean bacon and egg croissant sandwich. Hotel is in a great location 2 blocks away from Bourbon and one from Canal. Close to everything but far enough to hear all the noise. I would definitely stay there again especially for the great rate we got.Thanks so much for your review! I always enjoy sharing comments like these with our staff and giving Kathy and our cook, Mike the kudos they deserve. We are delighted you had a great time here with us and we look forward to having you back with us again soon.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager"
"3635",5,"I have to recommend your housekeeping staff. The roof was fit for a king. I am employed in the housekeeping field so my standards in cleanliness and neatness go way beyond and my room was neat clean and very nice. I enjoyed the breakfast the hotel offered in the morning. The staff coming in the front door was very welcoming and pleasant. If I could I would stay at this hotel 3-4 days a month. I really didnt want to leave. Thank you for a great stay."
"3636",5,"Great location - very close to the freeway and conveniently located to the restaurants. we had a big family room on the first floor-- 2 queen beds, very nice bathroom and big closet!

"3637",3,"My Wife I and a friend stopped here on our way back from Myrtle Beach. Make no mistake this is not a resort property. It is a simple but comfortable road stop hotel. Check in was efficient.

"3638",5,"Check in was speedy. Everything was clean. Room was comfy. The breakfast was a little average but overall everything was fine."
"3639",1,"NOT shabby chic, just shabby. We had stayed at the Chelsea in the past and expected the Annex to be at least similar. But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all."

I called the morning after we checked in to explain situation. We wanted to see if we could get smaller room since it was just the two of us instead of four.

"3655",5,"I have stayed a number of Best Westerns over the last 30 years in Canada the USA and this one at Wapakoneta, OHIO rates right up there with the best of them. Was easily accessible off the interstate. Very clean room and kitchen area. Staff were very friendly professional."

"3666",4,"Bad: I didn't like that check-in 'begins' at 4pm. You check in and wait for them to call you when your room is ready. Ours was ready at 6p. This was more of a plain hotel, not like a 'Vegas' hotel. Food, entertainment, and 'gambling' were limited. This is the best spot to be AWAY from Vegas while IN Vegas...if that's what you're looking for. Good: All amenities were top of the line."
"3667",2,"Room was dark, and smelled musty. Everything was well worn and in dire need up updating. Very mundane bathroom. Front desk staff was indifferent at best. I was so bad, we changed our stay from two nights to one and moved to a Hilton Garden Inn that was far better."
"3668",3,"Hotel is dated room was fine. Convenient for a race in downtown st. Louis for an out of tower. Was called several times prior to stay, and called after stay which got annoying. The after stay phone call was trying to sell me on additional stays at other hotels. I found this incredibly frustrating. I have never had this happen with any other hotel I have booked through here."

"3674",3,"My second cousin was getting married on the beach a short walk from this hotel, so I was very happy to find this place at a discounted price on the week of the trip. The hotel was fine overall but there were some small things that bugged me: * The beds were squeaky * The towels were scratchy * Some machinery within a locked area in the bathroom was running and making a lot of noise RIGHT next to the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom, next to the bed where my wife and I slept. It didn't keep me up at night, but it was noticeable. Some good things to make sure you don't think it was all bad: *The hotel's restaurant, Tradewinds, had great food, and it provided good room service AND it was the first time I'd seen room service at a reasonable price. *The hotel is right on the beach, and since it's not in the crowded part of VA beach shore, there's not so many other people to deal with. Also, the hotel is on the shore of VB that is in the Chesapeake Bay, so the water is much calmer than the beach along Atlantic Avenue something to consider if you have young children."
"3675",5,"We had a wonderful time on our 25th anniversary. We highly recommend this hotel and their staff including the Front desk, Consear, bellhops, valet and all the people working the restaurants(5) etc. We especially enjoyed the saltwater pools.. this is definitely a five star atmosphere - very Ohana!

Hotel doors are not lock and in fact some could not be locked because the operating bar was missing. When I told them about the unsecured doors, the reply was that they had cameras. Breakfast was a joke - kids cerials, mini bagels and cupcakes with terrible coffee. Our flight was delayed a day and we checked out and used another hotel. Best description is it is run on the cheap. Shame on Ramada."
"3679",2,"Picked this hotel because it was advertised as the host hotel for a dog show/obedience trial.

The room to the front was noisy and not clean. Bath room was part of room which made the room damp! Wifi and access to highway easy. Parking ok."
"3682",3,"The hotel was nice. New renovations, the breakfast was very very good, and the rooms were clean. The shuttle to the Metro was great. The front desk workers were not nice and unprofessional. Seemed like they hated their job. They also take 100 out for a security deposit. They said I'll get it back within 17 business days. The location is sketchy. Do not walk at night. Really nothing to do around that area unless you have a car or hoping onto the Metro."

"3696",3,"The hotel definitely shows age and tons of wear. We had two rooms both in somewhat poor condition that both smelled strongly of smoke (non smoking rooms). Stains, tears, and burn marks pretty much sums it up. Staff was very friendly!"

"3703",4,"Great central location for exploring downtown Napa and the Napa Valley. Good access from HWY 29, HWY 12, and HWY 128. There are plenty of much more expensive choices in the Napa area, but saving a few on lodging allows for stretching for great local food and wine.Thank you for your review and I am glad we were a great place to stop on your visit to the Napa Valley. We aim to be the best value for your in Napa. Hope to see you again in the near future."
"3704",3,"Room was clean and efficient. The efficiency apartment layout was nice. Only critique was the faucet on the bathtub dripped, but i just closed the door and it did not bother me. I was too tired at the end of the workday to bother calling in maintenance. Breakfast is sparse, coffee, instant oatmeal, packaged muffins and some fruit."

"3738",2,"Bad: The property tries so hard to be trendy that it actually made it very difficult to stay as a family. There was only one pillow each, three towels for four people and a tightly restricted supply of coffee- only two, environmentally unfriendly, pods. The oddest part was there were no teaspoons, only stirrers and amazingly no kettle- and only two mugs for four people. We had to bother house keeping just to bring a kettle up to make tea (also not supplied). This hotel sells trendy box water for 8 which pretty much sums up how far off the mark this place is with practicalities. Trendy sure, but practical and sensible...no. Reminded me of of a start up thats well funded but just silly. Also the rooms air conditioning setting included jet engine or off so that was extremely uncomfortable. I wouldnt stay here again given they also have an odd naughty drawer and I needed to explain to my 7 year old what sex dust was. Extremely odd place to stay as a family. Good: I liked that the lobby was filled with fun games and a great bar which was very relaxed and welcoming."

"3750",5,"The staff is friendly and accommodating without being ingratiating. The facility is clean and well maintained. The hotel is close to the highway and easy enough to find, though just a bit tucked away. This makes it a little unsettling to find the first time, but it makes it a quiet corner to get away."

"3768",5,"I was a little worried by some of the reviews I read that stated the staff was rude and the hotel was in disrepair but the price was amazing so we went ahead and booked....and I'm SO GLAD WE DID!! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (and I'm from the South, so I know friendly.) The hotel has normal wear and tear, but was very clean and nicely furnished. Some people may not like that the microwave and fridge are extra (would have been nice to have but we wouldn't have used either so it didn't bother us). Beds are very comfortable and rooms are large enough to lounge in the evenings after a long day. The free shuttle service was great. The Metro (subway) is farther away than listed. The site stated 1/4 mi, but it's closer to 3/4 or 1mi. We had no problem walking it during the day. If this is your first visit, be sure to ask specifically where the shuttle will pick up. We were on the wrong side and missed it the first time. If you exit the Metro up the escalators, go out and to the left up the steps to where there are several bus stops. If you exit to the right near the greyhound stop (and a several story parking garage), you're on the wrong side. The shuttle drivers were very nice and happy to give directions and tips. Once you're on the Metro, a 20min ride gets you into the city. Definitely worth it to save hundreds on a hotel room. There are several restaurants right outside the hotel and several more within 1/4-1/2mi walk. There are also some smaller shopping places if you forget any necessities. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return if we're ever back in the DC area."

The decor is beautiful (Erykah Badu-like art on the wall and retro galore with a bit of artisan flare). My room was at the end of the corner and I didn't hear a thing, a privilege when traveling in a major city. The front desk manager called later to see if I had a good stay. Shout-out to Kavana at the front desk who was kind up my check out and departure as well as the people working in the first floor restaurant. The endive salad and fish was a perfect meal. The roof top bar looked like a lot of fun, but aside from a quick snap shot, I didn't stay as I needed to decompress from my travels. But I shall return. 12-15 minute safe walk to the Quarter. Take Rampart or any parallel street to Canal and head toward river.Thank you for taking the time to review our property and we are delighted to know you had a great stay with us. It sounds like every part of your experience at our hotel was perfect which is music to our ears. We certainly appreciate you staying with us and look forward to having you back as our guest whenever your travels bring you back to Nola.Best regards,"
"3803",5,"Bad: Overbooked, could not get additional night. Good: Nice accomodations."
"3804",1,"Went for dinner and food was amazing. Only problem was the owner ray was wasted, knocking drinks over and we stayed all weekend and every night he was drunk. My gf said he wouldn't stop gropping her. Nice place but needs new ownership."
"3805",4,"We had a great stay in Lake Placid, despite the incredible chill (low in town was -30). The Best Western served as a wonderful launch point. Conveniently located to downtown, the Olympic Skating Rinks and many restaurants. Rooms were warm and comfortable. Service is friendly and caring. Central facilities include a working fire place, large breakfast area, cafeteria, pool, sauna... More"
"3806",3,"I've stayed here several times. Spacious rooms, clean, efficient staff. Nice workout room. Always surprises me that they don't offer a free basic breakfast. I'd stay here again but do wonder if there's something better available."
"3807",5,"Great hotel, restaurant and bar. Close to my work destination."
"3808",5,"Fabulous place to stay right on 11st (Route 66) 2 blocks from the famous Tallys Cafe. Easy to get to all of Tulsa 66's sites from motel. Very well kept property. This is a ma pa type mote. Able to park adjacent to room."
"3809",3,"Staff very friendly and rooms very nice. One problem with room above us having a party and very loud, had to call front desk at 2:45 a.m. and again at 3:15 a.m. before they were able to get them to quiet down. Otherwise, good experience and again a wonderful staff."
"3810",5,"My hubby and I first stopped here on July 28 and this is our 3rd time back since. We love the bloody Mary's and the food has been great every time. They have just recently started to serve breakfast and it was very good. We will be back... Obviously."
"3811",5,"This was one of the cheaper rates in the area. (This of course is a relative term in the DC area) I was surprised to find a great, spacious suite with great service. The price included a hot breakfast buffet. I'm looking forward to going back. Chuck"

"3818",5,"Great hotel, great staff"
"3819",4,"We stayed here one night, because it was the end of our family vacation, and we ended up staying too late to leave/drive home. So we got this place cause it was cheapest in the area, and ended up being almost better than the room we had just stayed in for a week. The beds and pillows were so nice and fluffy, the floors were new and nice not dirty. There was a micro, fridge, and coffemaker. The tv was a flat screen. The bathroom was newly redone and very nice. Was happy i didn't have to be scared."

"3822",5,"I was skeptical about this hotel after experiencing Area coffee on the lobby level of this hotel, but have to say I am positively surprised.

"3828",3,"I did not stay in the room a whole lot as I was in town for a conference. My husband, however, came with me and spent most of the day in the room while I was at my conference. He was not impressed with the wifi strength, intermittent moments of loud guests and lack of a microwave in the room. Other than that we were pleased with the comfort of the room in general."
"3829",5,"Got off to a rocky start, but after I was able to make the staff aware of my concerns my stay was FANTASTIC. I will Definitely make this my location of choice when I am in the DC area. I would also like to state there is no one staff member that I can commend over anther. I have been in the service industry for 25 years and it takes a lot to impress me I am impressed!"

"3832",4,"I stayed here on a business trip the hotel was clean and my room even had a recliner in it. The staff were helpful and pleasant and the wifi was nice because no password was required. I really enjoyed the afternoon buffet plenty to choose from along with two free drinks."
"3833",3,"This hotel is conveniently located off 1-10 but for the price we were a bit disappointed. The carpet in the hallway on our floor was very wrinkled, needs to be restretched or replaced and we had a lot of trouble getting our door open as the keylock was rickety and had a sort of personality of its own you had to lean on the door at the same time as putting the keycard in the slot. There was a lot of noise from someone in the room above us, walking or jumping on the floor which of course was our ceiling. It went on for a long time and made it so my mom couldn't sleep so I called the front desk to complain. The front desk clerk must have called them so it stopped for a good while, happened again briefly and then stopped for the night. The breakfast was good, pretty standard for La Quinta and I liked that they had Mexican salsa, fried potatoes and good sized disposable paper coffee cups. I don't like the weird industrial type scrambled eggs at this and other La Quintas because they don't even seem like real eggs at all, more like some liquid egg heated in a microwave. They have little flavor and the texture leaves a lot to be desired. Wish they were real, freshly cooked eggs and that someone in top management at La Quinta headquarters would pay attention and improve that. That would definitely improve my opinion of their breakfasts!Dear Traveler,Thank you for choosing our property for your traveling needs. We are working on plans to renovate the hotel this year. It is our hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W."

There was a long table that divided the room from sitting to bed. The pool was small and very cold. Definitely not heated!"

"3844",5,"We stayed for three nights at the West Street hotel after experiencing two disappointing nights at another hotel. The staff here was wonderful and helpful. The amenities were amazing. We loved the rooftop pool and the views! amenities included the Bar Harbor Club which housed a workout room, and sauna. It was wonderful."
"3845",5,"This resort is worth every one of its five diamonds! Stunning service with kindness, support and upgrades when any question came up. Ex. When I called the operator to find out the opening time of Jean Phillipe, she said, they opened 30 minutes ago, Mr. G---, they are waiting for you...--absolute magic."
"3846",5,"Spent 3 nights. Very large rooms and full kitchen that is separate from the bedroom which is important, since you do not hear the refrigerator. On Wednesday, Oct. 21 they had all you can eat complimentary pizza."
"3847",4,"It was okay for the price. I was not there during the daylight hours. It was very quiet Needs a little up grade. Afraid of elevator. I was a female,alone,in an unfamiliar town, but i felt safe there. Other than upgrade, it was a pleasant stay."

"3851",4,"Stopped in at this casino on the way back from Birchrun MI shopping. Not to fond of trying to find our way in and the area. But all went well. Found the money wen quick so the visit was not long. Did not hear a lot of winners going off. Could of been just the Sunday we were there."
"3852",3,"My experience checking in and out was terrible. Service appeared Lethargic, uninterested and uninvested. I would have gone elsewhere had it not been pouring down rain. The sheets were too thin, seemed cheap and didn't make for very good sleep. I have stayed here before and was very happy. That's why I had come back. Things were off this trip."
"3853",4,"Interesting staying here for the first time. The reception desk is tucked in a small alcove inside the new main door. The room then opens up into a very nice lobby. You need your room key to activate the elevator. The layout of rooms is quite varied. Not just a straight hall with rooms on each side. I was on... More"
"3854",5,"My only one complaint is that you have not mentioned your phone number in the web site( when I took the print out after booking, there is no phone number on the sheet). I was not aware that your shuttle service will not pick from Crystal city metro station, so I waited for your vehicle for about 20mins, and then I got help from Rennainace hotel's shuttle.Thank you"
"3855",5,"Had a blast next time will bring wife and kids lots to do here and really felt welcomed also enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff are very helpful and friendly. Sure to recommend Aria to all my friends and family."
"3856",4,"Bad: Initially had a two double bedded room (later switched) and the beds in this room were too small and woefully uncomfortable. Mattresses were sub standard. However, were swiftly moved to much more comfortable king bedded room. Good: ber cool. Tech savvy property with atmospheric bar area and games room. Very accommodating, knowledgeable and friendly front front desk staff. King rooms are spacious and comfortable Location could not be better."
"3857",4,"Most probably I would give it a excellent review if it was not for the service obtained on Saturday. Sam (shuttle driver), Ester, Ana (Bar attendants) and front desk personnel for Thursday and Friday gave us a 5 star service. Everything went down to the drain Saturday afternoon had to wait for over an hour at the train station driver and front desk attendant blamed each other. I put it behind and most definitely I would stay again good breakfast, good service overall, location, rooms are kept clean."
"3858",5,"Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!"
"3859",5,"When we booked the hotel we knew that they were undergoing renovations so we expected some inconvenience. The checkin area was in a different location, all you needed to do was follow the signs. Checkin was fast. Our room was a 2 bedroom suite with a king in each room. The room was recently renovated and was absolutley beautiful. Plenty of room for 4 adults. We will be reserving a room again next September. There is shopping, food an liquor store right around the corner. The only downside was that our room was directly under the temporay breakfast cafe. If possible, that should be the last room to be checked into."
"3860",5,"It had been a number of years since my husband and I visited Bar Harbor when we decided to return. Acadia Suites had been our wonderful home away from home several times in the past, and it didn't disappoint this time.

"3864",5,"A few miles west of I-75. Near restaurants and mall. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean. Hotel appeared to be fairly new. We had a king bedded room with sofa bed. For this area a car is needed."
"3865",5,"Bad: Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal. Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!"
"3866",5,"I headed to Chicago to celebrate with friends all of our September birthdays and the Central Loop Hotel was amazing. Great location, great service and so comfortable and clean. I would describe it as a New York style room - small but certainly roomy. The beds were amazing, the pillows so soft and fluffy and my entire experience (3 days) was great. The staff was incredibly helpful and found me a room that was ready for an early check-in. I really liked that on each floor at the elevators they had a purified water station and empty, sealed water bottles for the guests use. What a great idea. The attached Elephant Castle was a great spot for a cocktail or breakfast."
"3867",3,"Easy to park our car outside the hotel. The receptionist very warm and friendly. The foyer very clean and welcoming. The corridor to our room also clean and well decorated. Our room was a good size for a family of three. Sadly not as clean as the sign in the bathroom suggested The room is quite dark and as the... More"

"3872",3,"This was the only place we could find that was under 200/night, available last minute, and received decent recent reviews. The staff is nice, room is clean and beds were comfortable. I had a hard time sleeping because it was a bit stuffy as there is no AC. It's definitely not worth the rate, but considering what other hotels were... More"
"3873",4,"The room was great!! We stayed in an Executive level room. The front desk staff wasn't very friendly. They had a lifeguard on duty at the pool all the time which was nice. The breakfast was very good with a nice variety of foods. It's very convenient to the metro. Free parking at the hotel was a plus. It is the last stop on the metro which at first we thought was a bad thing but ended up being good since we always had a seat in the morning on the way to D.C. Overall, I would recommend this hotel especially for the price. It's also very convenient to the Springfield Mall which is currently closed due to renovation but should open next year."
"3874",5,"We have driven through Grants Pass, OR several times.

"3876",5,"Staff at Front Desk VERY helpful and friendly and helpful with the area information,"
"3877",5,"Good: When we booked the room the website said breakfast was not included. Upon checking in we were given breakfast vouchers for the next morning.The staff is excellent! Loved our stay here!"
"3878",3,"With all the other choices in the area, I'll stay somewhere else next time. This is the 1st Embasy Suites I won't stay at again. It doesn't appear that they care about the upkeep of the hotel and as a non-smoker, I wasn't impressed with the smoke everywhere! I DID receive the non-smoking room I reserved...Too bad it wasn't smoke-free...because the room REEKED!!"
"3879",4,"Bad: Bathroom a bit small. Good: Good hotel. Close to beach and bars and restaurants. Good staff"
"3880",4,"The rooms are actually really nice and updated. The common areas are older and outdated, but rooms are surprisingly nice. Motel 6 immediately next door to Hilton and Marriott Marquis, but a third the price.Nice new fridge and microwave in room. My dog was allowed at no extra cost. Room was quiet. Couldn't hear hallway noise. If you don't mind missing the extra common area atmosphere, swimming pool, pricey restaurants, etc and just want a clean safe modern room with all the necessary amenities and free parking, come here. Free parking in downtown Atlanta is unheard of. Gave cleanliness a 4 cuz comforter smelled musty, but everything else was perfect. Overall a 4 cuz of no extras besides the nice room and free parking."
"3881",4,"Well, I had to stay for two months and was a great experience. The room was well cleaned and you feel it's home coz' the design of the condo makes you feel so. The front desk staff was awesome and trust me you will have a wonderful experience with all of them. This hotel is definitely worth the price."
"3882",5,"When I checked in the front desk staff was really helpful and nice they upgraded me rooms because they were out of 2 queen size beds and they let me know at check in so when I went into the room the beds were so big my kids loved it because they had a big bed and the room was... More"

Staff were very friendly and helpful throughout the stay. They provided breakfast and drink tickets, which I didn't use as I am picky about my food. Free... More"
"3894",5,"This was really a nice hotel property and would stay there again. Rooms were very clean and the property was well kept. The breakfast was good. It was quiet. The hotel staff was very helpful and the Internet was free. We stayed using a senior citizen rate and thought the rate was very reasonable compared to other motels in town."
"3895",4,"This was a convenient stop on our way from Indiana to Florida. It is a handy Off and On to I-77. The hotel is in top shape and our room was large and comfortable. The bed was one of the best we have had in a hotel. We would be happy to stay again."
"3896",5,"In town for family hospital emergency. Staff was so helpful, extended my stay. There were no rooms in this small town due to graduations, weddings etc. General Manager made sure I had a room. Excellent customer service."
"3897",2,"I booked a Superior room. Upon check in I requested a room down stairs due to my inability to climb stairs. Was informed there were none. Then she said wait a minute I have the handy cap room, I asked if was a superior room and was told it was. The room was not a SUPIOR room. I paid for supior."

"3900",5,"The Troubadour is excellent. Clean, secure and accommodating. All are super friendly and helpful. Quiet, felt safe and the extra was coffee, hot and ready, in the lobby each morning. Centrally located.Thank you for the great review, we look forward to your next visit. Wayne General Manager"
"3901",5,"Stayed for 4 days here. The Amenities are awesome. The staff were friendly. The only thing negative during my stay was that I lost money from gambling. The beer was expensive here. Otherwise the whole experience was exceptional."
"3902",3,"The bed was comfy staff were very friendly. The Hotel appears to be fairly new, so it's very clean well kept. It's right off a pretty busy street, so there was quite a bit of road noise at night. Ask for a room away from the road if you can."
"3903",4,"Good: Great location on Ocean Drive. Room and amenities were nice and comfortable. Nice lounge, bar area. Very nice and helpful staff. Bathroom a bit tight but fine."
"3904",5,"We stayed here for three nights whilst visiting Busch gardens. Upgraded to a room on the 11th floor for only 30/night. The views were amazing. Hotel was immaculately clean,staff friendly and courteous-Suzy on concierge was amazingly helpful. What would you expect from a lady from Derby,England Would definitely return."

"3909",4,"Hotel and room were very clean. I didn't need any extraordinary service but the staff was friendly and helpful during check-in and check out although they were a little slow and there was a ~5 min line for both. Free breakfast was the usual for a holiday inn express, which is pretty good as far as free breakfasts go. I walked from the hotel to Hominy Grill for dinner (.6 miles) and to MUSC for an interview. You are pretty close by but you have to cross multiple busy streets without a crosswalk or traffic light so it would not be walkable for everyone. Parking is free and the lot seems adequately big."

"3914",4,"We stayed 3 nights. Our first night was awful, the bed was very uncomfortable.

"3918",5,"My stay at the hotel was only one night but it was great. I so enjoyed watching the planes take off."
"3919",4,"Nice and clean. Decent sized TV that you can rent movies, N64 games, go online, or listen to music. Not much closet space, only get one dresser, but plenty of hanging room. Nice bathroom. Bed was comfortable, but pillows were a little stiff. Kitchen was large enough. Full sized refrigerator with freezer. They have some pots and a pan, and a broiler pan, but no cookie sheets. Plenty of utensils and glasses, and a few things like serving spoons. There's a dish washer, and they give you the detergent. Good microwave, and cabinet space. The oven wasn't the best, but good enough. Take advantage of kitchen, stuff down here is expensive. Friendly staff that was multi-lingual, but spoke English very well. I think their website said olympic sized swimming pool, but the pool was not Olympic sized. There was a lifeguard on duty, but he did not double as a pool boy so there was a good bit of leaves and stuff floating around. Overall I was very happy with the hotel and would definitely stay here again."
"3920",2,"I stayed at this hotel about a month before this stay and was not impressed. They were under construction so I decided to try it again.

"3922",3,"Location, Location, Location.... yes. But facility definately showing aging. Parking should be included in the cost of stay. It is kind of like saying rooms are $/ night, but you have to pay to use the toilet. But with that said location could not be better."

However a couple that were friends of mine later called and made a reserv and recvd a king suite! Additionally our heat was broken all week end and it was quite chilly. They attempted to repair twice w/no luck."
"3925",5,"We stayed in Room 426. The check-in was easy and fast. The entire staff was most friendly and helpful. The housekeeping was outstanding...our room was beautifully maintained and quickly prepared. The staff in the breakfast room was really great...felt like we were at home, but better. The entire weekend of our stay was excellent...could not have asked for better."

The only thing missing at this hotel is a restaurant. We did not find the breakfast area very appealing, so we went elsewhere. Would definitely stay here again... More"

Emily and maintenance man are the best as is the rest of the staff who are for the most part. Convenient location-close to everything and get what you pay for. We'll be back next year."
"3932",2,"Check in was quick. Room was clean. About 11pm we called to the front desk for a blanket. 15 minutes later, still not there. We called back to the front desk, to inquire as to the blankets location. We were then told they did not have available staff to bring it up. I went to the front desk to retrieve it. Surprise, 2 people at the desk. The next morning I called for some towels. 20 minutes later, called again. Another 20 minutes, we were sharing towels. They never showed. One of the adults in our party found bed bugs! I went down to the front desk and asked for a manager. He did not want to come out of his room, stating he didn't get back to his room until very late. After some insistance, he showed up. His answer was to give me a 10 gift card to Target. I like most of the Garden Inns we have stayed at. This one will never see me again."
"3933",5,"The hotel room had the latest in modern technology all easily controlled by a tablet. The range and quality of the many restaurants was astounding. We loved the high end Mexican restaurant and the breakfast buffet...which offered a vast choice! I'm sure this is modern high end Vegas at its very best."

"3940",5,"Came to town to bury my father in law in family plot. We had a total of seven people in three double rooms-we were all very comfortable. Breakfast was very good, hotel employees courteous and helpful. Only negative was the bathrooms were small. But, they were clean. Overall, value was great, room was clean, and we were in a safe part of town. We were on the highway side, which was a little noisy, but I had my earplugs. No one else was bothered by the noise. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a room not backed up to the highway. Hotel was great with accommodating all of our requests."

While parking is available next to the hotel, the cost is 22.00 per pay and if you use valet parking, it 29.00 per day. You would think for the price they charge per night for a room, parking would be included."
"3944",4,"Perfect location. Best option for sixflags great adventures"
"3945",2,"We we checked into the hotel, the lady was not very friendly and seemed to be lacking some customer service training. We had to let the water run for, at leas,t 5 minutes before taking a warm (not hot) shower. Also,the t.v. reception kept going in and out. The hotel was not kid/family friendly at all. The only restaurant available for breakfast was a ""sports bar"" that either sat 2 or 6 people and all the tables were the pub style which does not work very well for a 1 and 3 year old. The only option the staff gave us was to eat at another hotel restaurant."

"3953",5,"From the moment I arrived I had the best experience. The hotel was located near several restarants that were within walking distance and the hotel even had room servicee. The room was clean and very spacious. Another bonus was that there was free parking for rental cars or if you drove your own car. Overall great service and if I go back to the area I will definitely look into staying there again!"
"3954",4,"Very comfortable and plush accommodations at a reasonable price right off Foothills Blvd. Beds were especially comfortable. Breakfast was a little disappointing but varied enough that there was something for everyone"
"3955",5,"Bad: The fan in our room made a ticking sound throughout the night which was annoying. Also, there are not many choices for food. A couple of flat breads are offered for dinner. Breakfast is more reasonable with pastries, bagels, and fruit. Good: The bed was very comfortable. The space in the room was well used. Very clean. I loved the exposed brick throughout the halls, and that actual keys are given out, not key cards. Great location and staff."
"3956",5,"The front desk man was very rude. If I didn't like the indoor pool I would never go back again. He was very arrogant and acted as if he didn't care if our stay was enjoyable. Told me false information and made it difficult for me to check in.They need to rehire a new front desk person if I ever see him again I'm turning the other way."
"3957",5,"Bad: The shower sometimes turned cold and the ironing board was a little too small. Good: The room was very clean and tidy. The location is minutes from south beach and the staff was very friendly even though I only talked to two of them."
"3958",5,"The hotel offers nice spacious rooms. If you have a room on a higher floor you will have great views around the city. The staff is very friendly and efficient.

"3964",5,"We were in town for a wedding and this location was chosen by the bride and groom for the people coming in for the wedding. We have never been disappointed at Hampton in the past and we were not disappointed this time. The only thing difficult with this hotel was getting to it."
"3965",4,"This Hotel was much better than expected after reading some of the negative reviews here. I was incredibly pleased with the room, the staff, and the location. The room was fairly modern with 2 perfect double beds. The bathroom and shower were perfect. The Hotel is a 5 minute drive to downtown Napa and about 10-15 minutes to the Silverado Trail. The hotel provided breakfast coupons to Denny's which is directly next door and was perfect for us - I had a healthy egg-white and fruit breakfast while my travel companions gorged themselves on Denny's Grand Slam. I would definitely return here for its cleanliness, staff, and proximity to everywhere I wanted to be.I am glad we surpassed your expectations. We pride ourselves on our clean well appointed rooms and our customer service. Thanks for the review and we will see you on your next visit."
"3966",2,"BW has an annex! It's on the far side of the street. We had a roach and a broken air conditioner the first day. Had to repack and move to another room! On the third day in 103 degrees the elevator broke. We're 75 and our new room was on the third floor! All outside surfaces are covered w tar rather than repaving. It's pealing and looks very shabby. Only four umbrellas at the outdoor pool for over 100 guests! We had stayed in the main bldg. before, and were very disappointed to be across the street."
"3967",3,"The good First let's talk about the great things at this flagship hotel and there are so many! The location is in my opinion is as good as it gets in NYC! Two blocks from Saks, Museum of Modern Art and St Patrick's Cathedral, one block from Madison Ave, three blocks from Central Park and the city's best restaurants within easy walking distance. Everything is at your fingertips! The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring, 24 carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers, all as you would expect and more. The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning! Hats off to the extraordinary designer!The rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers, crystal chandeliers, deep crown moldings, luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks, TV in the mirror, deep soaker tub, separate shower and European-style private flush. The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world. The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well. They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly. Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished. Wi-Fi is included, as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service. The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers. The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean! All the staff are friendly from the doormen, waiters, maids, valets, etc. We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection, well prepared and quickly served.The Bad Being an SPG member for 16 years with over 900 nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy. It is something we have always received at all SPG properties, 100 of the time since gaining Platinum status many, many years ago. We booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn't like they didn't know we were coming. We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade. We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec 31/15 they are useless to us now. Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded. It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade. She didn't seem to understand the Platinum perks. Talking with her was like talking to a wall, so unlike other 5-star hotels we've stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed. We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go. I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets. Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve. Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as 154 nights in one year alone with SPG. He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since 1985 when we met and had our very first trip together! Of course when you don't get a suite you don't get the toiletries that go with it which I've always loved at the St Regis. I suppose I could have requested it but I didn't. We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday.The Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week, one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court. We thought we'd stay in-house after long hours watching the Macy's Parade. Huge mistake! Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with 2 tiny bar chairs! We couldn't believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey! Not even real turkey. I couldn't understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner. Now I know! No one in their right mind would pay 400 USD for that miserable meal for two people. I can't adequately describe our disappointment. We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Year's Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid. We couldn't even eat the salads. What kind of chef can't make a salad. Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking. Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a 200 credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner! That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her. I don't think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can't blame him. It's a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a 5-star dining room! After visiting 6 other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just doesn't even make sense!Dear Katherine B,Thank you for taking the time to submit your recent review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our leadership team has been in touch with you while you were on property and again after your stay. We truly hope to regain your trust and wish you all the best for the holiday season. Kindly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"

"3985",5,"We basically picked this hotel off the internet by the nice picture. What a pleasant treat it was right from beginning to end! I cannot say enough about every aspect of this property and I will be staying there for certain on my next trip to New Orleans!"
"3986",3,"We were originally told that the room we booked ( the 2 BR suite above the office) had 1 1/2 bathrooms - no - it had one bathroom and it was an on suite to one of the bedrooms. This made it very award for two couples sharing the suite. In fact the couple using the large open concept room... More"
"3987",4,"The room was nice, but a bit small. The beds were supposed to be Queen Size, but were definitely smaller than Queen. The swimming pool was pretty small, too. Breakfast was pretty good."

"3989",4,"Rozsadny Hotel za bardzo dobra cene."
"3990",3,"The location of this hotel was amazing and the price was right. Unfortunately, it was a weekend and the hotel was hosting a wedding. As a result, it was very loud. I was assured by the staff that it would end around 10:30, but the party was yelling and slamming doors until at least 11:30. There was a note in my room to respect quiet time from 10p-6a, but I guess that applied only to me. I had an early morning event to attend, so I wouldn't recommend staying here on a weekend if you intend to get any rest. Also, my room had a shared bath, which was very poorly treated by whomever else was sharing it. Be advised that sometimes other guests might not be as civilized as you are."
"3991",5,"Bad: Floor to ceiling see through glass in bathroom. Good: Large floor to ceiling windows overlooking downtown. Chic design."
"3992",5,"Bad: Parking a little expensive.. Good: Close to TD Garden"
"3993",1,"Stay away from this place. It is a dirty roach Motel!! It seems like the place is more like low income housing for homeless people and drug users then a hotel for tourists-visitors. The rooms were dirty and smelled. There were people smoking weed and doing drugs in the parking lot. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
"3994",4,"Good: Location. Peace and quiet. Breakfast good, nice bar."
"3995",4,"Stayed in a King room with a pullout sofa for teen daughter. Shower pressure was great and room had a fridge. Had a lovely view of the lake and enjoyed watching the Kenmore float planes take off and land. The staff is excellent at this location. The bartender made some excellent recommendations for dinner. Ask for a coffee cup at the desk as they have complimentary Starbucks in the little market. Prices are expensive for a Courtyard but Seattle is an expensive town.Hello handwesh,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel.

"3996",4,"Husband and I planned to stop in Blythe as a rest/sleep stop on the way back from sedona. Very clean and comfortable place to lay your head for a night. Bountiful free breakfast as well. The checkin/out process seems to need some work but it's a new hotel so that is to be expected."

"3998",4,"We enjoyed the small family run motel. The room was a bit small, but well organized, and very clean. Quiet back street location. Attractive landscaped garden. Breakfast was meager and alternatives are a fair walk away. But I'd stay here again if in the area."

"4011",5,"We stayed at the King Charles Inn for one night. The staff was very welcoming and accomidating. The manager greeted us and checked on our satisfaction. The location was excellent. We would definitely recommend this hotel!"
"4012",3,"The beds, pillows and linens were fine. The A/C and other pipe noises were loud and you could hear everything going on in the hallway. The tub filled from a shower and took forever to drain. Furniture is worn and dated. Beach was great and so was the pool. For the price and since we knew we wouldn't be in the room much, it was okay but next trip to Virginia Beach we'll try a different place."

Again, thank you for promoting us on TripAdvisor. We look forward to hosting you during your next stay! Have a wonderful day!"
"4017",5,"This is a beautiful resort with great customer service. Prices in the restaurants are quite high, but quality is excellent. We attended the conference and enjoyed our stay. We would highly recommend this resort to families. Salt water pool, lazy river, live entertainment, beautiful and clean rooms, and of course, Hawaiian weather.. Five stars."
"4018",5,"We were greeted with smiles and the hokey pokey. Every effort was made to ensure we had everything we needed. A nice soft bed to sink into after an afternoon of workshops. Snacks were available, a dream come true for hungry teachers."

"4023",5,"We stayed in a newly renovated room. It was very clean and very comfortable. WiFi was free. There was an onsite computer for guest use. Breakfast was adequate. Coffee was good. The hotel, considering the room rate and proximity to ammenities, and cleanliness, it cannot be beat."
"4024",3,"These rooms are great if you're in town for a limited purpose, ie (business trip, seeing friends or family, etc). However, I don't recommend if you're looking for something fancy or romantic. It's a very old building and a little run-down. I wasn't wild about the location either. It's tucked away and kind of hard to get to if you're not familiar with the area. If you can get a deal through one of those sites out there, do it but it's definitely not worth what they tell you over the phone."
"4025",3,"Nothing particularly wrong with this hotel, but nothing stood out as great. Check-in/out was easy with friendly front desk staff.

The door was poorly hung, therefore you could see light, the bathroom fan was so loud you could not shower with the light on, there was a very thin and hole filled blanket on the bed, there was no coffee pot or microwave as promised, the fridge froze the contents, the carpet was gross on bare feet, and there were no hand towels only a wash cloth and bath towels. Was robbed by this stay. WAY more money than it was worth!!!!!"

The condos are well appointed, large and super comfortable - full upgraded kitchen, washer and dryer, 3 flat screen tvs, HUGE bathroom, plenty of closets, king bed, huge lanai with table and chairs.

"4032",2,"I stayed Monday through Friday on a business trip. When I checked in, I did a quick scan of the room, there was no refrigerator or microwave. I pulled the comforter back and noticed about 7 (what appeared to be) burn holes in the sheet, right by the pillow. I was moved to another room that had a small refrigerator and microwave. The room was dirty, cobwebs in the corner by the old A/C unit. The A/C was very loud and woke me up throughout the night when it would kick in. The chair in front of the unit was stained and not all the lights/fixtures were operational. The fitness area was a mess and the equipment was broken, cups on the floor, empty water container, and towels on the floor. Typical continental breakfast, sometimes there was coffee in the morning, but not every morning."
"4033",4,"Stay was enjoyable. Staff was well trained and courteous. Hotel was well maintained, clean, and organized. Room was very clean and desk was just right to work at after a long day.

"4040",1,"We were staying for one night for the BOA Marching band competition. I reviewed all the pictures online and read the reviews. You will always have mixed reviews. Based on the information I decided to book the night. The hotel lobby's door was broken. The front staff upon checking in were not personable. They provided us the room and upon entering that part of the hotel, it was not too clean and this had me worried. I had read about a newly renovated part of the hotel and prayed we would have it. No such luck. The room smelled, there was a dirty toothbrush in the corner of the room. There was also a burn mark on the carpet from an iron. I was so embarrased for my family that I actually booked this. We stayed anyway because I did not want to lose my money. Upon waking up my back hurt so bad I couldn't breathe. I could not wait to go home."
"4041",5,"This hotel is perfect for going to do all the fun things in Seattle at Seattle Center. You can walk to everything and there are many restaurants in the immediate area.Love everything about the hotel great service took care of all of our needs, the only thing that I would ask is that if they do have room to grant your request for late out. They have a policy absolutely no late checkouts which is OK. Not a dealbreaker.Debbie F,It was a pleasure to have you as our guest recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and it is exciting to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and inviting.

"4046",5,"My boyfriend and I were taking a road trip to Las Vegas (starting in MI), and we planned to stop in Chicago for a night. I found this hotel online and after seeing the location as well as the price, I was sold. When we arrived, the valet personnel were extremely helpful. They gave us a map to where we could self-park if we weren't interested in using valet, which was only about 2 blocks away. While he parked, I had someone assist me with our bags. They were quick and very friendly, telling me all the things we should do during our short stay. When I got to the room, everything was nice and clean, and though previous reviews say that the room is too small, I found that it was just what we needed for a night. The bed was comfortable, there was enough room to put our multiple bags/suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had a hand-held shower head, which was nice. We were visiting family that evening, so we wanted to bring a dessert to them. We asked (who I believe was) the manager there where the nicest/closest bakery was, and he told us about Magnolias. The desserts were incredible, a very good recommendation. The next morning, we ordered room service for breakfast from the restaurant downstairs because we were too comfy to even get out of bed. The food was brought up very quickly and was not too expensive at all, plus it was delicious. The only downside to the stay was that you have to pay for parking once again if you choose to leave and come back. However, everything else was great. There is a Starbucks right next door as well as several shopping stores within walking distance. The hotel staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with were all very kind and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for our next trip to Chicago."

"4079",2,"We have always been extremely satisfied with the Holiday Inn Express hotels that we have stayed in in the past, especially the breakfast buffets, and that was why we again chose a Holiday Inn Express when we were passing through the Baltimore area. Were we ever wrong on this one!! The buffet was very limited, hardly any hot items and what was supposed to be hot was actually stone cold (i.e. the gravy for the biscuits). The biscuits were rock hard. The scrambled eggs were a very bad version of imitation. Seemed like the person running the buffet was using week old biscuits and figured the warming lamps would heat up the gravy so she did not have to. I have never had a worse breakfast anywhere. If you are planning on getting your fill at this buffet - forget it. We had to go out to breakfast after checking out just to keep from starving. We hadn't balked at the room fee because we assumed the buffet would be worth the extra money - Boy were we wrong!!"

"4087",4,"We were very surprised at how the place had been updated. The service was very efficient and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable - the bed itself could have been better, but then the rates would probably been higher. The neighborhood was not the best and there were very few places to eat or pick up needed food or sundries. They are a pet friendly chain, which we liked if we choose to travel with our in the future. All in all, we liked the Red Roof and found it to be better than we expected."
"4088",4,"The location was perfect -- easy to find and suited our needs for our activities while in town. Check-in was easy, people were nice, the room was clean. It's not fancy, but given the alternatives in Napa (very pricey), it suited our needs. (We had two rooms, and our relatives had a third.) There's no getting around that this is a Best Western, with Denny's as the anchor restaurant. Clean, no frills, convenient. No more, no less.Annhurst - I am pleased to hear that our hotel suited all your needs. We are thrilled you got everything you needed in your visit to Napa. Come visit us again soon."

"4097",4,"The Central Loop Hotel is in the middle of the hustle bustle of downtown Chicago. They offer a lovely sitting room for visitors to enjoy a cup of coffee and visit with other travelors which we found a plus while using Chicago as a central meeting place for an annual get together with my husbands family. The hotel is very clean and the staff excellent, working to make your vist the best it can be. The restaurant in the hotel had good food with great coffee making it a good choice for a convenient breakfast. The rooms are average, but very clean, although we found them a bit stingy with linnens offering just one towel per person. The best part of this hotel is the location making it within walking distance of the museums and shopping. I highly recommend this hotel if you are ok with staying in a busy, central location."
"4098",5,"This was the second time I had stayed in this hotel. The first time I stayed it was still under the Southern Cross Hotel management group. I chose this hotel the first time due to its location, but after staying noticed it could have used some updating however the location made up for that. Well now that The Saint has rebranded this hotel it is truly the best value in Key West with top notch amenities along with the awesome location.On this trip we stayed with family and friends and this hotel meet our needs perfectly. I do think this hotel is also great for a more romantic getaway. It definitely has that modern romantic feel, but also suit family's as well. Very well done.The staff is among the nicest we have encountered in Key West and they really go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. We will definitely be staying here in the future and I highly recommend you give this hotel a shot on your next trip to Key West. You won't be disappointed.Thank you for letting us know how much you enjoyed your recent stay at The Saint Hotel! We appreciate your positive comments on our staff and hotel atmosphere. We are so glad that you found it conveniently located to everything! We hope you will come visit us again. Thank you again for your review."

"4101",4,"Well, there's lots of things I could say about this nice, modern hotel right across the street from the aquarium, Centennial Olympic Park and numerous restaurants.

Beds were very comfortable and the free admission to the indoor waterpark was awesome. I think very highly of this hotel."

Rooms clean and comfortable. Good parking available. Well located in the town. Everything we needed and much more. Exceptional value!"
"4105",3,"We chose this hotel based on location and cost. Traditionally we prefer hotels that have more comfort and amenities. The Pros:Location (is really excellent)QuietFriendly staffTasty restaurant downstairsThe Cons:The bed/bedding not horrible, but I just couldn't get a good night's sleepOur room smelled faintly of smokeThe elevator took foreverIt was all really just 'good enough.' It was the location that mattered most in the end. It was very easy to walk to almost all of our sight seeing destinations."

"4108",5,"I was lucky to be upgraded to a lovely Jr suite with great views of the lake and park. Unfortunately, I was only in town for 24 hours so I couldn't fully enjoy the hotel."
"4109",3,"I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team"
"4110",5,"Short stay and close to metro. The hotel shuttle to the metro station was great."
"4111",5,"Hotel Red is a stylish and comfortable hotel in Madison, right near campus. It is the nicest hotel in the area and has all the amenities. There is off street parking. I only had a short stay, but I found the room very quiet and comfortable."
"4112",4,"Overall the staff, hotel cleanliness and the amenities like breakfast was up to my satisfaction. Even though the Hotel had signs apologizing for renovations I am so happy that we didn't hear or had any complaints concerning the renovations. We didn't even notice the people or rooms being renovated. My stay was enjoyable with piece and quiet all around just like I love my stays. The only complaint which wasn't a big issue for me was the slow internet service provided. Although it was complimentary free wifi, I think I would of paid a few dollars for quicker faster internet wifi services on my stay. No biggie if you don't need it. The bed was more comfortable than I had expected I give you guys 5stars on comfort and cleanliness! I will be coming back here on my next stay!"
"4113",5,"This hotel offers clean rooms, great service and is within walking distance of everything in Bricktown. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Parking is a little tricky when trying to locate the elevators. Otherwise, it was a nice hotel. Would definitely recommend!"
"4114",5,"Bad: The last night there was a prom. I guess one of the parties decided to continue in to the night next door. Loud talking and slamming of the doors,up until 3 am. The desk knew about it when I called but nothing was done. I will never stay there again, paying so much and living like a Days Inn. All the desk could say was they were sorry. Good: The staff and extras were good. The room was nice and view was good. Comfortable room. Loved the crabby evening activities."
"4115",2,"First of all, the staff was very nice. However, I was very disappointed in this hotel. The rooms are supposed to be 100 percent smoke free, but the smoke smell hit the second I walked in the room. I called the front desk to ask to be transferred to another room but none were available. The front desk kindly offered... More"

If you are looking for a low key, private and relaxing honeymoon or family trip this is the place for you. My wife and I stayed in a studio on the 8th floor for 5 nights and... More"
"4118",3,"Price was a little bit deceptive...when I booked the room, it stated that breakfast is included. However, it is not included in the quoted rate...you are charged an additional 9.95 per day (mandatory) for 2 bottles of water and the breakfast, plus use of the fitness center. Since this is mandatory, it should be included in the overall rate. The room was fine but there was a funny, fishy smell in the hallway on my floor. Not sure what that was all about."
"4119",1,"I would never stay at this hotel again. My room in the south tower, 1927 was filthy dirty and it looked like the carpets had not been cleaned in years.

"4122",1,"I was trying to save money when I booked a room here for three nights. The only good thing I can say is it was inexpensive. The bathroom sink was literally falling off the wall.

"4124",4,"The Troubadour is a couple blocks outside the Quarter which is ideal for driving in and out while there's parades happening. The studio room we had was spacious and comfortable. Nice big shower his and her vanity. Though it had somewhat unsettling, disturbing artwork on the walls. The rooftop bar has a great view of the city but it's sadly not accessible 24/7 but only from 5 pm till last call. They should change that as I'm sure it would be equally enjoyable during the day. The drinks are extremely overpRiced. You're better off bringing your own drinks. I also would've liked to see a pool and whirlpool there but there wasn't. The restaurant had delicious breakfast and pastries and the servers were friendly and accommodating. A couple cons: The carpets in the room looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in awhile and a couple days they didn't stock enough towels or tissue. Also be careful to not leave valuables out, even food. We left some freshly boxed muffins on the desk that we intended to eat later but found they had been taken when we returned to the room hours later. The elevators kept malfunctioning that even the staff found inconvenient. The acting manager, Toriano, the first shift front desk people were extremely friendly, patient, competent and professional and compensated for any mishaps we experienced. They offered us a great deal for Mardi Gras weekend compared to the other hotels in the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel while visiting the city.Thank you for your comments, they are very important to us. They allow us to celebrate our successes, and also look for opportunities to improve. We will certainly share the details with our management team to make sure housekeeping is doing a more thorough job while cleaning the rooms while also taking care with guest items. We apologize you experienced these deficiencies. We thank you for taking the time to share and we are excited to see you again in the future.WayneGeneral Manager"
"4125",2,"We decided to stay a few extra days in Vegas and found a good offer at the Suncoast, plus we wanted to spend our mornings hiking in Red Rock. The positives: economical, close to Red Rock, large pool, lots of parking, large rooms, nice staff. Negatives: old, the carpets are shaggy like the atmosfere in general. In the end we wound up just sleeping and spending the afternoons on the Strip, which takes 30 minutes by car.Thank you for your review. Sounds like you enjoyed most of your stay, and you will be pleased we are going through a full scale remodel of our hotel rooms. I think you will be pleased with our new rooms, and we look forward to your future stay. Have a nice day."

We booked the room thinking that it had a view of the creek. We were really wanting to see and hear it from our room. The title of creek side was very misleading.

"4148",4,"I stayed at Aloft while attending a convention. It fulfilled all I sought. A modern and well run newer hotel away from the citys congestion well suited for a business traveler. It is a 15 minute walk to the convention center or you can take a shuttle one block away. Easy walk to the French Quarter. The rooms are sufficient and contemporary. Housekeeping was spot on and ranks high for cleanliness. The rooms start on the 11th floor so you are well above street traffic. I would suggest as others have to request a corner room with windows to avoid the cruise ship interior cabin feeling if you need it. Nice bar with specials and the rooftop pool is relaxing. Special mention needs to be extended to the hotels outstanding front desk staff specifically, Lindsey and Mark (who also worked the bar). Friendly, savvy, hardworking, and patient- they belong in hotel hospitality and deserve recognition. Their inherent superior communication skills exceed standard service training programs. I happily recommend this lodging while in NOLA!Our staff will be elated to hear of your stay with us. From housekeeping to the front desk and even the bar, it sounds like you enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. We hope to be your hotel of choice when in the Big Easy.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"

"4159",5,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for a week, and ended up spending one of those days in the room completely, due to her falling sick with food poisoning. The hotel was clean, comfortable and had a nice breakfast area. People have complained that it is small (which it is) but breakfast can be taken back to your room, which I preferred. There is a computer/printer available to print out tickets/boarding passes and this was very useful as we needed to print out some tickets to Six Flags in order to take advantage of an online-only deal. We visited the Parkstone Grille restaurant once (on the first night) and found it really nice. It was during a Karaoke night, so it was quite lively and everyone loved my english accent (although I didn't sing!) I wish I'd booked two weeks here as the time flew by so fast, and I already want to go back. I would book here again, although the location is a bit awkward if you plan to visit Baltimore on a daily basis (it's a good 30 minute drive each way) but it was close to Arundel Mill Shopping Mall, and some other amenities (such as the Airport)"

I hate the strip hotels/traffic, this is a great alternative to the strip but within minutes if you are going to the strip or any where else in Vegas and minutes from the airport and only a minute from the freeway. Quiet, clean, comfortable and nice staff."
"4169",5,"What a wonderful find. A lovely hotel with superb staff who provide excellent service and make you feel very welcome. Fantastic rooms for the price and spotless. Peter at front of house is a wonderful representative who could do equally as well in a top London Hotel. He was impeccable. Location was only a short walk from seafront and there... More"
"4170",4,"Great stay last night. Room was spacious and clean. The TV didn't have a lot of channel options. The ladies at the front desk were very friendly. Parking was an extra 9 per day that I wasn't aware of. Breakfast was average."
"4171",5,"Bad: The bed wasn't that comfy, which was surprising given all of the other amazing details. Sheets were rough/stiff- not cozy. Could be easily fixed, though!. Good: This was by far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. Check-in and check-out was super fast, staff was phenomenal, and the room was very intuitively set-up with thoughtful details technology. It was clear that Virgin isn't just a typical hotel. The chamber set-up of the room allowed for privacy comfort, even in a relatively small space. Snacks mini-bar had 7-11 prices. Everything was super clean, well serviced and wonderful. In short: STAY HERE!"
"4172",5,"Very nice quiet rooms (all separated) with their own courtyard. Very friendly staff. Short walk to town and wine tasting!"

"4176",5,"Bad: Nothing to dislike awesome stay. Good: Really liked the modern feel to the place ! Nice looking spot, so I kinda look like a bum when I travel so not to attract crime or Theves . And I usually travel around walking and exploring so I travel light aka bum looking ... the staff was very friendly to me . The room was awesome nice touches classical music playing after a shower and some music I was rejuvenated and went to the bar an had great conversation really a good memory to my trip I'd defiantly stay here again like the small hotel appeal . Great stay ."
"4177",4,"Bad: Expensive but all of south beach is. . Good: Location"

"4183",5,"This is an excellent property. It really fits the resort catagory. The king bed I had was very comfortable and the room had enough space to relax and work. Evry room has a balcony.

"4187",5,"Great new hotel with amazing access to shopping and some nightlife - not to mention day time beach trips! If you get a higher floor you can see the entire boardwalk and down the coast in both directions. Pretty funny to watch the great HB police case off the night time beach goers!"
"4188",5,"Hands down, the best hotel I've ever stayed! Helpful and friendly staff. Cozy and well kept rooms. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. Also, very easy to get to. The wait staff at the Irish Pub attatched to the hotel makes you feel a part of their family. I can't wait to come back!"
"4189",5,"At check in, the staff was most friendly and helpful. There only one night, my suite was clean and comfortable. Beds were very good (wimpy pillows though). Only negative was the noise of another's air conditioning unit running for hours. That type of noise should not be heard at all! Overall, I would recommend Springhill Suites!!"
"4190",5,"Loved the breakfast!!"
"4191",3,"My wife and I selected this hotel to attend a Cowboys game. This hotel was reasonably priced, was convenient to expressways, restaurants and shopping, free wifi, parking and breakfast.

"4195",5,"Wife and I wanted to stay in a hotel on the beach with smoking accomodations inside the room. We found this hotel to not only be comfortable, but very very clean and spacious. It reminded us of our stay in the residence inn in California. Would definately recommend to others in this location."
"4196",5,"Great experience. Friendly, helpful staff."
"4197",1,"We had 10 rooms asked the GM in advance to put the rooms close she said she would do her best. At check in, the front desk never received anything from their GM about our group. The hotel was dirty, online pics are deceiving. The rooms reeked of smoke some of us changed rooms. There was hair everywhere. I never saw a cleaning lady the entire time. There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out. This is not a family friendly hotel in any way, shape or form, DO NOT bring your kids here. If you want a cheap party hotel with a club where you can pass out drunk not care, this is right up your alley. Do yourself a favor spend the extra money."
"4198",5,"We enjoyed our lunch at the St. Regis. From the service to the food and drink, everything was impeccable. The setting is classic and polished, comfortable and beautiful. It was our first time at the St. Regis and we will return. Highly recommended.Dear mnkittycat, Thank you so much for having lunch at The St. Regis New York.

"4201",1,"Bad experience. Most of the employees live at the hotel. Lady bartender was great but apparently the system in the restaurant went down all weekend so no food and very inconvenient to leave hotel to get food as the hotel is tucked way off in an industrial park. Room stank like feet, bathroom had stains on the wall, light fixtures nearly falling off the wall, carpets were very stained. Overall horrible hotel"

"4203",3,"Dirty carpet, dirty bathroom flooring. One light out in the bathroom. Poor lighting in the room bathroom for applying make-up. Wall of windows should have black out curtains and shades. Walking in tot he cornstalk it smells like Pot Smoking 4 days out of the 6 we stayed."

"4213",5,"From the moment we checked in to our last minute there, the service was world class. The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY.

"4219",5,"I travel extensively and normally visit at least three states per month for work. Hilton family hotels are my preference when I travel and I have stayed at a lot of them.

"4221",4,"I have 4 teens. So there were 6 of us in a room. That get cramped! This two bedroom suite had 2 (!) bathrooms and a kitchen. NO one slept on the floor. It was awesome! Tons of room to spread out, we weren't tripping over each other."

"4223",3,"Bad: The hotel is very tired - could use an update. Now, I understand why such a deal. Can not figure out higher rating given to it overall. Good: Location was in the middle of the Freemont Experience."
"4224",4,"Bad: The minibar and the heating were noisy, but it didn't really disrupt our sleep. Breakfast was good, but perhaps the avocado toast was a bit small for the price. Good: The staff were all friendly and professional. Our room was clean and warm (it was cold out!) and had everything we needed. The drinks and food were very good, especially the Finch burger and the crab bennies at breakfast. Overall, we really liked the feel of the hotel and would definitely stay again, especially if we were going out of North Station again which is just around the corner."
"4225",3,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. It's better than the reviews depict. We really appreciated Gary and all of his advice regarding the hotel and the city! ***just prepare to pay for parking. We weren't expecting this.. Roughly 27 per day"
"4226",3,"The first room we got was soaking wet. we called the front desk. The front desk clerk got us another room. We didn't care for the noise from the road near by. If you stay there don't stay in room 225. I wanted to stay down stairs they didn't have any rooms."

"4228",5,"Bad: We had a ground unit and was unable to sleep until 11 pm every night because of the family above us had a kid that ran from 7 am to 11 pm for 3 nights.

"4238",4,"Great staff at this hotel. It's in a nice location too. The hotel is dated, but I very much enjoyed the breakfast at Denny's (ask for Ceci) as Best Western will give rewards members a free breakfast or 6.00 off another breakfast entree at Denneys. Bertha was fantastic as check in. She accommodated my special requests and took me to 3 rooms to let me decide as I told her I was super picky. Pierre and Michael and Darby were also super kind and helpful. Michael is very knowledgeable about wineries. Darby helped me with restaurants, and Pierre was also helpful and offered any additional assistance he could. Pierre had coffee made SUPER early which is great as I was up at 4 or 4:30 each day. It was nice he was there to greet me and there was decaf and coffee made early. They need to update the rooms, but the business center was nice with 2 computers and the exercise room and laundry facility was all right there too--super convenient. The price was high, but I guess all the prices are high at Napa. I'd recommend the location too. Thanks!"

"4245",5,"We booked in here due to an early morning flight. It was a little more expensive than what we usually pay for when staying at a hotel but it was definitely worth it. Very lovely clean room, and the staff were very helpful and polite. The only downside was (upon checking out) the early morning shuttle driver was running a little late, and due to the amount of people and luggage, was stressed and became rude when trying to squeeze the last few people on the shuttle......however the shuttle driver the day before was very friendly and helpful so it all evened itself out."

"4254",1,"Terrible. I spent my last penny reserving my room and i didn't see anything about a deposit under the small print tab, so I thought I was all paid up. Suddenly, after having spent nearly half an hour checking-in with their highly unprofessional staff just before I was given my keys so I could go find my room, the room keys didn't work on my room. So I walked all the way to the lobby, this time with my bags in tow, only to find out that they deactivated my room keys because they weren't able to charge card for incidentals. Which is when I said, of course not...I spent my last penny reserving this place online and there was no mention of a deposit in your 'small print' tab online. Every room I've reserved through Hotels.com, that has charged me a deposit, mentioned a deposit or incidentals charge in their small tab. Well I cancelled my reservation and asked for my money back so I could rent another room elsewhere. The manager cancelled my reservation and stated that he would be refunding my money, but he never did. I was not able to rent another room...I was broke."

The morning breakfast changed its entree every morning and the coffee was delicious and available all day. The housekeeping staff is very thorough and the room was beautiful. I would highly recommend this Hampton Inn to anyone looking for location and an extremely clean and well appointed place to stay at a very affordable price. This will be our go to hotel whenever we visit family in Maryland."

"4276",5,"Great Customer Service. Nice Place and rooms were cleaned and uptodate"
"4277",5,"Lovely hotel with an amazing rooftop bar. The rooftop bar is on the 17th floor looks out over the city with couches and sitting areas besides a big bar to sit at. Rooms were decorated nicely with a touch of orange as the signature color. Bellmen and concierge were very helpful with good advice for where to go. It's in walking distance of Bourbon St but wear comfortable shoes There is lots of walking and sidewalks are uneven most everywhere you go. Of course, taxis and Uber are available. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. Happy Birthday!!! We appreciate you sharing your comments for others to get a feel of The Troubadour and our Monkey Board rooftop bar, we are excited to hear you enjoyed the atmosphere up there. The team will enjoy reading your comments and we thank you for recognizing all their hard efforts. We look forward to seeing you again soon, at least before your next birthday!WayneGeneral Manager"
"4278",5,"The staff was friendly, professional and helpful. The accommodations were clean and convenient to all the local attractions."
"4279",3,"My daughter and I stay here on our way to California. Our was nice, our room was clean and very pleasant. The location of the hotel was very close to I-10. However as the night progress and more guest arrived, we could hear footsteps above us as the guest walked around. Also we had a non-smoking room, but we could smell cigarette smoke from our restroom."

The staff was very courteous and professional. We ate at the hotel restaurant and found the food to be excellent. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that is staying in the area."

"4287",5,"The hotel was nice for a weekend getaway. Nice staff and clean room. The best part was the full kitchen, which had everything you would need to cook and eat, all you need is to supply the food."
"4288",5,"Staff was very nice and friendly, quick check in and check out, good variety offered for breakfast, good location. Only inconvenience on the weekend our family stayed there was a convention happening at the hotel on the Friday evening which made the lobby area were crowded and noisy."
"4289",5,"This hotel is excellent, very clean inside out. I was given a massive room with a kitchen which was well stocked. Service was great and staff very friendly. The hotel is also located in a good place in walking distance of plenty of restaurants and a Starbucks. Will use again"
"4290",3,"This motel looks like it was once a family gathering place. There is an old swing set and gazebo. The theatre theme in the rooms is giving way to an update of the decor. The motel was our stopover between dives on the Osprey. There is not much choice in town unless you look to a bed and breakfast or... More"
"4291",5,"This property provided us with an extremely enjoyable stay, the beds were excellent, the dcor and cleanliness excellent. the food outstanding, our BEST stay at a Best Western. If we are ever in this neck of the woods again, we will definitely stay at this Best Western."
"4292",1,"The room smelled terrible of smoke even though it said no smoke hotel. There were ashes on the floor! And drunk men wandering around outside! The the hallways had trash in them. It was dirty and unclean!"
"4293",4,"We arrived by chance at the St.Regis after the Waldorf failed to provide us with an updated room. The St. Regis was very beautifully appointed and the front desk staff was very accommodating as well. We needed a larger room as we were having guests joins us for dessert and drinks and although there was an additional charge 1,000 more for the room, it was just what we needed and really pretty. The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark. If you book a room at the St. Regis, make sure to ask for a high floor or you will be in darkness, despite the wonderful dcor and amenities.Dear Dirwpgops, Thank you for taking the time to detail your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your larger room but are dissapointed that you were not pleased with the view. Should you ever encounter this again, kindly contact our Front Desk team to see if we have alternative options for you. Thank you again and we hope to see you again soon.With warm regards,Pedro RodriguezDirector of Front Office"
"4294",4,"Suncoast is off the strip about 20-30 minutes depending on how you drive. Vegas is easy to get around if you do rent a car. I have stayed in several LV hotels both on and off the strip but I honestly can say I was surprised at how nice the rooms were. The views are spectacular - mountains and golf courses- very peaceful. I'm a corner checker - I hate to see dirt in the corners of the bathrooms - every square inch was spotless! The crisp snow white bed covers reassured me of the cleanliness. We felt like we had a suite by both the size and the amenities. As we kept late nights we wanted to sleep The choice of restaurants is nicely varied and even has a Seattle's Best for the coffee drinker. They bring in some great music bands. I can't say enough about the well mannered and pleasant staff. Despite the line up check in was quick and pleasant. Loved the pool hot tub with the views of the mountains. Close to great shopping (5 min walk) , 15 minute from Red Rock Canyon State Park( rock climbing, varied degrees of hiking easy to tough), 20 min to Bonnie Springs (rustic restaurant, zoo fun for all ages) I would recommend this hotel without reservation!"
"4295",4,"This hotel recently went through an update in regards to the furniture and televisions. I have to say that they did a great job. They didn't. however, replace the tile in the bathrooms to match the rest of the updates, which is a shame. The tub and pedestal sink looked new, but the toilet did not. But I have to say, that the bathroom was the cleanest I have ever seen. Not even one stray hair on the floor! The kitchen also skipped the update, but it was still nice to have a fridge, microwave and stove. All the essential items like utensils, dinnerware and cookware were stocked in the cabinets. Also, there is no wi-fi in the rooms, you have to go to the lobby. There is only a plug for high speed internet located in the room. The hotel is a great bargain for staying near D.C. and I would stay there in a heartbeat."
"4296",5,"Good: Best sleep I've had at a hotel"
"4297",4,"Hotel was very clean, nice amenities, friendly staff. However, the transportation company they partner with are less than honest. They sell you a round trip transportation to cruise port for 60, and then the hotel tries to charge an additional 32 to go to the port."
"4298",4,"Great location to the beach and boardwalk. Nice to have a kitchen. Would have liked to have stayed for a few more days. Try to get an inside room. Though we did have a slice of the ocean view, the lights of the business on the other side of the alley was on all night."
"4299",4,"We were in the area for a Cody Jinks concert (he's wonderful is you've never heard of him) and the location was perfect. It is located downtown on Fannin, so also a good location for anyone that might be in Houston for one of the hospitals. Hotel was also very aesthetically pleasing so kudos to whoever is in charge of decor. Rooms were small but other than that I have no complaints. Good bang for your buck and customer service was wonderful!"
"4300",5,"Sirea and Sylvia were awesome, both deserve a raise. Both totally went out of their way to help me with anything I needed. And made my stay enjoyable and not so lonely by striking up conversations with me. Which means a lot when you are away from home. The rest of the staff was wonderful as well. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Will retun."
"4301",4,"New hotel in a new housing subdivision. Very close to relative's home. No food available, after continental breakfast. Nicely decorated."
"4302",5,"Good: Only a block off the strip. Luxurious feeling room. Excellent value!"
"4303",5,"Overall the hotel is ok, except we had to ride for about 30-45 mins to find a decent resturant because the one that was located at the hotel was closed due to a family reunion. Because of the convienence of the resturant was part of the reason why i stayed and once we got there and they said that someone had reserved it we were very disappointed."
"4304",4,"The Fairfield Inn Tracy is located close to the highway. Therefore road noise can be heard. However, the hotel is clean and the staff is excellent. The noise will not wake you or annoy you but it is there. Close to shopping and restaurants. The Hampton Inn is across the parking lot and has the same noise issue."
"4305",5,"One of the best places you will ever stay in New Orleans. Absolutely delightful and right in the middle of the quarter but far enough away from the noise. This exceptional Hotel has been around for a very long time and there is a reason. Pure beauty and fabulous staff."
"4306",4,"LOVED IT!!!"
"4307",4,"Clean rooms and generally quiet made for good sleeping. The breakfast in the morning with eggs and waffles just can't be built. I have stayed here for 3 nights each week for the last 3 weeks and will continue to do that for the next 3 weeks. The prices are reasonable and I have recommended this hotel to my co-workers (who have also stayed here at times now)."
"4308",5,"It was a wonderful experience.the room is nice, clean and spacious. The location is accessible to shoppers and they have a hotel service to the airport."

"4318",5,"Outstanding Hotel. After spending the day at Inner Harbor, we spent the night at BWI's Hilton Garden Inn. The staff was very friendly and helped us find a good place to eat. The rooms were very comfortable and very clean. The whole hotel, itself, was very well maintained."

"4322",5,"My hotel stay at the Hilton Garden Inn can only be described as over the top excellent. I was warmly welcomed by a wonderful front desk clerk named Jennifer who demonstrated exemplary customer service. The hotel was absolutely gorgeous and smelled wonderful - seriously. I stayed in a Jr. Suite and found the room to be comfortable, super clean, and well appointed. My only complaint, and it is relatively small, is that the breakfast buffet wasn't that great especially given the price. When I mentioned this upon check-out I was promptly given a Barnes Noble gift card in an effort to make up for my less than satisfactory restaurant experience. Was I impressed You bet!!!! I have never received such wonderful customer service during any hotel stay as I did at the Hilton Garden Inn. I will ALWAYS make it a point to stay at this hotel each time I visit family in the area."
"4323",5,"Great location close to the stadium but far enough away from the craziness. Nice staff and well maintained hotel. Love the free evening drinks and breakfast in the morning."
"4324",4,"Stayed at this property to avoid staying in New Jersey. Very pleased with the property, about 5 miles off I 95, but there are two good places to eat within walking distance. Very clean property, with three floors, elevator, pool, hot tub. Rooms are spacious and clean, furniture is modern. Very quiet, staff was very pleasant and helpful, breakfast area... More"
"4325",5,"A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new, white-clad, 36-room property located steps from Duval Street, the main drag in Key West. Staff seem a bit over-taxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals, room service, taxis, and logistics. Service was excellent, starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo, who is helpful, not to mention easy on the eyes. Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents. Blue lighting predominates on the exterior, too. Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lap-style pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end. Careful - they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple. My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable, and was part of the new remodel/construction. You may want to request a newer room. The location cannot be beat. It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street. Through a side gate you step right onto Duval. Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days. Go right and there are more of the same, including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only 4 to 6 blocks away. I walked to the marina for several excursions, to the southernmost point and south beaches. The hotel has bikes available at no charge. I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and far-off marinas for some of my excursions. Overall, this property served me well. Its common spaces are chic and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and the people working there make things as easy as possible.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time and the amenities of our property! We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to our employees so that they know their hard work is appreciated. Please, come back and see us!"

"4363",3,"Got off to a rocky start as the room was not ready at our check in time, guaranteed late check in. This was at 10pm on a Sunday night! The lobby was full of customers who could not check in also, at least 7 different reservations where being held up. Front desk staff had to leave check the rooms to see if they had been cleaned at 10:30! Thankful, my room was ready by then, not sure how the others made out as I wasn't sticking around to hear the complaints. The breakfast consist of powered scrambled eggs, powered egg cheese omelette, under or over cooked bacon, link or patty sausage (only one meat a day, fruit that was not fresh, and broken waffle, coffee, other machines during the week. It's food with zero taste. One of the two elevators has been out of service for the entire 8 days I have been here. The maids did do a good job cleaning the room every day. The picture on the website for the pool is a straight out lie yes, it has a pool, and no, it is only a average to small pool in size. More than 15 guest at any times makes it a little jammed. Overall, it's a room a bed."
"4364",4,"This is a nice hotel in a good location close to some shopping and several food options. Because of its setup, it is pretty quiet at night which is nice considering it's on a main drag. The woman at the main desk was very pleasant and got us checked in quickly with no wait. It was around 8:00pm when we got there.The room was spacious and clean which is always appreciated especially at a reasonable price. My only complaint was that the ice machine on our floor was broken and most of the drink selections were empty so we had to go back down to the main floor to find what we were looking for.The breakfast was decent for the price we paid. There was fruit, yogurt, eggs, cereal, juice, bagels and waffles. The standard spread that one would expect. The food was continually stocked which was nice. My only complaint was the seating was very limited. There was not enough room for the amount of people showing up to breakfast, so we and a couple other groups had to stand for a while until someone offered us a seat.There also is a pool at this hotel which looked nice, but unfortunately, I didnt get to try it out. But from the looks of the people out on the patio, people loved it and it looked very well kept.I would definitely stay here again!"

However they did take care of the barking dog next door immediately and it stopped for the rest of the night. That only happened once in all my stays.It still looks brand new on the inside. Highly recommend this hotel."

"4370",5,"Nice hotel in SLO. staff was friendly and they had cookies and coffee when we checked in. Only minor complaint was the continental breakfast was a little on the light side. But there are plenty of places to eat in SLO so other than that it was great."
"4371",1,"Service was terrible, could not get any one on the phone to ask questions, there was only one GSR in the lobby. the breakfast was cold, room was dirty, floor never vacuumed, only one bar of soap, only one set of towels of each size"
"4372",5,"Need a little more turkey items on the menu everyone doesn't always eat pork."
"4373",5,"I stayed in 809, and it was an absolute blast. The view and overall feeling of the suite exactly what I needed. Treat yourself to it, and walk the hotel to view a ton of local art. It's everything I want in a downtown hotel. Beautiful design, comfy rooms, that wow factor, local focused, and friendly staff.Thank you so much for this awesome review! We hope you'll come back and stay with us again soon."
"4374",5,"Good: Great staff, superb rooms, brilliant location."
"4375",4,"Close to all the beautiful beaches. Resort appears outdated from the outside but pretty nice inside the rooms. Tiki bar is the gem of the resort, what a fun time. Would come back for sure. Bath tub was a little gross, shower head was shady but sht happens!"
"4376",3,"Was only there to shower before hitting the road back home but the rooms were nice and clean. There were minor flaws such as dings and dents here and there but other than that it was a basic hotel."
"4377",5,"Great service, safe and overall excellent. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The young lady at the front desk printed some directions for me. The location was perfect, right by the freeway. I would stay again."
"4378",4,"I stayed here on a work trip for 8 nights. My room was clean, breakfast was nice, staff was friendly! I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I also like the fact, that it's off of the busy street. But it only walking distance to the beach. They also do valet services which is nice."
"4379",5,"Bad: I didn't appreciate the attitude of a few of the female employees in regards to the nightclub. I also would prefer a little more variety in the DJ's music choice. It seemed like ALL techno versions and sometimes we just want to hear the ACTUAL songs mixed. Other than that, I loved the property. Good: I loved the decor. Everything about the hotel from the lobby to the room was fantastic. The wood floors, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the shower overlooking the bedroom... PHENOMENAL! I loved the modern, but still comfortable feel. All employees I came in contact with had fantastic customer service skills with the exception of a few in the nightclub. Overall, this property is definitely on my list of Chicago properties as we visit often. Next time we will try out the spa as we didn't get a chance this visit."
"4380",5,"Was in town for business, stayed only 1 night. By far one of the best HIE i have stayed at! Whenever i travel i tend to stay at them. It is not that often and usually not in larger cities.

"4381",3,"Check in service was slow. Personnel were rude. Smoking room was given to two non-smokers. Strong smell in room even with air conditioner running non-stop."
"4382",5,"Friendly,clean and great coffee and cake with fresh fruit in the morning. The location of the rooms are conveniently across from police and Fire houses. The rates are affordable. Mark also has maps and pamphlets for guests that want to see the wonderful sites of New Hampshire. I would definitely return next year."
"4383",5,"This hotel was in a terrific location.  Walking distance from all sights.  The hotel staff was very accommodating. We arrived very early in the morning and they had a room for us.  Our flight out was late in the day, so they held our luggage and also called for our cab service to the airport, which arrived right on schedule."
"4384",3,"Compared to our stay in Washington DC and Savannah, both of which were historic buildings, the hotel did not meet our expectations. It was very expensive and although it was an historic hotel, room was dated and needed an update."
"4385",5,"The staff here was wonderful! Got us thru a rough time due to a funeral for a loved one coupled with the worst snow storm in the area in years! They went above and beyond with their great service and making us feel at home during a difficult time. Will definitely stay there again the next time we are in... More"

"4391",1,"I booked this room for one of my drivers and am appalled at what she reported back to me. The first room had a broken tv that wasn't even connected to the electric/cable. So as not to be blamed for the damage she requested a new room. She was given keys to another room and as she entered the room, somebody was already sleeping in it!! She apologized and went back to the front desk to request a 3rd room. She refused to go to the room without the agent going first to make sure everything was ok with it. The agent complied and came back and issued her the key. Everything seemed ok till she went in the restroom and found the toilet full of what should have flushed away! She called the front desk and reported it but nothing was done about it. This is no way to run a railroad and I won't put any of my drivers there again!!"
"4392",5,"I always return to the Varden when traveling to south LA and Orange County. The location is convenient and centrally located, parking is easy, service is great, and the hotel and rooms are extremely clean."
"4393",5,"Bad: None. Good: My overall experience was great!"
"4394",1,"A nice clean casino with affordable restaurants. However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action."
"4395",5,"It was a good clean stay."
"4396",3,"The hotel is very basic but the room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. After staying at other Best Western hotels, this hotel could include many more amenties. The hotel had an odor that was not pleasing, 1 of 2 elavators was out of service. Breakfast items were plentiful but the staff could not keep up during peak times and the buffet area got very messy. The front desk service employees were helpful and polite. I would not go back to this hotel inspite of the good price."
"4397",3,"Bad: At breakfast, could not keep up with demand."
"4398",5,"My stay was great. The staff was friendly and welcoming and I even got a gift bag which made it a plus! I would recommend to anyone."
"4399",3,"Room was clean. Hotel located at a busy intersection. Windows were so outdated, every outside noise was heard. A lot of traffic noise. AC unit kept coming on snd off so frequently, it kept us awake. Initially when we arrived, no one was at the desk. Had to wait several minutes before being helped."
"4400",1,"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager"

"4406",4,"The continental breakfast had a waffle maker - always a nice addition."
"4407",4,"Built in 1898 this hotel has some charm. Priced like one of the new, right off the freeway type hotels, this one is special. Downtown, small old town with lots of history and plenty of good shopping and restaurants."
"4408",2,"We checked in and noticed an odor similar to cat urine in first floor room. I called front desk, they contacted housekeeping and she came immediately to spray and request an ozone something. I called front desk back and asked for another room. They did not have one with two queens so we took a king. The front desk asked if we wanted a roll away and I said yes. We left for dinner and when we returned, no rollaway. I did not call desk back. All of us crammed on the king bed."
"4409",3,"Definitely not worthy for over 500 pernight with additional 35 parking . The room is small and the offer is limited. The location is great thought , just right across street from the pier ."

By the time she left, we had a really great of idea of what we wanted for our wedding invitations. Her... Read More relationships with multiple stationers allowed us to get our Letterpress invitations for almost a third of what we were quoted at other stationary vendors. Once the proof review started, Kristen was on our side as we had to work through a few design issues with our vendor. Kristen made sure we got exactly what we wanted despite having to go through four revisions to get the design just right. Our invitations turned out perfectly.

"4417",4,"Staff was awesome, location was great and it was a great value compared to other hotels in downtown Charleston. Parking is so bad in Charleston its worth staying somewhere on the peninsula so you don't have to try and find parking. Hotel offered very convenient valet service too."
"4418",4,"Bad: The Parq Bar menu is extremely poor. The hotel charges 6 delivery fees for room service! There is no open buffet option for breakfast. The breakfast area is understaffed, and the 1 or 2 waiters/waitresses there are slow and inefficient. Good: The location of the hotel is amazing. The Parq Bar atmosphere at night is very nice. The concierge service in the hotel is very efficient."
"4419",2,"The room was very small, to have a full and queen size bed in it. And I clean home for a living and the bath room needs really down to using a tooth brush around the tub and floor, and I took the empty toilet paper roll out to put in the new one and the dirt I saw behind that empty roll was bad I left it out so the house keeper would see the dirt and what ever else was in there. And another chair in the room would be nice, a person can only set on the bed for just a little while then the back hurts."
"4420",3,"This hotel in the town center had a nice looking bar with uninterested lady bartenders. It is ok for a beer but not expert real hospitality. This can be done better. Marriott quality had a higher standard. This bar does not level the compagnies standard."

"4480",4,"Although my hotel rooms was great and the location was great there were a few things that will cause me not to return. The PARKING which they charged me 16 a day was horrible. The spots are so small that compact cars barely fit much less an intermediate or an ever so popular SUVs. Everyone went over the line making it impossible to find a spot and if you were lucky enough to find a spot and get into it, you couldn't get out of your car, most of the time it took me 15-30 minutes to park just because of the lot. The other thing I didn't like was no help with bags. They provided you with carts, but then there were stairs you had put your things in a dummy elevator and send them up or down and being an older person the maneuvering of the cart itself was cumbersome."
"4481",4,"Good location, near lot of general shopping and restaurants. The in hotel restaurant is excellent, highly recommended. The staff was very professional and helpful. Will stay here again when in the area."

"4484",3,"Stayed here to catch NYC at Christmas and were excited to stay in a legendary hotel. We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay. Dear NOIDK, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted. Our management team may be reached at GeneralManagerNYStRegis.com, and we would then be able to arrange a time at your convenience to speak.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"

"4490",4,"it was nice and clean, though room set up was inconvinent.Breakfast was good.Good deal.Will stay again."
"4491",4,"Staff were very friendly in general. Breakfast had a good selection. Rooms were kept clean and towels provided daily. We noticed a lot of school parties stay here and that some people hung out in the hallways which generated some noise. We were not impressed that 2 nights in a row we had to evacuate at around midnight taking our sleeping son out of his crib/cot. Lounge was not open through the week only on a Friday and Saturday - depending where you stay in hotel you may hear some noise. We arrived on a Friday night and there was a function on we had to park far away but there is plenty of parking available. Our room had a Refrigerator, microwave, Iron plus board. There was a slight concern for us as we were told that there may be no cribs left but thankfully we did get one. We were disappointed that the swimming pool was only open 6pm-10pm Mon-Fri and on Saturday and Sunday's it was 2pm-10pm. There is a small shop in foyer where you can buy essentials and various other items and there is also a computer and printer in this area too."

"4495",4,"Went on May 2015. Rest of the DC hotels were either sold out or very expensive. Overall it was ok. Rooms were fairly clean, breakfast wasn't that good (always out of something), staff was helpful, check in/out was quick and painless. Free parking is a plus. Depending on the day/time its about 30-45 min to downtown DC by car. They also offer shuttle service to nearest train station till 10pm everyday. I'd pick a closer hotel to downtown, but like I said there wasn't anything below 300, 84 was a steal :)"

"4497",5,"Our utility company needed to make upgrades to the sytem in our neighborhood and therefore, had to cut power for the day. We decided on a staycation, as the hotel was only 15 miles from our home. I'm glad we made the decision. The accomodations were large, comfortable and clean. We appreciated the manager's reception and our daughter loved the pool. As for room service- the quality was there and the gentleman who brought our food was kind and courteous. We plan to stay again soon."

"4500",3,"We were pleased with our stay, for the most part. The carpeting in the hallway seemed kinda dirty, but our room was clean. I didn't like that breakfast was only until 9 am. And the breakfast hostess, who was very nice, started taking it all down at 8:50. She did tell someone if they wanted yogurt, she would go in the back and get it. But I felt like I had to rush through breakfast."
"4501",4,"The Aloft came as advertised. It was more modern than the pictures on their website might lead you to believe. Green option was good, they do not refresh unless you ask them to. Nice bar with pretty good food in the hotel. 15 minutes or so to walk to the river and French Quarter. Staff were friendly and accomodating.Yay! We love when we exceed your expectations and thank you for letting us know. Appreciate the kind words and we look forward to seeing you back at Aloft New Orleans Downtown."

"4503",3,"I just got back from my 4 night stay here at the SunCoast hotel. I have to say that rooms are spacious, nice and very clean. Valet staff was also nice and was understanding when I forgot a couple items and the gentlemen who helped us carry our bags was very kind and welcoming as well. On the other hand, costumer service is very bad.Front desk staff is horrible. At some point, there was three families in line and all three of the front desk agents were looking at their computer screens completely ignoring that they had guests waiting to check in and check out for about 5 minutes (didn't even look up once). One afternoon I tried to order room service at around 2:40 and to my surprise the lady on the phone advised me that there wasn't anyone to take my order at the moment. So If i wanted to eat I had to go downstairs to the restaurant. At the restaurant, the staff was welcoming. They seated us quickly. But their attention to detail was missing. I had asked for a drink with ice and they would forget the ice. I order a plate a fruit which they completely forgot and tried to charge me for it. Thankfully I remember and got the charge voided. At the check out, a lady with white hair helped me and when I asked her for a bill she replied in a rude tone, Yeah! That's what I'm doing. Might not sound like a bad response but it's the way the person says it that has a bad effect. When I first arrived I immediately thought this was a beautiful hotel. Which it is, but I do believe the staff needs to have some costumer service orientations. (Or perhaps consider hiring younger more friendly people). Hello Angy F,Thank you for your recent visit and for leaving such thorough feedback! At Suncoast, we view all criticism as constructive and rely on it to provide better service and entertainment for our guests. Our team members strive to be friendly and personable during every interaction and are taught that service should always be prompt and accurate. It is disappointing to learn that we were unsuccessful in meeting these high standards during your time with us and I am sorry that it caused you to have less than a five star visit. Your comments will be forwarded to the appropriate management so that they can address and resolve the issues you have reported. Again, I apologize that you were not able to enjoy the high quality service Suncoast has become known for but urge you to visit in the future to experience the improvements caused by your comments."

"4560",5,"Staff is friendly, Hotel is Clean and very comfortable. They offer breakfast and chocolate chip cookies! What more do you need. This place has a fitness center and a pool. I stay here for business and I never choose another hotel. Would Highly Recommend."
"4561",3,"We stayed 2 nights at the Sanibel Inn. We had a 1st floor Gulf view room in the Periwinkle building. While the room location and view were just what we wanted, we had a hard time getting past the musty odor in the room. It may be that rooms on a beach will suffer from some dampness, but this seemed... More"
"4562",3,"We had a good stay in this hotel, it was clean and comfortable, everything was ok as far as the basic services, but the wireless internet did not work well at all during our 6 day stay. I would not recommend this hotel if you want reliable wireless internet access, I noticed that other guests had similar issues with the wireless access."
"4563",5,"From check in through check out, EVERYTHING about this hotel was amazing!! The facilities and rooms were better than the internet pictures...... The staff was very helpful and did what ever it took to make us happy and the price was very favorable!! If I ever need a hotel again, anywhere near Harrisburg... I will definitely be staying here."
"4564",5,"For the location, right outside of Savannah, the price can't be beat. The staff is very polite and accommodating, the motel is always busy with travelers, so you can assume it's a decent place to stay. The breakfast the following morning is better than most, they actually have pretty decent food. I enjoy staying here, and will come back"
"4565",4,"Stayed here due to its proximity to Metrolink and WUSTL. It worked out perfectly for my wife and I. We were able to park our 16 ft rental truck and travel further into St. Louis via the Metrolink. Besides its useful location, the Residence Inn is great because: 1. The rooms are huge. 2. Not only are they huge, but... More"
"4566",3,"During my recent stay at the Hilton I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the room. However, the staff made the correction and re-cleaned the room. I had a great stay, the food was great and the restaurant staff was wonderful. Overall the stay was nice and the hotel was quiet."
"4567",5,"I have stayed many times over the past several years at this classic hotel. The service from the front desk to the room attendants to the bartenders are top notch. The rooms have very comfortable beds with modern flat screen TV's. The pool is rooftop and has great views of the city. I highly recommend requesting a room on the... More"
"4568",5,"The hotel was suggested by family members that we visited in Columbus. we agree that the comfort and value were well worth the selection for our stay. if we should schedule a longer stay, such as a vacation we would surley have no problem requesting to stay at a Microtel again."
"4569",4,"I stayed at this hotel in February as part of a business trip. Overall, I found this hotel to be quite good for a Hilton Garden Inn. It's a large-sized hotel, and recently built so the rooms and common areas are in great shape. The hotel staff is very friendly, and while breakfast is an additional cost, I found the... More"
"4570",5,"Excellent customer service and the rooms are exceptionally clean. Would not think about staying anywhere else. The free breakfast every morning is great with a variety of options. Quick drive to the Redmond Airport and the shuttle service is very helpful."
"4571",4,"Although my stay was just a quick overnight, I was impressed by the looks and convenient location of this hotel."
"4572",5,"Stayed 1 night. Room was very clean, very quiet, staff very friendly. A+. Location was good. Felt safe. Breakfast very good and efficient. Pool and hot tub very nice often long drive. Keep up the good work. Will be back. View of Goodyear factory after restoration was awesome. American historic buildings are so cool when refurbished and reutilized."
"4573",5,"All of the usual accolades to a good hotel apply here. But I was particularly impressed by the employees' response when my 15-year-old granddaughter decided to socialize with some boys she met at the pool and didn't bother to tell me where she was going. The hotel's front desk and security people were extremely efficient and courteous in locating her, saving her 70-year-old grandfather much angst! And the service people in the restaurant area also went out of their way to get to know us."
"4574",2,"the rooms ac was leaking causing the floor to be wet around the window and ac. the hair dryer and phone didnt work. the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night. the sheets had crumbs and sparkles on them. Maintenance fixed the problems but its ridiculous they dont inspect their products."
"4575",4,"Our stay was short but convenient for what we had planned. The price was great. My only negative would be that I was not allowed to accumulate Wyndham points, because I used a booking agent."
"4576",4,"I wanted to stay overnight for the Air Show there were 600,000 people in AC, so I knew we would have to pay top dollar to stay anywhere. All the Casinos were booked and all the board walk properties were also booked with the exception of the 2 star Days Inn which wanted 280 per night. I decided to go for the best western 129 even though I had read some questionable reviews. We were suprised at how nice the hotel looked. It was clean nice tiled bathroom new looking carpet on hall floors and in the room. The AC in our room worked fine and was on when we got there. There was a nice sized frige, coffee machine and blow dryer. The halls were warm because windows were open (no AC on). We had a great complimentary breakfast in the morning including fresh make your own belgium waffels, bagles, pastries, muffins juices and coffee. Staff was friendly and helpful. Being a city girl I was definately on my guard walking the one long block from the boardwalk at night 1AM but it was well lit and had several clubs and resturants along the way. It is also centrally located to all the Casinos and the beach has a boardwalk entryway with a rinse off shower and public bathrooms."
"4577",4,"The hotel was surprisingly good. Our room was very clean and spacious for 2 people. The bed was extremely comfortable. I especially liked the pillows that they provided. It gave just the right amount of support to my neck to relieve the stress and fatigue after roaming in scorching Washington DC heat on 4th July weekend (100 F). Hotel staff was super helpful. As soon as we checked into our room, within half an hour hotel attendant provided couple of extra towels without requesting. I especially liked this nice gesture because anyone tired of traveling in hot weather will take a nice bath and would need extra towels for early morning next day. Breakfast was average in terms of variety and quality. Neighborhood is definitely not good. There are couple of police cars always in the Hotel campus. So walking to Metro station is out of question. I wish the free hotel shuttle frequency to metro station was like every 10 mins instead of half an hour. It hardly takes 2 mins by shuttle to reach the metro station. But if you miss it (we did miss by couple of mins, while waiting for the elevator to arrive), you have to wait half an hour for next shuttle. All in all it was nice experience. I would definitely stay again."
"4578",4,"Bad: Nothing!. Good: The hotel staff were very nice. The location of the Hotel is perfect. Its right at the beach and you even get a couple chairs and an umbrella."
"4579",5,"Best service all round For the price you pay the rooms are clean and spacious. Facilities could be improved within apartments but nothing that was un comfortable. The receptionist were helpful and friendly. Would recommend to anyone"
"4580",5,"We had a wonderful time! The breakfast buffet was delicious and lots of variety! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Only downside was the elevator was broke for 2 days of our stay but glad we were only on the 4th floor. The free shuttle to the metro was awesome and saved us so much in parking and the hassle of DC traffic. The room was clean and housekeeping provided our needs in necessities."

After calling BW customer service they suggest I call the hotel directly because there was nothing they could do. I called and... More"
"4583",5,"Bad: Parking was very pricey. No discount for staying at the hotel. Walking too far away at night is very uncomfortable but during day it is great fun.. Good: Bed was high -had to climb up- but very comfortable with great fluffy pillows and linens! Japanese toilet seats! Able to adjust room climate. Convenient to Japanese stores and museum. Great area restaurants. Nice caf shop on the ground floor."
"4584",5,"My daughter and I stayed overnight here before her cosmetology state board test.

"4585",5,"The hotel was nicer than I thought .Also a good location to the area I was visiting on my trip.Enjoyed their continental breakfast ,they had lot of variety of foods ."
"4586",3,"Basic room. Staff was nice and helpful. No lock on bathroom door. No hair dryer. Mini fridge in room clicked loudly and had to unplug to sleep. Denny's in parking lot which I originally counted as a plus attracted people leaving clubs at 2 am making the parking lot very noisy on Saturday night. AC worked well."
"4587",5,"I was beside the steps and people was up and down those stairs all night and early in the morning. I really didn't get my proper rest that I needed. And they were so loud."
"4588",5,"Bad: Everything was so good!! None!. Good: Everything! Oh my! What a view! Staff was wonderful, Bed pillow soft!! Food delicious! Access to so much! Perfect stay!! Next time I plan on coming with my husband so he can experience this wonderful place! He is a big Cub fan! He will love the Westin Inn North Chicago too!"

"4592",5,"Overall great stay, staf is very nice and helpful! Shuttle bus on time and 24/7 so very convienient. Also the breakfast at 6 and if you need to go before that, they give you a breakfast baggie to go, very thoughtful! Close to the airport and to Jersey Gardens Mall! I would recommend this hotel and come back here for sure."
"4593",2,"1. I did not like the experience of dealing with the Expedia person who assisted with the reservation. 2. It was annoying to learn only while checking out that this is a time share hotel. No one told me. 3. The WIFI was slow, and unreliable, cutting out from time to time. Also, when it tried to upgrade to the offered higher speed WIFI, it was quite an ordeal that took about 90 minutes and a call to the help line at your WIFI vendor. BTW, you might try the user interface for that sign up - it exasperatingly erases all one's data entries if a single one of them is incorrect (eg if you generate an unacceptable password) 4. The Business Center has two PCs that are excruciatingly slow, and a printer as well that lumbers along. Old, slow, out of date. 5. The single bright light in this business experience is that the staff were unfailingly polite and did their best to help. I give them credit for trying, and for being nice to me."
"4594",5,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It is in an excellent location - waterfront- right near the downtown Dunedin action. I would recommend staying here. The hotel has a bar and restaurant, waterfront view, great parking, great views"
"4595",4,"It was a nice clean hotel, they give a free shuttle to the metro station. But on weekends the parking in the metro station is free so you can very well drive ur own car and park there. Breakfast was good too."
"4596",4,"My sons basketball team participated in a tournament in Westminster and our organization reserved 30 rooms. The hotel did a great job of keeping us close together and the staff was great.

"4598",4,"Stayed at the Courtyard Lake Union for one night on business and I usually dread staying at Courtyards but was pleasantly surprised how well appointed this property was. I believe it has been significantly renovated and they've done a great job!The location is excellent with a lovely view of the lake and walking distance to many restaurants, bars and sights. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the space needle and about 60 minutes to Pike's Place.However, I've only given this hotel a 4 rating as 430 for one night is crazy for this level of accommodation.Hello kmalho,Thank you for taking your time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel. Our hotel did go through quite a few renovations and I am pleased to hear that you liked it. We hope to have another opportunity serve you whenever your travels bring you back to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative"
"4599",3,"The housekeepers were so loud that when taking a nap with my do not disturb sign out, they were yelling outside often door so loudly that I heard them over the hum of the heater and tv on low that I had on to ironically drown out noise. When I called to complain that the housekeepers were yelling Down the hall at each other, the staff just laughed and said sorry. Also- upon check out- there were there cop cars at the hotel and one cop at the front desk discussing an incident. Didn't make me feel safe."
"4600",5,"I really like this hotel. The staff is friendly helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. It is quiet and allows for a great nights sleep. For the price you can't beat it. As a female on business alone I felt safe in this hotel. The lobby is bright and always staffed."

"4603",4,"Lots of construction if your not paying attention you will miss your exit. The hotel doesn't look like much on the outside but it has been renovated. Quiet, comfortable stay"
"4604",5,"Bad: Noisy AC unit exhaust fan in bathroom did not exhaust, Great breakfast but no Waffle maker. Good: Staff very attentive and friendly, great service, nice and clean."
"4605",5,"The staff is outstanding, and they helped us with directions and where to go for awesome food, etc. Rooms are large and clean. Pool is very nice, and it's located just close enough to the French Quarter to have fun but also sleep in a nice, quiet hotel when you've had enough fun! Loved this place!!"
"4606",3,"Hotel is undergoing renovation and lots is construction personnel inside the hotel. The carpet in the hallway was very tired from all of the foot and wheel barrow traffic. Im sure hoping that it will be replaced as part of the renovation. My stay was satisfactory, but couldve been nicer without all the work going on."
"4607",1,"I am 71, have been travelling around the world all my life, and your hotel is the worst experience ever.My room has been booked through Booking.com for one month.I arrived Friday Sep 9th at 2.45 pm. I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table."
"4608",4,"I agree with other reviewers that the staff was very helpful and friendly. Krystal was particularly attentive during the evening reception when it came to food, beverages and finding the playoff baseball game on TV. I also liked the breakfast selection, especially the pre-made biscuit sandwiches. The hotel appears to be a remodeled apartment complex. I had the 2-bedroom loft... More"
"4609",5,"Upon arrival, we were welcomed courteously. The receptionist gave us a corner room with a convertible sofa bed. The extra space gave us plenty of room to place all the things needed for the wedding. The daily breakfast which were delicious was very convenient to start our daily activities. The housekeeping staff were very accommodating and courteous and helpful. The security staff were always present near the front door and very welcoming"
"4610",5,"This hotel was a bit older but very well maintained. The room was spacious with a separate full kitchen and a walk-in closet. There was zero noise from elevators or guests above or next door, unlike many newer hotels we've stayed in. Our only complaint was that the place was a bit difficult to find after dark - the sign is not high enough to be easily visible. In daylight, we discovered it was extremely easy to travel right next door to the Arlington Cemetary or across the Arlington Bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, etc. The price was very reasonable and we would definitely stay here again."
"4611",4,"Great hotel all around. Friendly service, very clean and quiet with a convenient location. Highly recommend!"
"4612",5,"Nice hotel very friendly staff. Breakfast is pretty much standard. The only thing I would recommend is a bench in the front of the hotel. It has an indoor pool but we didn't take advantage of that. Flying J truck stop is right across the street it can get noisy on the west side at times."
"4613",3,"Bad: The room was run down and would require to be renewed. Breakfast is very basic. There is no lift in the hotel. Good: Location is good. Room was spacious and had a comfortable bed."

"4619",1,"The hotel is poorly maintained, common areas like elevators were unkept, the breakfast was poor and in a bad location, and there was an infestation of bedbugs. The manager refused to talk to us even after two calls."
"4620",5,"We stayed for two nights in room 323 and had a very pleasant stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel because it's clean the staff is very pleasant and the breakfast is great. If ever in the area again I would definitely stay here."
"4621",3,"Stayed for one night on a business trip. It was worth 60 a night with tax on a Friday, Very minimum small room. Looks renovated but the bathroom needs a lot of work! No wifi even though the front desk gave me a password it don't even work! The area is pretty sketchy not the best around!!! Summer is probably a little better. Breakfast was just coffee and one muffin.... Everything is small here I suggest to stay at a casino hotel next time."
"4622",2,"Bad: The hotel did not have a fresh, clean smell and the appearance was not appealing."
"4623",5,"Good: Location"
"4624",3,"Im not sure if Ill be other reviewers are used to sleeping in tents, because I dont understand why it would be so great about this place. It has a feeling of age about it, like it was built 30 years ago and trying to look modern but failing.While Ive stayed in the worse hotel rooms, theres certainly nothing distinctive for attractive about this place. Frankly, my wife and I were thinking that we wouldve been better off just trying to sleep at the airport terminal then spend the night here.Thank you for taking the time to provide us feedback about your stay! I am sorry that you were not impressed with our facilities. We just had our exterior renovated in April 2018 and we look forward to getting an interior refresh soon. We like to think that so many of our guests give us great reviews because of our exemplary service. If your travels ever bring you to Atlanta again, we would love to have you back as our guest.Warm Regards,Justina H.General Manager"

"4634",5,"Great service and food. No complaints they were very hospitable. When I travel I try to stay at the Hampton inn if there's one near by. Price is afordable and you can't beat the breakfast in the morning. There is a huge variety of food and on Sunday's they serve an even greater variety."

See you again soon, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"4643",4,"Pulled in late. No prob getting a room that allowed our small dog. Room was non-smoking, fresh, and clean! Got a hot shower and good nights sleep. Don't know how the free breakfast was, walked next door to Denny's instead. Would definitely stay here again."

"4653",3,"The stay was adequate but the hotel was dark inside. First thing that hit us when entering the room was a strong odor of some sort of freshener. When going over the essentials, it did not have any toothpaste. Although the staff is very nice, we requested toothpaste 4 times within 3 hours before it was finally delivered. Still, the stay was adequate for the price we paid in this area."

Not enough seating, not enough staff, and most importantly not enough food. Today is our third breakfast here and they have run out of food each day. Today they are out of milk and waiting for a delivery. We bought milk from the hotel store to put on cereal and then realized it was expired. Guests are lined up six or 7 deep waiting for the breakfast sandwiches to be replenished. As we sit here now, it has been 30 minutes and there is still no milk. That said, the room itself has been very pleasant. Just don't plan on eating breakfast here."

"4660",1,"First we booked the hotel using hotels.com it had 2 stars which was fine since we just needed a quick place to sleep so we could go back to universal studios in the morning. We were not expecting much but what we got was so much worse. When we went to check in we had to give them an extra... More"
"4661",5,"We recently spent two nights at the Inn of the Vines Best Western Plus. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well appointed. The staff was extremely helpful and welcoming. We had reservations for the Wine Train and the hotel location was ideal- only about 1 1/2 miles away."
"4662",4,"I drove 9 hours from NC and happened to arrive eight hours before check in time . However I called the hotel and they let me check in hours earlier than I was scheduled to. Great customer service . Will be staying here again! The free breakfast is pretty great too!"
"4663",5,"We recently traveled to Northern Vermont for the first time. On the recommendation of a friend, we stayed at the Grey Gables Mansion. Tim and Debbie were fantastic hosts.

"4664",5,"Good: Monte made my eggs to perfection, just the way I asked."
"4665",5,"Bad: Nothing. Good: Location, size of room, cocktail lounge from 5 pm to 8 pm, size of bathroom"
"4666",5,"Staff was friendly, service was very good, hotel very convenient to restaurant and other stores, great freeway access, suite was very spacious, only issue their equipment in breakfast was not working at times."
"4667",2,"My husband and I stayed at the Best Western Plus Arroyo Roble Hotel on Thursday, Feb. 18, 2016, the room was very expensive but we splurged as this was our first time in Sedona. We were given Room 405 which has a beautiful view of the red rock. The problem is that the elevator is right across from the room,... More"
"4668",3,"Bad: I didnt like being charged daily fees for the beach/pool when I never used them. Good: I was incorrectly being charged for the previous guests breakfast, its a good thing I checked my bill. I liked that the complaint was immediately checked and the bill promptly rectified."
"4669",3,"I stayed in a room near the vending area but it was pleasantly quieter than I would have expected. Also Major renovations occurring on all floors so it was dusty but no noise was heard at night."
"4670",5,"Had a wonderful stay here. My fiancee and I came for a weekend getaway. The staff was really helpful, the hotel is immaculate, the spa is a blast, and in the best part of Portland. We will definitely be back."
"4671",3,"Location is awesome and walking distance from a lot of great bars, restaurants and a mall. Besides that the quality of the hotel didn't really live up its price-level. Staff was friendly but poorly trained. Just little things like an employee hijacking an elevator down to parking as I was trying to go up and another one at the front... More"

"4673",4,"As a frequent traveler, I have come to view the Hampton Inns as the best value for comfort when away from home. They are uniformly situated, making each nights stay as familiar as my own home. The breakfasts are always good.

"4674",5,"Worked out perfect for our sightseeing in DC."
"4675",5,"Very convenient location. Hotel very convenient for traveling in New York City. Recently renovated, very comfortable and clean beds, modern furnishings (LCD TVs), granite counter tops in bathrooms. Good price too! Taking the bus from New York City to the hotel takes only 15 minutes. The commute in can be a little longer, up to an hour, so leave lots of extra time traveling into NYC. The Wal-Mart next to the hotel was very convenient for last minute things. Would return next time I go to NYC. The hotel restaurant never seemed to be busy though, even at night."
"4676",3,"nice quiet comfortable room"
"4677",2,"This was my second stay with a Ramada branded hotel. I had such high hopes for our stay since the previous Ramada we stayed with was such a good experience, unfortunately I cannot say the same for this stay.

"4678",5,"We are Choice Hotel platinum members, and we've discovered that many of the Comfort Suite properties are comparable in price to the original hotel rooms, but larger and with more amenities. This one is definitely in that category, and we did not find a problem with cleanliness like a few others did.. Like other reviewers we had trouble finding it... More"
"4679",4,"Bad: The room lacked a traditional desk and desk chair. This made it uncomfortable to use a computer. Good: Breakfast served on each floor"
"4680",4,"Bad: Construction at hotel, but obviously it has to be done at sometime or another. Realize that was just just bad luck on out part. Thought the price for the hotel was a little high. Good: Nice staff, Luisa from Potugal could have not been nicer."
"4681",2,"The grout in the bathroom was filthy,  the rooms are out dated.  The noise we got being on the 39th floor must have been from poor insulated glass.  We could hear the cars driving.  The bed wall was aginst the two elevators running up and down all night.  The breeze way running to the vehicle garage was being used as the smoking area buy the staff.  It was suffocating coming in and out of the building.  The only time we ate there was first day in the morning.   The buffet was horrible.  The bacon was rock hard,  the powdered eggs tasted like caulk, the ham was nothing but grease.  Very unhappy with the meal.  And to top it off it cost $35.00 for two of us.  I had continental breakfast that had more to offer, and alot better taste. Adding the 34.00 for car parking,  the horrible breakfast,  and two nights of restless sleep.   It cost me 700.00.  This is a very unsatisfied customer that will post to other trends to let people know that this is hotel shouldn't even have a rating."
"4682",4,"My family had a very nice stay. super location everything right out the door. Breakfast could not be better and free.very friendly staff all and all a great place to stay."
"4683",5,"Very Nice Hotel very clean. was very close to event. Had good breakfast served in the morning. Was close to shopping for the wife. Lots of restaurant close to Hotel. Easy excess to Highway. Was impressed with the Beds."
"4684",2,"Room smelled musty. No elevator, and very second rate breakfast. Definitely not worth the price."
"4685",4,"Bad: the hotel was just ok the employees were friendly and helpful but the area is a little rough, had to walk 4 or 5 blocks before you found anything going on other than other hotels. The area outside of the hotel is dirty up and down the streets."
"4686",4,"There was a slim guy at the front desk who was very friendly and very helpful (e.g.- wrote out instructions to the Metro station). The women were efficient, but not nearly as friendly. The rooms were clean. We also liked the front lounge area. Pool needed some work and the exercise room could use towels (the towels would help to reduce the smell of sweat in the room)."
"4687",4,"Older hotel needs updating past the front entrance. Rooms were big, but needed updating ."
"4688",5,"Efficient, friendly staff helps make every aspect -- check in, stay, check out -- easy and pleasant. On a long trip that really hits the spot. The room and amenities range from very good to excellent for this type of property."
"4689",5,"We had a quick one night stay in Atlanta for business meetings. This hotel was great in terms of being quiet, short shuttle drive from Airport.

"4690",5,"I enjoyed the convenience of the location and having the Whole Foods store within walking distance was a plus."
"4691",5,"We were thoroughly satisfied with our stay at Holiday Inn Express.  For a budget hotel, the surroundings were clean, freshly painted, and we commented that the bedding was the most comfortable of any we'd slept in.  We would definitely recommend this hotel."
"4692",2,"Not going here again. No coffee dirty place and bad neighborhood"
"4693",2,"Bad: the value of the motel is not much with what you charged us."
"4694",5,"My husband and I just completed a stay here and really loved it. The staff could not be more accommodating. Kitchens are really kitchens equipped a working oven. We barbequed steaks on the outside grill by the pool. However, do this before the sun goes down. There isn't much light in that area after dark. We did have small red ants upon arrival and they moved us to another, more expensive room without charge. Fantastic staff. This is really the only place to stay."
"4695",4,"This was a business trip and I found the hotel occupied by business people as well as families. Staff was very friendly and accommodating, on all shifts. Bed was comfortable. My room was taken care of nicely except for one day when the bed was not made (I didn't mention it to the desk clerk). Breakfast was set up late every day (after 7 a.m. although the sign says 7:00 and I was told it is actually 6 to 6:30 and all the hot items required microwaving, so early birds can't really eat and run. It was impossible to control the heat, cool and humidity in the room but I understand a renovation is scheduled so I imagine that will correct that situation. Price was right. Overall, I would stay in this property again."
"4696",5,"Very nice hotel in a good location. Staff was pleasant and welcoming. I was Hilton's guest of the day which was a pleasant surprise! I love Hampton Inns and find them to be a great value. Breakfast is an additional bonus."

"4700",5,"Our stay was fantastic, our room had a wonderful view of downtown Atlanta! Everyone was very hospitable, room was clean and comfortable. A special thanks to Mr. Gary Thomas for making sure the our stay was fantastic until the minute we pulled away from the hotel parking."
"4701",4,"VERY clean, comfortable place to stay located near downtown Napa. The grounds are nothing special, but there is a (very) small pool and jacuzzi, as well as a small fitness center. Clean, comfortable and conveniently located. If you plan to mostly be out and about in Napa, stay here. If you plan to spend your time lounging around the pool and grounds, pick someplace else. But you'll probably have to pay more.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay."
"4702",2,"Room musty and not well ventilated. No hot water in show despite multiple trips to the front desk to ask for assistance or another room. Front desk staff asked if I turned the knob the opposite way Hotel staff made no effort to move us to another room or fix the problem. Will not be staying here again."
"4703",5,"Great staff and very friendly. Room was very clean, comfortable beds, and very good continental breakfasts delivered to our rooms. We will recommend and would definitely return on a future trip. Amenities in the room were very nice."
"4704",5,"We came to visit my stepmother to celebrate her 92nd birthday. Nice, clean and quiet.Unfortunately she had been sent to a hospital out of town. The room was clean and the staff was smiling and very professional.Breakfast was good. Loved having my own coffee pot. Plenty of plugs for charging devices."
"4705",4,"Older hotel that is in the middle of a commercial business park, stayed for a few days, room was clean and well furnished, walls are a little thin, but that's what you get with an older place. good coffee shop in the lobby, walking distance to Karl Strauss Brew Pub, would stay again."
"4706",4,"I enjoyed my 3-night stay here. I was given a nice room the continental breakfast was first rate. There was some trouble with one of the elevators, and the room was overly perfumed, but the staff were friendly and helpful."
"4707",3,"We had stayed at the Ka'anapali Alii (which was fantastic but much more expensive) on our first trip and looked forward to this trip back to Kaanipali. Although this resort is beautiful, it is off the beaten path with not as much to do. I guess you could walk to Whaler's Village, but it's a long walk. Duke's is great,... More"
"4708",1,"Location not too bad. Close to lots of restaurant. There were blood on the sheets, I informed the front desk and they didn't even come to change it."
"4709",1,"There was a small black bug in my room by the bed. Manager-I don't know what kind of bug it is threw it in the trash. He shrugged his shoulders and said, there really isn't anything I can do for you."
"4710",4,"Great place to stay with the kids! It has a nice pool, an indoor play area, and an arcade. The breakfast is what you would expect from other hotels not overly fancy. The hotel itself is a little run down but not particularly dirty. Most of the staff is very helpful. We booked two rooms and were upgraded to two huge three bed suites with two bathrooms so there was plenty of room for my family of five. We would stay again."
"4711",5,"Fabulous room. great beds in 2 bedroom suite, I want to thank all of the people who made my stay super.and spectacular. Staff exhibits a great deal of friendly atmosphere.

"4712",5,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in April, coming from Victoria on the Clipper. The hotel was very conveniently located, just four blocks from the ferry terminal. We were met by Lee, who was very courteous, and very helpful with suggestions and directions for sightseeing and restaurants. The room was very nice, and very quiet. We enjoyed happy hour in the lobby, and we had one dinner in the restaurant downstairs. The ambience is very retro. The front-desk and cleaning staff were wonderful. We could do all of the sightseeing we wanted on foot. Chihuly Garden and Glass was a highlight. Highly recommended.Dear Guest,Thank you for this fantastic review! Our location really is ideal for 'on-foot' sightseeing of the Chihuly Museum/Space Needle as well the Pike Place Market. Nice when we are perfectly placed in the middle of these two iconic spots! Your kudos for Lee are so appreciated as well. We pride ourselves on making guests feel as if they've traveled to a home away from home, so it would be our greatest honor to welcome you back as our guests again in the future. Please feel free to reach out to me directly when you consider your next trip to Seattle :)Best Regards,David Bayley"

"4717",4,"Now has new owners and managers and it is getting BETTER! Have stayed here a few years in a row, it is a nice little place accross from the beach and close to everything! It needs a little TLC, but I think the new manager will get things done! can't wait to come back next year!!"
"4718",5,"Bad: Breakfast was a little sparse but was as advertised. Good: Nice room, small but cozy."
"4719",5,"The staff welcomed us and took care of our every need. We are both handicapped and they did our best to meet our every need. We were very pleased with the Garden Inn and the staff. The room was very clean and all amenities were in place."

"4723",5,"We could not have had a better stay at the Mills House Hotel. Every detail was managed well. Because of our recent bookings at other hotels in this chain, we were automatically upgraded to their priority club. Great amenities came with the upgrade, which made our stay more enjoyable. The entire staff was friendly, courteous, and professional. The front desk and concierge made dinner suggestions and reservations for us both nights, with which we were very satisfied. We could not have stayed in a better hotel. We will stay there again if we return."
"4724",5,"The staff was very friendly and the hotel was spotless! Nice morning breakfast!"
"4725",5,"cant think of anything Location, helpful staff, quiet room, good beds, wifi and breakfast."
"4726",5,"This is the second time staying here with my wife. Just like before, it was a great time. the rooms have plenty of space, the are clean and comfy, and carry the Victorian era theme in them.

"4727",5,"Good: Loved the area. Very quiet."
"4728",3,"As other reviewers stated, the staff here is awesome. I've stayed in five-star resorts that didn't have this level of customer service. It's a shame they have to work in a facility that they have to make excuses for. The elevator was broken 95 of the time we were here. I had a bad knee and my 82 year old... More"
"4729",5,"I would definitely stay at the Aria again. The Aria needs to hire more more Check-in staff from 5PM - 7PM. We had to wait at least 15 minutes to check-in, I felt like I was at an Airport Ticket Counter"
"4730",4,"As a whole experience was good, would stay again, but in a room that was not so close to general hotel activities. staff friendly and pleasant. No bath mat and soap in bathroom doing second day of stay."
"4731",4,"The front desk person was extremely nice and helpful. He allowed us to change our room three times before we (my wife who's pregnant) settled on a room that was easy to walk to and from elevator, able to see vehicle from room window, and right side orientation. The free breakfast buffet was a BIG plus! The indoor pool and hot tub were clean and very nice to enjoy with visiting family for Christmas!"

"4734",4,"Room was a bit small, well furnished, very clean. Very quiet. Would stay again. Right on the Interstate but is very quiet. Breakfast is minimal but the area is very clean. I believe the shower door is installed backward as you have to get in the shower to turn it on and risk cold shower before the water warms up."
"4735",4,"Very helpful and friendly staff, overall a good stay with just a few hickups. Breakfast had a nice variety and overall good. The room was nice and clean except for a large bug that I disposed of. Location was on a dead end street that was odd to get too but OK once you had it figured out."
"4736",4,"Very nice hotel."
"4737",5,"good"
"4738",4,"Stayed here overnight to go to fedex field. Very close to metro and the hotel will take you to and pi k you up from the metro station. Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms nice and clean. All we needed or our two night stay. Area directly surrounding hotel a little hard to navigate and not a lot of choices. Couple of nice eateries within 5 min walk."
"4739",4,"Good: i enjoyed the design, decoration and layout of the room"
"4740",2,"This hotel was awful. It was so noisy you could hear EVERYTHING. Lots and lots and lots of kids running and screaming the entire night. Guess it might be good for a family but unless you have wild children it is not worth it. I heard every car outside. One of our pillows had dirt on it. We booked a king bed and got two queens. It smelled weird. It was dated. An elevator was out so it always took forever to go up or down. The parking was cramped and limited. Save your money and don't waste it on this place.I have stayed at nicer Motel 6's."
"4741",5,"We had reservations at another place but, we did not feel safe nor did it look clean. We had a last ditch effort to call Best Western Plus again to see if there were any vacancies (softball tournament in town). They had a vacancy!! From the moment we called the first time to the time we left, the staff was... More"
"4742",3,"Bad: Room was very small and not comftorable for two people. It felt like a third the size of a standard hotel room with just enough space to walk around the bed and a chair in the corner. Bathroom is super small. View from our main floor window was a sketchy back alley with construction. Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street! All in all I feel like this hotel is over priced, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Good: The location of the Charlesmark is great for tourists and people wanting to be in a good spot to transit around but feel safe and enjoy some night life"
"4743",4,"The staff was friendly and helpful. I love Hampton Inns. Every Hampton inn is the same. It is consistent. Unlike other chain hotels which may be franchised. You always know a Hampton will be comfortable and clean."
"4744",4,"This hotel has all the amenities we wanted. The bar is wonderful. The food in Vines, the restaurant, is exceptional. We have enjoyed the wait staff tremendously every time we dine there. The location of the hotel is in a very nice area with many restaurants. For families, it is close to Magic Mountain."
"4745",5,"Awesome pool, comfy beds, pillows. Great view of downtown, and easy to get to plaza or to crown center."
"4746",2,"It's pretty obvious the owner is letting this place run down while he collects exorbitant rates (weekends) for a room. My room was clean and very spacious. It also showed signs of lone term neglect. The included breakfast has to be the worst I have encountered - if all you want is a glass of orange juice they can handle... More"

Plenty of parking neibors were respectful and quiet. I loved this place the first time we were there and like itequally on our second stay at the motel"
"4750",5,"Bad: Rooftop bar is more style than substance, go to be seen, not to enjoy view or surroundings, and inconvenient to have to go downstairs to go back up. Perhaps a residents hour for hotel guests only, when lift can go directly up. Good: Great location, very stylish, helpful staff especially the doormen"
"4751",3,"Bad: I rely a lot on wifi at a hotel. The wifi was inconsistent."
"4752",5,"This is an upscale, modern hotel with the camaraderie of a hostel. The huge lobby has a giant fireplace, a billiards table, and a full bar, where guests were hanging out and socializing.

The sheets were crisp and clean, so relaxing after a long day of activities. The area was quiet and we had no safety issues. There is coffee in the lobby which was good. No other food or drink except vending machines, but numerous eating choices on the same street. There is no elevator, but we had a ground floor room, so this wasn't an issue for us. Overall a good value if you are just looking for a place to sleep. We would definitely stay there again."

We noticed two negatives in the room: the paint in bathroom was pealing badly and the tub did not drain well the first day. We reported the drain issue and they fixed it while we were away the next day. We had stayed at this hotel 3 years ago and we will likely stay here again in the future."

"4773",5,"Hotel is right off of the main highway into VA Beach, so it's very quick to get in and out. It is right by the boardwalk as well, within walking distance of the pier. So overall, I love the location! The room is small and divided into two section--living area (with pull out couch or another queen bed depending on room selection), and bedroom. I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus. Wife and kids loved the balcony facing the ocean, we enjoyed watching the beach at dusk. Overall, we had a very pleasant 3 nights stay at this Comfort Inn and will definitely book it for next year's trip back to VA Beach."

"4780",5,"Stayed here based on the reviews and can definitely see why it comes highly regarded. Well appointed rooms, great breakfast, and valet service was great! Solidly build old federal building so noise wasn't an issue and room was impeccably clean. It was a quick overnight stay but would definitely return if in the area!"

But if I am cold,... More"

"4790",4,"If you are looking for a place to have your wedding in Baltimore, this would be it. If you're looking to stay for the weekend, be aware that there is a chance there will be a lot of wedding activity, crowds and loud music. This might interrupt your stay."

"4792",5,"Great getaway"
"4793",5,"Check in was fantastic! The rooms were clean. They have a fantastic pool for kids, which was great since we have a two year old. It was close to most of the major attractions. They had a variety of breakfast items to choose from. We will definitely stay again!"
"4794",5,"We stayed here in July for half of our Maui stay. We have been to Maui several times and this was our favorite place we've stayed so far.

"4799",5,"Good: I loved having a microwave and fridge. Very cozy!"
"4800",5,"The hotel is at the best location, convenient for shopping, hiking, or simply relaxing. The breakfast (included) is incredibly good and generous. Free village parking and transportation are just a few steps away. Overall, a great deal."
"4801",2,"The place is run down and old the only thing it has going for it is the balcony off the room but even that isn't anything special. They say the bathrooms are updated!

"4802",5,"A little pricy, but it was 4th of July weekend so we totally understand. But the price was well worth it. Martha at the front desk was great! Excellent customer service from her! Always smiled and was so helpful. We loved this hotels location too. We will be back soon ."

"4804",5,"Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future"
"4805",5,"Needed to be close to family at a reasons price. Hyatt was perfect for that. I wish the bathroom was a little bit bigger. And I wish the fridge was a little bit colder. Other than those two things, my room was perfect. One elevator was out but it didn't make much difference. Rode the elevator alone most of the time. Didn't seem too crowded in there. There's always someone at the lobby desk with a smile. In the middle of the night, you wouldn't expect that but all the staff I met were super nice and accommodating. I'd stay here again for sure."
"4806",3,"The reason I choose this motel was it was the least expensive motel in the area with a total cost with all taxes and fees of about 70.00 a night. Though not expensive, it is a higher end price especially for a motel and for that you would expect to have a very decent to excellent motel room. That was... More"

"4808",5,"Both the evening and morning staff working the front desk were outstanding. They were busy with guest, breakfast, both cooking and serving, helping guest with requests even finding an empty room where I could dry my hair as the dryer in our room was not working all the while she was very busy with check outs and breakfast."
"4809",5,"Hotel was very clean. Wonderful accommodations.the staff were very friendly and helpful. They made sure everything was in order. We were in the city for a funeral and the staff and hotel made things easier for us. I would stay at this hotel again, and again."
"4810",3,"The staff were very friendly and helpful, but the hotel itself is a hit or miss. Upon arrival, the room was very small, crowded, outdated uncomfortable.

"4815",5,"We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT"
"4816",3,"Spacious rooms, a lovely bay view and a reasonable price, but there were enough weird things that I won't be back. I did also appreciate the warm indoor pool for my winter visit. Weird things: -The light switch just inside my door did nothing, so I had to cross the room in the dark to turn on a light. -Door to the deck didn't actually latch shut, but at least it had a lock chain like on front doors. -Room keys both stopped working...twice...and had to be reset. -Elevators sometimes reopened immediately after shutting for no reason, had to hit door close again. Or were summoned to the floor I was waiting on, then didn't open. Had to 'summon' the elevator again for the door to open."
"4817",5,"From the time we walked in and greeted by Frank we knew it was going to be an amazing place. Frank gave us some local tips and Ed escorted us to our beautiful room making sure we had everything we needed, bringing us extra water and suggesting places to eat. We were there for 2 amazing nights, shame we didn't take as much advantage as we could have being.located in the shopping plaza..... So so many shops. Courteous, friendly staff. Service impeccable, in fact we rushed in after a full day had a quick shower before meeting friends, returned and found fresh towels! Amazing"

"4822",3,"This place needs a serious reno to stay alive. I booked with Expedia, specifically asked for 3 people in one room. The hotel still charged me 5 bucks extra for that, when we arrived. I think the admin costs of doing that was more than what that 5 bucks covered. Not very smart. We arrived late, around 3:30 AM, and... More"
"4823",4,"Check-in went smoothly. Staff was very professional and helpful. The room smelled a bit stuffy and the air conditioner could have used a change in its filter. The room overall was clean tidy. The morning breakfast selection was okay. It offered the waffles and fruit, etc., I wished they had prepared the oatmeal instead of providing instant packets. Some of the fruit was very ripe and not as fresh as it could have been. Plenty of parking and close to the interstate."
"4824",4,"My fiance and I stayed here to go the Nationals games Friday and Saturday nights. The hotel is very close to the metro and made it easy to get to the ballpark and the zoo. The free champagne was a nice touch to start our trip. Only negative is that if you use the wifi and are not a Rita Carlton rewards member they charge you 9.95 per day. I asked about this charge and they promptly refunded it since we were only using it to check emails on our phones and could have used our data had we known it was that expensive. Otherwise a very nice hotel with excellent staff that make your experience enjoyable."

Toilet was stained. There was mold on the window drapes. Emergency exit would not shut or lock. Cigarette butts all over the ground out side of the room. Pool was not functional. Trash on room patios. There was a Bullet hole in a window."
"4828",3,"Everything was good. I only spent a short night. I had an early flight the next morning."
"4829",4,"Hotel was in reasonable conditio. We were upgraded to a junior suite. The room was nice, reasonable clean and confortable and located near a Metro Station. The neighborhood was questionable, though we had no problems, I wouldn't recommend going out at night. Breakfast was limited, but plenty of food."
"4830",5,"Great, clean place to stay. Needed to be near the airport. Breakfast was over priced. But I would still recommend this hotel. It was a little difficult to locate at night. Could use a street light and hotel sign at the corner. Almost ran over curb."

"4836",5,"I was visiting the area for business and picked this hotel for its proximity to my meetings. I had some flight issues flying into California, so had to call and change my reservation. When I called the hotel I spoke with Viri, who was super helpful and very friendly. She took care of everything and had a great sense of humor. When I checked in Viri happened to be working with a few others at the front desk. They were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The coffee in the lobby all day is a nice perk. I was unable to enjoy breakfast, but it looked nice as I grabbed an apple and ran out the door to meetings. I will definitely be staying at this location if I have any future business in the Anaheim area. Management should be proud of their friendly, helpful, and smiling staff."
"4837",3,"Bad: The website for hotel says happy hour food and a drink included. Nowhere on booking.com or Kinzie website does it mention that it's not included. So we were charged for it. I requested to have it removed and haven't heard back if they did so. But besides that, where the drinks/food is located is in a room with no windows/a dark cave. Not nice and not worth going to it. Sorry, nice thought but did not like. In this world of communication, it should be noted that there is a charge. Good: It was clean. Had good hair products. Bed and pillows were comfortable."
"4838",3,"I was on the ground floor. The slamming doors are horrible!! Woke me up all night, I am a very sound sleeper. Then the second night, there was a wedding. Talking, screaming, doors slamming all night until 4am. Then outside my window, people were gathering and also talking all night."

From our arrival we were greeted by Benny, the Bell Captain who along with the rest of his Bell staff took care of us from go. We were allowed to check in early to a Junior Suite 102 which had a beautiful view of the Ocean located at the end of the street. Our suite was located out in a building separate from the main hotel and off the pool area. Just around the corner from the front desk. Our suite was large had a separate sitting area with a flat screen TV and a small fridge under the counter which had plenty of cabinet space. 2 sinks one in the bathroom and one in the counter where the fridge was. Luxurious Bathrobes that I ABSOLUTELY wanted (will put on my birthday list :) Bellman Dan scooted us over to a local restaurant in the hotel golf cart... they will offer to take you just about anywhere and will also return to pick you up.rnrnService at the Front Desk was exceptional, friendly, courteous and consistently above and beyond helpful!

The day before the boyfriend ordered a Cloud 9 that was the BOMB! and I got my favorite Lemon Drop both were flavorful but I must say this was the only place I was not impressed with the Bar Service it took a while for our appetizers to arrive and they were not as attentive as the rest of the hotel staff had been /rnrnAll and all a very nice place to drop in during the week we get the impression that weekends here (like most places) are a zoo.

It tookthirty minutes before the server to bring water with no menus. Then when asked it took her another 15 minutes to retrieve those. After... More"
"4872",3,"Check in took several minutes because the hotel clerk was having trouble with the guest before us. Clerk was not especially welcoming. Room is clean and updated, but sparse. This room was adequate but we would not have stayed there except it is within walking distance to Disneyland."
"4873",5,"Room was a bit small but staff excellence and great location equaled an awesome stay."
"4874",4,"The hotel was nice. Beds were very comfy! Elevators wre fast. My only negative would be the smoke in the casino was pretty bad. And there was not a no smoking area which I found odd."

"4876",4,"Hotel staff unusually pleasant and accommodating. Night club loud and hopping, but could not hear a thing from my 4th floor room. Could hear the nearby interstate, though. Motorcycles. Toiletries did not include conditioner and none available in gift shop. Convenience store near by, but borrowed some from a fellow guest we met at the free breakfast. Breakfast was good. Very convenient to highway."
"4877",4,"Great for a short stay close to all"
"4878",5,"Right in the heart of Down town and close to everything you need. One of the best hotels in the city and the prices were pretty reasonable too.

"4879",5,"What a wonderful experience for a girls get away. Chef Dean and Nicole were great hosts. Breakfast was an international, yummy delight. Each room was different and very comfortable. The beds were conducive to a great night's sleep. We will be returning for our annual fall get away. Thanks so much Chef Dean an Nicole."
"4880",4,"This is a unique property in that they combined a Hilton Garden Inn with a Homewood Suites (Also by Hilton). They have separate lobbies, but all hallways are connected and they use the same elevators. Staff were very friendly, and helpful. Rooms were very clean, and in great shape (this is a newer facility). Our room on the top floor... More"
"4881",5,"Paying for parking, I thought parking was included. Breakfast was great, waffles, Western omelet, yogurts, fruits. Loved the coffee access."
"4882",4,"The room was clean, the amenities nice. Attached is one of the best diners I've ever eaten at, complete with an old-fashioned ice cream fountain that took me back to my youth. Portions were generous and the quality of the food excellent. The motel staff were nice and helpful when possible."
"4883",5,"the management and staff at this hotel go above and beyond... in town for a family emergency and the staff couldn't have been more understanding and cordial .. very professional while being very caring as well ... the property is well run and very clean as well"
"4884",2,"Best Western on Pacific Ave Atlantic City NJ was dirty, bad section of town, in fear of our families safety. Never again, I always stay at Best Westerns , never a problem, but stay away from this one."
"4885",5,"comfortable room. good air conditioning,Friday night stay in business park area, so very few guests. Price could have been under 100."
"4886",5,"I loved it but i think the parking is to high."
"4887",5,"Very clean. Breakfast was good and a variety each morning. Many different choices. We stayed for 5 nights. Staff friendly and helpful. Property was very well kept and pleasant. Would definitely stay again."
"4888",5,"Just traveling through and needed a place to sleep. We could not have found a better place. Wonderful staff, what was left. Due to Memorial Weekend they have the housekeeping staff off on that Monday! What a great gesture! Clean, comfortable bed, nice pool and connected to Perkins where received a complementary breakfast. The only negative was we could hear other guest talking when we were in the bathroom and other noises from our room. Easy on and off I 94. 10 day road trip and this was one of the best."
"4889",4,"I stayed in two seperate rooms at this hotel. The first was 209 upstairs over looking the shared balcony. It was small but clean and gorgeous, perfect for one person. My only complaint is the Windows don't open, as they've been painted over. Would be nice to get some fresh air, although this room has its own thermostat with air. The staff was amazing and watched my bags for me the entire next afternoon after check out, as I wasn't sure if I was gonna stay again or not. I decided to stay, and they offered me a similar rate to the first night even though prices went WAY up. The girls at the front desk are super awesome. The next room I stayed in was downstairs, definitely larger than the first, just as beautiful but different. The energy was different, it was dark, and I had a few issues with cell phone reception, not picking up the guest wifi and a broken TV that they couldn't do anything about. Overall I loved staying at this hotel. It felt special. It is special. Its a fantastic hotel to stay at if you want the NOLA French Quarter experience. On a personal note: this hotel is definitely haunted. I not only had the same dream both nights that were pretty spooky and gruesome, but I awoke the second morning to someone humming softly into my ear and a grab/scratch at the back of my neck. Let's just say my heart was POUNDING!"
"4890",4,"My room was a nice one. Clean and comfortable. I was here with a group - 20 rooms booked for 4 nights stay and the hotel staff could not have been more professional or accommodating. If we decide to make our event an annual one, we will definitely come back here."
"4891",4,"Bad: Very minimal breakfast. Good: Great location."

"4901",4,"The shuttle to the station wasn't always as available as implied, however it was quite an easy walk. If you have a UK mobile calling for the shuttle for a return trip from the station could be a problem but there were pay phones available. When we first went to our allocated room we were disappointed to have a brick wall just a few feet from the window. Upon request we were immediately moved to another room. The two minor problems we had with the room (safe and iron) were rectified quickly. In view of other comments we found the breakfast to be really disappointing and eventually decided to eat elsewhere. A car for a week is cheaper than a taxi to and from Dulles airport."

"4905",4,"Great hotel for price. Large rooms with good views. We had small toddler and he had room to play and climb--very spacious! Room was very clean and hotel staff was great. Nice breakfast (eggs, waffles, French toast, fruit, yogurt). Everything was great, but the pool. Pool was extremely small and was greenish in color. I was surprised at how small it was. Other than that, great hotel for the money and it is close to the inner harbor and National Aquarium. Don't valet, as they charge 42 per day. Garage behind hotel was 3 on the weekend and we parked there 20+ hours. During week it was only 14 to park overnight."
"4906",5,"From the time I entered the hotel to the time I left it was a great experience. Had a wonderful room with lots of space and a great view to the city. The food was really good. And not to mention its Vegas, their casinos are open round the clock."

"4917",3,"The Holiday Inn Express is on the north side of town in an area with other hotels, some restaurants and some box stores. The receptionist was friendly, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Rooms have fridges, irons and TVs with a good selection of channels. Breakfast is included in the price. The bedroom was attractively furnished. The bathroom was a bit dowdy. But the hotel did what was needed - provide a safe and comfortable place to spend the night while on the road."
"4918",1,"Rooms were large, bed was comfortable, location was adequate. Motel needs some serious updates. Renovations are a must. Outside area was dirty and customers were allowed to work on their automobiles in the parking lots. My spouse and I will not again stay again without some of these things are fixed."

"4936",3,"Stayed here because rooms were blocked for a wedding. When we entered, the casino was very smoky and hot. They definitely need to move the air around better. The restaurant offerings are limited and some of them don't run well. The service in the restaurants was very slow. The room itself was spacious, clean and well priced. We had one day for a pool day, the temperature was 94 degrees. Imagine our disappointment when we found the pool is shaded by the building the entire day! Also, the pool amenities were all closed down. Huge disappointment -- huge! We would not have stayed here if we would have known. I did have a wonderful massage and it was a great value. If you would like to have the massage of your life, go see Elvira! She is awesome."

"4945",5,"Bad: Worst bartender ever. Long Island Iced Tea missing a few ingredients, King Alphonse was actually a Kahlua and cream with ice. Ugh. In-room coffee machine didn't work, took two days to get fixed, and then made awful coffee. Morning coffee from the restaurant was undrinkable. Thankfully, Starbucks nearby. Good: Best restaurant for dinner of any hotel anywhere. Entrees superb, bread pudding beyond superb. Excellent security staff -- Cheerfully and efficiently retrieved my forgotten keyboard, assured me it was safe, and FedExed it to me no charge.

"4947",3,"A good value hotel with all the amenities you need located on the main routes into and around Washington DC. Now looking a bit tired the rooms are functional and clean. The hotel operates a complimentary minibus shuttle to any location within 3 miles of the hotel, this includes the nearest DC metro station and a large shopping mall. The hotel is located literally on a highway junction which makes getting to and leaving on the right highway an entertaining challenge. The complimentary breakfast is a good start to the day. In summary, a good value option that ticks all the right boxes for a visitor on a budget."
"4948",1,"Something is seriously wrong with the hotel in this casino! Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much. Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern, and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation. At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature. While we can understand your frustrations, please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this. We hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip, the Grand Canyon must have been amazing to see in person!"

"4955",3,"The overall building is clean but showing some signs of wear...The front desk staff are very friendly, polite and helpful. Its in a safe area and there is a nice big mall a block down the street. There is a free shuttle that brings you right to the Springfield metro subway station. The breakfast spot next door is not an award winner, but hey it's included so don't complain. The only thing we didn't like is that some families hung out in the halls late at night chit chatting loudly. I guess it was our misfortune that night and the other thing was that the cleaning staff started vacuuming the halls like at 7 am in the morning and it wakes you up...other than that its okay for a short stay."
"4956",5,"Very nice hotel with many conveniences. We selected because they provide a shuttle to the airport and downtown. We were able to stay without having to rent a car."
"4957",5,"Bad: I can't think of anything. Good: The hotel was less than 1/2 mile to the strip (an easy 10 minute walk), which allowed me to be close enough to take advantage of it, but far enough removed to get away from the mega-ness of it. Check-in was easy, the staff was friendly and helpful, the size of the room was pretty standard (which is all I wanted or needed), the bathroom was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was comfortable."
"4958",5,"I've stayed here several times and am always pleased with my stay."
"4959",5,"Everything about our stay from the moment we checked in was a very positive experience. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The pool area was also nice and clean with plenty of towels and loungers available. The breakfast area was also clean and well attended to. We were also given a one hour late checkout which made my daughter extremely happy as it gave her a chance for one more swim before we left. A perfect stay while we were in the Keys!Thank you for the five star review. So glad to hear our folks at the front office were able to extend a later departure so your daughter could get that one last swim!! Thank you for sharing your experience and we look forward to welcoming you back to our little island!"

"4968",1,"We checked in at 6 pm, 3 hours after check in time of 3pm. Our room wasn't ready and housekeeping staff could be seen standing outside smoking. Granted I was given a 15 discount however, I would have happily paid another 50 per night to not be in that neighborhood. Employees smoking at the door to the lobby, the smell of weed in the hallway, a fight in the parking lot, literally people walking in off the street for the continental breakfast and asking us to use our cell phones, our room was 54 degrees upon entering.... I could go on and on, but won't. Needless to say I would never stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone. Our friends chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. And they would hang out in our room because theirs reeked. Regardless of how much Lysol of ours they used, it smelled. On a scale of 1-10 it was a 1."
"4969",5,"Quick check in, clean and comfortable large room. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Complimentary breakfast was excellent for this type of hotel. My only suggestion is that they please stock some plain black tea (only flavored teas were available). All staff we encountered were very friendly and welcoming."
"4970",4,"Just off I-95 and reasonably priced. Significant weekend savings on room rates but no free breakfast which is included with most weekday rates. Helpful and courteous staff. Meeting rooms for conferences and social gatherings."
"4971",3,"They were very helpful with restaurants. The location was very good as Sedona was very crowded. There are many beautiful hikes that are close to this destination. We ate at Cecina Rustica which was the best Italian food I have had any ware."
"4972",4,"I was very excited about the occasion - our short honeymoon (longer one to follow on our first anniversary) but was disappointed by one thing...the bathroom in the DoubleTree was so small that you had to actually come into the room and move over to the side JUST to close the door. Maybe it was because we had the special price rate, but I expected better from a Hilton brand hotel... Other than that, the room was nice, average size and the staff was very friendly. When they saw us come in (we were still in tux and wedding gown), they offered congratulations and of course, the cookies were excellent!!!"
"4973",4,"Convenient location to BART very big room outfitted with kitchette."
"4974",5,"I recently stayed at Brewster By the Sea while visiting my parents. This is the sister property to the Captain Freeman Inn in Brewster. Our stay was perfect and I knew it would be as I've stayed at the sister property twice. Our room was lovely. A 4 poster king bed, fireplace and comfy chairs..Impeccably kept property.

"4977",4,"I have been to the Charles several times over the last 20 years. Some parts of the hotel are consistent over the years: the rooms are clean and the staff is professional. But the experience isn't really a luxury experience with attention to small details. The hotel made a mistake around our rooms (they were supposed to be adjoining which... More"
"4978",3,"We did not get to the hotel until about 8:30pm. Left at 7:00am. Checked in and the person at the desk was very nice. Very good price for a short stay.

"4979",5,"Stayed 3 Nights. Hotel Ruby of Ponderay has a great appearance. There are many wide parking spots. It is nicely kept with a very open and modern looking lobby that includes a common area TV and dinning facility. The Staff is friendly and kind. Breakfast, though basic was good and satisfying with the bonus of a waffle maker (Which I always like). The room was very clean and the bed was soft and comfortable. Temperature control worked great. The room was not as spacious as other hotels rooms can be, but there is also no wasted space. Wifi worked very well and has several routers depending on what section of the hotel you are in. The pool and sauna were nice too. And did I mention the price. Best deal in town price wise. If I ever return to Ponderay, this Hotel would be my first choice."
"4980",5,"Since we had a 7:55 a.m. flight to the West Coast, leaving from in an unfamiliar area, we chose the Virginian based on its proximity to the airport. The check in was easy, the printed directions to get to Reagan Airport were concise and re-explained verbally."
"4981",4,"Wonderful last minute rate. Beautiful hotel in prime location."
"4982",5,"Enjoyed it greatly."
"4983",4,"We stopped and stayed for two nights while in Hawaii for ten days. Since I work with the resort back on the main land, I wanted to see it for myself.

Wifi worked great, and we had a good nite... More"
"4985",4,"Staff was very helpful and responsive. The rooms, pool and parking were not as clean or good as usual embassy suites but in no means bad for the value."
"4986",5,"Bad: I still really hate the cigarette smoke in the casino. But other then that (and all the crazies on the fremont experience at night) its fun and awesome!. Good: Location was perfect for our leisure trip. Free valet parking is always amazing (of course we tipped every time we picked up and dropped off our car!) The amount of things to do on the Fremont Experience is endless! What an awesome experience. Truly the 9th island for Hawaiians like us! We love it!"
"4987",3,"Good: Pool workout area"
"4988",3,"Nice hotel with Outdoor pool. No complementary coffee and bar closes early to get one there. A bit complicated with the billing process, but willing to solve it and did it as promised. Rooms have plenty of room. Limited selection of TV channels."
"4989",3,"Hotel confortavel, porem com algumas instalacoes antigas. No lobby e corredores muito bem arrumado, porem ao entrar no quarto sentimos um cheiro desagradavel. Me pareceu filtro do ar condicionado sujo. O banheiro estava limpo, assim como as toalhas e lencois. Em fim, para a regiao de washington, bom custo beneficio."
"4990",2,"Breakfast the first morning had molded bagels and fruit. I would check the food before you eat it."
"4991",5,"Stayed here a couple nights for work. Room was clean, linens were fresh, bed was comfortable, water was hot (taste great too), front desk folks were nice, breakfast was good, internet was fast, room ac worked great, smell was nice.

"4992",5,"To date, this takes the prize.

"4993",5,"I stayed for one night with a couple friends. We were in town for a concert. The hotel was clean, conveniently located, nice, and a good value. Hotel staff were helpful and friendly."
"4994",5,"When I open the room I was amazed how great it was. The bed, the pillows, the sheets, the towels, the bath. I had no idea for the price what a great place I would get"
"4995",4,"Bad: Outside the center and hard to reach without car! Internet usage requires registration with many personal details. Good: Good offer for the price!"
"4996",4,"I arrived a little earlier being I had been driving all night. I was ready to check into my room, but I had forgot that check-in time was at 3pm. I ask the desk clerk would it be ok if I could sit and wait the next 3 hrs in the lobby and she said yes. Well I guess she saw how tired I looked, she was nice enough to check with housekeeping to see if a room was ready. She allowed me to check in early and I am very grateful to her. Well I also want to commend the staff name Andre who were very helpful to make sure my stay at the hotel was satisfactory! Breakfast was stock when I went down and I was very please with the staff professionalism. I always stay at this hotel when I am in Suffolk, Va. Great Job"

"4999",5,"Recently, enjoyed with my family and grandchildren 3 nights at this quaint beautiful centrally located hotel. Our room was beautiful and although facing the front of the property, we had a beautiful view of the mountains. The flower boxes were so beautiful hanging on the small patio opening of our room. Hummingbirds flew on the window boxes taking nectar from the petals. It was very wonderful to see. The rooms are large and all accommodations were much like a 5+ hotel. Beautifully decorated we were very pleased with our rooms. We especially enjoyed the valet parking and Eric who was so helpful. The check in process was easy and accommodated our early check-in wishes. The European style breakfast was enjoyable with plenty of food to fill you up for a early day of shopping sight seeing and photo opportunity. Walk literally out the door and you are welcomed by the abundance of shopping and restaurants. We will most certainly book this hotel again."
"5000",2,"I expect VERY little from a hotel. I'm cheap by nature, and I really only want a door that locks and a shower that's hot. However, Hotel 502 made me rethink my low expectations and future travel plans. The front desk clerks ARE friendly and responsive, BUT, the rooms are very shabby and barely clean ('down there' hair on toilet seat, permanent mystery stain on sheets), the shower was cold/lukewarm (at best) and the neighborhood is less than desirable--LOTS of transients and sketchy folks wandering on property. I only paid 62 (+tax) per night, but if I had paid more I would have been really angry. As I said earlier, I really only want a locking door and hot shower (for 60+ I don't expect much). I can overlook the worn down rooms (I was told our room was renovated, but my mother stayed here when it was formally the Red Roof Inn, and said it looked the same, save a new t.v., and a different paint color on the bathroom wall). I can overlook the fact that a storm knocked out their WiFi and the pool was closed. I can overlook the people passed out drunk in their cars, and the less than clean room/bath. But NO hot shower Not good--even for 62 and some change. The only plus was the friendly front desk clerk--she gets kudos."
"5001",3,"Stayed at the Suncoast for a week in Feb. 2003. A big, impressive building but understand that it is about a good 20 minute drive on expressways to get to the strip. You will be at the extreme northwest section of the Las Vegas area making it time consuming to get to other parts of the city, but from what we saw this is probably the nicest area in greater Las Vegas (shopping, golf courses, restaurants). Good amenities at the Suncoast, the restaurants in the casino were all great and a good value. Bowling center, movie theatre, nice pool/spa area. Our only reservations concerned the (standard) room we had. The bed had unfitted sheets and mattress pad that just slid all over the mattress and bunched up. The first three nights whoever made the bed left the sheets a foot short at the bottom so that our feet were on the mattress pad. The carpeting looked a bit trafficked. Still, our overall experience was good."
"5002",4,"Close to Midway airport, great shuttle service, good interiors for the price. Would readily stay again."
"5003",4,"Buen servicio"

"5005",2,"There was a lot of miscommunication between me and the hotel pickup service. I used the metro the entire time I visited D.C. When I would get back I would have to be picked up at the Franconia-Springfield station or else it would take the driver over an hour to come pick me up, even if it was near the hotel. Additionally, there was not shuttle to Reagan National Airport. I had a flight to catch at 6:00 AM so the metro was out of the question, since it doesn't run until 5:00 AM. The hotel couldn't do because it was too far away. They were promoting a taxi service that was going to charge 40 to get to DCA. I was not impressed with this taxi service when I needed a ride from near the Hilton Hotel to Best Western (this cabbie thought New Mexico wasn't part of the U.S.). So I did use Uber to get to DCA."

"5013",3,"Wi-fi was hit or miss, breakfast was not good."
"5014",4,"Very satisfactory and comfortable.very convenient and met all our requirements."
"5015",4,"Nice size rooms. Breakfast and drinks and the reception a plus! The kids loved the pool. Very close to downtown, only 10 min. drive. We will be back!"
"5016",4,"The hotel is in very good condition, with a nearly completed renovation. Pool was nice. Breakfast was good. Miscue was that my room was assigned to another guest while assigned to me! Keys were made and given to this other guest. I was in the room when the other guest came to the room to move in."
"5017",1,"What a terrible experience. I reserved and prepaid through Hotels.com. I arrived close to midnight because of flight delays and was informed that the hotel was overbooked and that they had moved me to a hotel in Alexandria - 20 minutes away. I received no phone call, email or contact either from the Hotel or Hotels.com. The hotel they moved me too was in no way an equivalent hotel (half the price and they wouldn't refund me the difference which required me to through a fairly efficient but inconvenient process to call Hotels.com and request a refund), incredibly inconvenient and they also made me pay for a second cab to get there. I would not recommend unless there was absolutely no alternative. The night manager was at least friendly and sympathetic but powerless to do anything."
"5018",5,"no very good"
"5019",4,"Bad: The floors need more thorough cleaning. Good: Nicely situated hotel in Miami Beach. Pleasant architecture with patio-like outdoor seating area where you can relax. Friendly and helpful staff. Public parking one block down."
"5020",4,"Bad: missed not having a pool or somewhere to sit out and read. we were next to the railway so the train was noisy but we got used to it. Good: loved the food. beds very comfortable. excellent value."
"5021",4,"Met a group of guys down in Portsmouth for a weekend of NSW training. Didn't spend a ton of time at the hotel but I was pleased with my stay. The room was very clean. Had a nice comfortable king bed. Plenty of room. Had a couch as well. Breakfast wasn't all that. Had a waffle maker, eggs, sausage, sausage sandwiches, cereal, bagels, toast etc.. the sausage was that microwave junk. ate it the first morning but that was it. I didn't check anything else in the hotel out or have a need to seek service. I would stay there again."
"5022",4,"Stayed three nights on the way back to Phoenix Airport at the end of our holiday.The rooms were roomy clean but three light fittings didn't work, and neither did the TV remote.The pool was closed for one day when an underwater light fitting loosened and floated to the top of the water with electrical cables attached to the mains!!When visiting the breakfast area at 9.20am one morning, vitually nothing was left and it wasn't replenished. We had cereal and toast and that was it!!The redeeming feature at this hotel was Anthony on front desk. He was extremely welcoming, friendly and made us feel at home. I would stay there again because of the service given to us by him."
"5023",2,"They double-charged us for valet parking. For 2 nights we paid over 260 and they have yet to reimburse us. Expect to wait over 45 minutes to have your car fetched from the valet and pre-arrange for them to retrieve it before check-out."
"5024",5,"Good: Staff members very helpful and friendly"
"5025",5,"This is a nice hotel with great staff. I have young children and the entire staff from the front desk staff to the breakfast staff were there to help us. This was our first visit to the Portland area and we plan to go back later this summer. We will stay at this hotel when we return."
"5026",5,"They were very accommodating. We had a business meeting in Seattle, and we had to travel there with our toddler. The pack-n-play was already set up in the room when we got there. The internet was easy to connect and pain-free. The room was clean. Overall a very good experience."
"5027",5,"We stayed at the LaQuinta only one night, but will return at every opportunity. They're pet friendly which is wonderful. Now my baby can be our traveling companion. The room was great, clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and we were very pleased with our stay."
"5028",5,"Bad: Hotel restaurant was good but a bit pricey. Good: Very good value, located across from the beach but several blocks south of the chaos and noise. If arriving by auto, be aware that parking in MB is a problem. Private lots charge 30-40/day. I suggest parking in municipal garages within walking distance for half the cost."
"5029",4,"Poker room really great management very friendly and helpful. Many choices of food so it is not boring. Plenty of activities gaming plenty of choices We played in a slot Tournament won some money The resort always have nice offers to play and stay we had a really good time"

"5035",5,"This Hotel was amazing. My husband and I came here for one night to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. The staff was very accommodating and let us check in early. Andrew the front desk guy was awesome and sent us a bottle of champagne after I told him why we were here. The room was nice and spacious and the shower is on another level. There are lots of restaurants near by and places to walk to. The light rail is right next to the hotel so it was super easy to get to the restaurants and bars further downtown. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Andrew for making our stay amazing!Hello Amanda D, We thought you were pretty amazing too! I'll definitely share your accolades with the rest of the team. We hope you can try our restaurant, MATCH Restaurant and Lounge next time you stay. We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!"
"5036",2,"Only positives are location and friendly staff. Hotel is a dump and they add a surprise 15 convenience charge on top of everything.

"5038",3,"My recent three day stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington was pleasant enough, but it could have been so much better if the facility was simply updated with some relatively minor interior design modifications that would give it a fresh 2014 look. Adding some color to the walls, fabrics finishes, and beginning the process of incremental replacement of furnishings would elevate the hotel to the next level without breaking the bank, and allow the hotel to keep its very affordable rates intact. The location was great, in that it was a short walk or drive to much of Arlington's riverfront, the downtown commercial center, the METRO station, and the Key Bridge and Georgetown. The hotel is located on 1 mile from Interstate 66, so vehicular access was great. The beds were very comfortable, but the rooms were underwhelming from a design standpoint. The only problem I encountered was that air conditioning unit seemed a bit undersized. Overall, it was a very nice place to sleep, and I would stay there again, especially if cost were an issue."
"5039",3,"Overall I rate this hotel as average in some areas, and above in others. First the good: Price considering the Napa Valley location it was a good value, at check in we received our free breakfast coupons for Denny's adjacent to hotel. The location makes it easy to get downtown, or cross the bridge to Hwy 29. Staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful, its like they get it be friendly to your guests and they will either return or recommend your hotel to others.Average in outside noise is noticeable, doors closing, street noise, people walking in rooms above you, showers in the morning...etc. Hotel is somewhat dated yet clean and pretty well cared for.I would stay here again.Thank you for staying with us. We are always working on upgrading our Hotel. We are in the process of adding a workout room, guest laundry and business center. Customer service is always number one with us and we will see you again on your next visit to the Napa."
"5040",3,"Not the best hotel but it was clean enough and comfortable enough. Not sure what to expect when we arrived and had to pass by someone in the parking lot entrance asking why we wanted to get through, but it was okay. Average is the best word. Won't choose this place again but not bad."
"5041",5,"I would recommend staying at this location. The staff were extremely helpful. Rooms are clean, heating system is quiet, beds and pillows comfortable, internet access, and a very breakfast in the morning. Very good quality for your dollar."
"5042",4,"I expected much less for what I paid, but this place was great. Staff was excellent, good breakfast, able to get my laundry done cheaply, great rom and a great place. This will be first choice next time I'm in this area again."

"5054",5,"Good: Wonderful hotel with great location and customer service. The lounge was amazing every night for a drink and snacks. Couldnt have asked for a better experience. Breakfast every morning was way better then we expected. Contacting the front desk was easy via text for anything we needed or with questions. We have traveled to many other cities and Europe and this was one of our top stays."

"5063",4,"Staying over night with a few ladies (co-workers, friends) while attending a multi-day convention. This room was perfect for our needs. A king, a queen, a sitting area with pull out couch made everyone comfortable. Two bathrooms allowed everyone a little more time to get ready for the next day. Kitchenette was convenient to make an instant oatmeal for the next morning. Very comfortable beds. Complimentary purified chilled water near the elevator was a nice touch.Thank you, Chris9767 for choosing the River Hotel. We are delighted to hear you found the accommodations and hotel amenities to your liking. We appreciate you taking the time to post a review and look forward to welcoming you back soon.Kind regards,"
"5064",4,"Room was clean and comfortable. Friendly staff. Convenient location. Good place for families, couples, or business travelers. Did miss not having a workout facility, though not a big deal. This was a 10,000 Marriott points hotel -- and we have stayed in 20,000 point places that were less than satisfying."
"5065",4,"Overall we were very satisfied with our stay, here are a few comments: 1) the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful 2) We had two rooms and both were clean and nicely kept up 3) rather expensive for a Comfort Inn but given the location this is not surprising 4) breakfast is mostly plastic pre-prepared breakfast foods (typical of...

"5066",3,"This is located on the highway close to the air museum and makes it easy to drive to Dayton/Dundee area in one direction and less than 5 minutes from downtown McMinnville. The staff was very nice and our room was comfortable. They provide a free breakfast and have a pool."
"5067",5,"Bad: A fridge in the room would be super nice. Good: The room was very clean, beds comfy and 3 pillows. Every one was friendly. Great valet staff."
"5068",5,"An excellent value given the area. Very courteous and professional staff. We were astounded by the continental breakfast: complete w/chef! :) We enjoyed the since of security with the hotel's parking garage. Let's not forget the free drinks. ) A+++ would definitely stay again."
"5069",5,"Great staff and well taken care of facility!"

"5073",5,"In the words of Shirley Bassey: Where do I begin Jajaja. Well the rooms are sumptuous and big! Especially by NYC standards and compared to hotels of the same category. The service is amazing you feel pampered all throughout your stay. The food unfortunately is not up to the standard of the hotel. This doesn't mean it's bad at all, yet nothing spectacular. And last but not least the best part is that it has the best location!Dear CutbertoParraNicolin, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"5074",4,"Bad: Breakfast consisted of too much carbs (i.e. mainly bread, pastries and cakes), with no non-dairy options. Also the inability to use the stairs between floors without getting locked out!. Good: Location was great for the business conference and also shopping. The staff were friendly and always willing to help."
"5075",1,"I've stayed at plenty of budget hotels. I've always said, I don't care if the furniture is run down, the decor is outdated, etc., as long as it is clean.

"5079",4,"I thought the staff were very friendly, with an exception to one of the female pool staff. Perfect place for the kids though. We had an incident were our youngest got sick in the car, the front desk went out of their way to help, and within minutes helped me make an appointment for cleaning. They also recommended touring, although the touring company turned out to be a disaster! The downed elevator was a bit annoying. We read in a review that there was a cockroach in one of the rooms, and it was too bad that we also saw a quarter sized one in the breakfast area! We quickly told the kids it was a beetle. When I told the front desk about it, they were very apologetic and credited our parking."

"5083",1,"Dirty rooms. Outdated decor. Faulty lights. Bad odor. Terrible breakfast. Would not recommend or stay here again. Disgusting."
"5084",5,"The staff was extraordinarily friendly and helpful! Breakfast was delicious, they have this tasty citrus-water that is to die-for on the daily! My room was clean, fresh-smelling, and cozy. I couldn't have asked for a better stay, and I will definitely stay at this wonderful hotel again! FIVE STARS."
"5085",1,"The purpose of my trip was to attend the wedding and reception of a friend's daughter. I was only driving up for this, and was not concerned about luxury and amenities. From the pictures, etc., that I viewed on-line, it looked like a good place for a brief stay. However, the whole hotel is in great need of maintenance work. The metal walkway and steps outside the rooms were rusty. The bathtub was old, caulking needed, mildew stains on a plastic towel holder. There were water spots on the sink handle when we arrived. Towels and washcloths provided were threadbare. Cigarette butts littered the parking lot and the metal walkway and steps. The advertised continental breakfast was definitely bare bones--bread, bagels, and waffles to pop in a toaster, cold cereal and milk, muffins, coffee, tea, and orange juice available. No yogurt or fresh fruit. Had I not prepaid for the room, I would not have stayed. My friend and I decided to wait to shower or bathe until we'd done the four-hour drive home."
"5086",4,"Lots of construction but the room was nice and quiet. Surrounding area not very good but staff was very nice. Hotel room was accommodating to us. Bathroom was very small. Need better signage in front of the hotel."

"5090",4,"The location was super confusing, don't attempt your GPS. I called ahead, and they gave me directions led me right to the hotel. The hotel itself was outdated and def could use some work. The room was fine, with the standard amenities that is offered bu Holiday Inn Express. The breakfast area was in the lobby, a crapped area, but... More"
"5091",3,"The staff was very helpful. The room was comfortable but not clean enough. The rest of the hotel was also lacking."
"5092",5,"Bad: Our room was missed one night to clean (we didn't care about the bed, but we needed some supplies). It's OK, not a big deal. Good: Great location to visit Boston. Room was spacious and modern. Overall staff was professional and friendly."
"5093",5,"Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home! Best Hotel in NYC- have stayed in many , luxury and not,in NYC and all over the world. Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home. Our Signature Butler service differentiates us from the competition, and we are thrilled that you were able to experience this first hand.We look forward to welcoming you back to New York again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih Geray"
"5094",3,"Bad: There was not a dinette set in the room so that my husband and I could eat comfortably. The room was much smaller than I thought it was and there was no safe to put valuables in when we went out. I was not comfortable leaving any thing of value in my room. There was no outdoor pool as stated by you and there was no jacuzzi. Breakfast food was cold and not tasty at all. I don't feel like I got my money's worth from this resort and I will not be staying at Spring Hill Suites ever again. Good: I liked the king size bed."

"5096",4,"Rooms could use some updates: Beds a bit lumpy. Rugs need better cleaning. Desk in room wobbly. Chair uncomfortable. Breakfast: Eggs powdery. Staff was generally friendly and helpful."
"5097",5,"I love the small size overall. This is my third time here because I tag along while my husband is at a conference. The pool is perfect, with full sun AND cabanas. There is a wide choice of restaurants and all are well served. We saw a movie while there and had a nice choice of current movies."
"5098",5,"This site was very nice. It's close to the interstate and close to DC. You won't be disappointed."
"5099",5,"Even before I arrived at Soniat I had an insight into the warm hospitality that was the theme throughout our stay. From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality. Go, you won't regret it.Wow!You have made my day!What a kind and thoughtful review. Thank you so very much for taking the time.It would be a real pleasure to welcome you back."

"5103",5,"The Aloft hotel is in an excellent location, it is right next to city hall and the market and walking distance to so many other shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is extremely clean as was the hotel room. The room was on the smaller side, but if you're like me and my husband, you're not there to spend all your time in the room. It was plenty of space for the two of us. The bar downstairs is nice, we each enjoyed a cocktail there one of the nights. The only negative I would say is the expensive valet parking, however we went one block north on broad st and found parking for 15 dollars a day. Overall a great stay and highly recommended. Lindsay,Thank you for your kind words! We truly are fortunate to be in the heart of so many great things that Philadelphia offers. I am so glad to see that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you were able to relax not only in your room, but at WXYZ Bar as well.

"5104",5,"We got a free upgrade to a room with a jacuzi. It was right in the middle of the bed room... too funny! The beds where fine, the staff was great but the view from the top deck during breakfast....breathtaking!!!! I would go back in a heartbeat!"

"5106",1,"Absolutely disgusting!!! I rather stay in my car!!! Everything about this place is gross.. including the rude staff. This is not the Tropicana and should not be promoted as if it was apart of it. I will NEVER stay here again!!! Broken mirrors, dirty towels, smelly smoky room, old food in the refrigerator from a prior guest, toilet paper was on the floor, shower was moldy, creepy old elevator that sounded like it was going to break down... JUST PLAIN GROSS"
"5107",3,"Bad: Within the first 15 minutes of being there we got a complaint from a neighbor for having music too loud. The speaker was not even up half way and it was 4 oclock in the afternoon on a Saturday. At the end of the night staff were rude."

"5111",5,"The hotel staff, Ms. Vundee (I think this is how you spell her name) was an excellent hostess/ waitress in the breakfast room, she made the experience worthwhile. She was the only one who was very welcoming, cheerful, informative, caring in general a very good leader (she deserves a raise). The others in the front desk were average. The full breakfast was good with many options!"
"5112",4,"Hadn't stayed here before but had heard great reviews, although only downside was not right on the strip.

"5115",4,"Quiet neighborhood. Less than 10 miles to Sea World, Old Town, and Seaport Village. Double bed rooms do NOT have a sofa sleeper, as indicated when I booked (should be changed by now). We've stayed at several hotels in this chain, and we've always had a sofa sleeper and, usually, queen beds. Hotel staff was very accommodating, though, when I discovered this and they came up with a satisfactory solution. Breakfast is good, although very crowded."
"5116",4,"Bad: The room lacked hanging space and was quite small. Good: The staff were friendly and helpful. The bar and restaurant were nice"

"5122",5,"Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!"
"5123",5,"The staff were extremely friendly. Randall was very informative and helpful. The location is great, across the street from the Santa Monica pier. The room was quiet. The walls between bathroom and bedroom were see-thru glass. But there is a really cool privacy shade the lowers. It was clean and modern looking."

"5132",5,"I have a different opinion of Best Westerns after staying at this hotel. Very, very nice accommodations for the price. I would definitely go back again!We are glad we surprised you! Our newest surprises in store are a workout room, business center and guest laundry. We should have them up and running by your next visit to Napa. ps: sorry to ruin the surprise!"
"5133",5,"Great stay at this hotel. The staff are wonderful! The hotel is very close to City Hall and Reading Terminal. Great outdoor patio and fun lobby. The rooms are nice and bed comfortable. Hallways are a little narrow but is an older renovated building. Definitely would stay here again."

"5138",2,"We were in town to visit with our daughter and also see my brother. We stayed at the Hyatt House. The staff was friendly but not very empowered. Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait. The breakfast buffet was good, but they did not always restock items (including coffee lids) in a timely fashion. I don't recommend this hotel."
"5139",3,"The room was clean and quiet even with the freeway right across the street. Breakfast was OK but nothing to write home about. It has an indoor heated pool but it must of been heated by the moon because we didn't feel the heat only from the jacuzzi. Other than a cool pool we had a great trip."

Good: The staff were very friendly and helpful with questions regarding the best way to reach sites. The game room on the second floor was fantastic and not at all crowded which is what I had anticipated. The hotel photos are exactly what you see when you arrive (this is often not the case with other hotels I've stayed in)."

Manager was very nice and gave us a comp breakfast buffet."
"5162",4,"stayed here for a dog show weekend. Really appreciate being able to keep my dog with me here. Grounds are well maintained, but I did step in another dog's feces outdoors...dog bags would be great and a handy trash can. Room was clean and quiet and close to dining and museaums and 81. Bedding was lacking however - thin and even an extra blanket did not help much. Shower rocked and loved having a bathtub. Refridgerator never did get cold and the food I brought spoiled. good breakfast."
"5163",5,"Bad: The bar is a little on the expensive side. Drinks are very small for the price. The bartender we had was very slow and not very friendly. We waited about 10 minutes before we were served. It wasn't busy either. Good: Staff was very nice and helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient."
"5164",5,"What a wonderful surprise this hotel was to us!! We were greeted by the front desk and treated like royalty. Although we had to wait a half hour til our room was ready, they made sure we were comfortable and gave us bottled water. The room was GREAT. A huge bathtub was a delight. I don't normally take a bath... More"
"5165",2,"Staff is freindly and knowledgeable. However, it is overlooked by the poor house keeping. When I found hair and the smell of perfume on the sheets and comforter I immediately requested freshly washed linens. The chair I was giong to use appeared not to have been dusted in a couple of months, stains on just about every item... Strangely, the... More"
"5166",4,"Quick trip to my old home town for a class re-union. Affordable, and accessible, Room was clean and quiet."
"5167",4,"Bad: Breakfast was not included and in my opinion too expensive, especially for guests of your hotel. They told us it was a buffet and 15 per person. We didn't even check it out at that point. Good: Location was within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile. Price was reasonable for the location."
"5168",5,"Hotel was clean and neat. Rooms are wll kept, they have all the necessities that you would need. mornings get crowded at the continental breakfast. Staff very pleasant. overall a good experience."
"5169",4,"Overall, the stay was good. The staff, however, was a mixed bag. Lady at front desk was friendly enough, but gave us the wrong times for breakfast (telling us that breakfast was served to 10:00 on Fridays when it really stopped at 9:00 my teenage daughters almost missed breakfast). Also, the woman who drives the early morning shuttle to the airport as well as served breakfast on Wednesday morning was extremely RUDE. Made snarky comments to customers in the breakfast room and left a poor family with small children on their way to the airport, telling them that there was no more room in the shuttle when there was plenty of room. (My family were the only people on the shuttle and we pointed out that there was plenty of room and we were fine with waiting while they loaded on, but she would not wait for them.) On the other hand, the nice brunette, younger woman who worked the breakfast room on Thursday through Saturday morning was super friendly and accommodating and even made extra eggs for my daughters on the morning that they almost missed breakfast."
"5170",4,"The breakfast was not good. I kind of like the concept of serving breakfast in every floor, but I wish it could be more options for us that dont want to start every day with sweetened cereals and dough-nuts. But lots of places nearby that serves breakfast. Location. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see."
"5171",5,"We stopped at the Drury Inn on June 24th for a night as we headed to South Carolina. The Drury Inn was a pleasant surprise. It was a crowded night but everyone working could not have been nicer and efficient. We had a connecting room with family which was so helpful. The complimentary drink was a nice surprise and the...

"5172",5,"This hotel met all my standards: First foremost, it was clean. Secondly, the bed was comfortable. Shower looked new and had some nice features, in addition to having a modern shower head. Along that line, the room entire hotel was modern/refurbished. Good wifi reception."
"5173",3,"This has always been a great hotel, and one I have given good reviews to before. But this past weekend we stayed there, and the bedding was crap. Not at all comfortable. this room had one of those sleep number beds, where theoretically each side can adjust to the desired firmness. We couldn't get it to do anything, and the... More"
"5174",5,"We stayed two nights here while in town to visit with our son that lives in the area. The hotel was excellent. Room was spacious, beds were comfortable and everything works correctly.

"5181",2,"The hotel was very unclean and the staff acted as if it was a chore to do their job. I had items let in my room from previous consumers. My room had cob webs in the ceiling and the bathroom was dirty. I spoke with the front desk and she was very nanchalant, telling me someone would call be back but to this day no one called me back. My car almost got towed because the front desk person forgot to give me a parking pass to park on hotel property. I had to rushout to speak with the tow truck gentleman, then she gently said O i'm sorry, I forgot"

The beds were comfortable and the TV was great. We did have a problem with the refrigerator... More"
"5186",5,"The room was a little small but was right on the beach with a large balcony. It had a fridge and a microwave. The non oceanfront rooms are across the street as is the outdoor pool and additional parking. The free breakfast was good and open until 10:00. Everything was clean!"
"5187",2,"Check in staff were condescending when asking which room we had and made us feel less valued due to booking a budget room. General cleanliness of the room was ok, but a few hairs were found on the towels. The rooms also have very thin walls. The free parking and location to Heavenly was very good along with the proximity... More"

"5191",4,"Modern facility near center of town. Polite, efficient staff. Room was well appointed and clean. There was very little outside noise from adjoining rooms or the floor above. Complementary breakfest was very good. We would stay here again when we are in the area."
"5192",5,"This Hilton Garden Inn is perfect. It is in a very strategic location in the city and adjacent to the train. The rooms were very clean and staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again on next trip to Buffalo."

"5194",3,"Bad: Hotel was under a major renovation n there is no casino n no restaurants within the hotel. Ice machine was broken on our floor. You have to have key access to get ice from other floors but no access ever given. We had to ask 6 times for keys! They wouldn't work at all! Very very inconvenient! Apparently from what the staff said they have key problems all the time n i saw lots of guest going through the same problems. Staff is also rude in a professional way. Good: Beds we're comfy"
"5195",2,"3 nights of so so... Giant fans blowing in hallway all night.. Bland food... Smoke coming into the room from adjacent rooms... Closet sized bathroom... Very old motel somewhat spruced up... Should I go on I was disappointed in this hotel and would not stay here again."
"5196",2,"Front counter friendly but the bed was very uncomfortable and the tub was dirty and drained slow."
"5197",5,"We arrived later than expected on our way to Boston. Room was very spacious and everything is brand new so not much else to say. The front desk person was prompt, helpful and pleasant. Complimentary breakfast was very good. One of my pet peeves is hotel internet. This location has complementary and pay internet. The complimentary internet is fast enough... More"
"5198",5,"We loved our stay here! It was a clean and brand new facility with all the great amenities... free wifi, great pool, breakfast in the morning, friendly and helpful staff. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. It's in a great location too! Right next to the highway and just a quick 5-10 minute drive to downtown Charleston (King Street, The Battery, etc.) I would definitely stay here again!"
"5199",4,"I liked the place, the rooms were spacious. Beds were comfortable. Breakfast was OK, nothing spectacular. Only problem I noticed was the room was full of ants, plus there was a long skinny bug when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The Bahama Breeze next door was convenient."
"5200",5,"I've stayed at this hotel before and was pleased when Hotels.com again offered it at such a reasonable price. The hotel van comes promptly to the airport, check in was speedy and the room was clean and welcoming. The one issue was that I arrived at the hotel tired in the middle of the afternoon and the pool did not open until 6 PM. I get that they mostly get traveling businessmen but having the pool available in the afternoons would be a great advantage to work off some sore muscles and traveling frustration. Hotel itself though is great."
"5201",5,"As a result of an unfortunate booking glitch at another facility, we found The Esmeralda and fortunately they had a vacancy. It's rare that you stumble into a place that exceeds your expectations at every point but that was exactly our experience. Austin was the desk person and he booked us in to our cozy comfortable room and then escorted... More"
"5202",3,"This was my second stay at the St Regis NY. The hotel has been revamped is much more expensive bit i can't say it has much improved. On the bright side: got an upgrade and a very nice room, late checkout, the concierges are knowledgeable and get you in difficult places like the Polo Bar across the street.downsides: the Ducasse restaurant is gone and hasn't been replaced so you're left with a somewhat lame breakfast/diner lounge. The King Cole must be run trotskyists since i was refused entry before midnight despite identifying myself as an hotel guest. I duly complained and next day was served a deliberate over spicy bloody mary in what felt like retaliation. The hotel as a butler service that packs your stuff on demand. I lost i cherished Lanvin fedora on the process without so much of an excuse. Considering the price you pay you can find better options in NY. By the way i'm an SPG Gold so the upgrades and late check outs come with the status.Dear Joao C, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted. I may be reached at Octavia.margineanstregis.com, and we would then be able to arrange a time at your convenience to speak.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"5203",5,"Sold our house and couldn't move into new house for several weeks. Spent a week at this hotel. The staff was VERY accommodating. Marilynn, who serves the free breakfast, was very nice and welcoming. Housekeeping did a great job as well."
"5204",4,"We used the motel as a base camp while we explored the greater Flagstaff area and toured the Grand Canyon. My wife's back has a hard time with most motel beds, but this bed gave her no problems whatsoever."
"5205",5,"Reviews on Tripadvisor were very good for this place and the price was quite low . . . so we thought we would take a chance on it.

"5206",5,"My family of six wanted a hotel that would be comfortable but did not offer many amenities that would up the price because we did not plan to be in the hotel except to sleep. I found this hotel very comfortable and clean and would recommend it for a family on a weekend stay (as it is located in a technology park and might be busier during the week). It was relatively inexpensive and close to both Baltimore and DC."
"5207",4,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night for the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington this past weekend. It was more than adequate for being a place to spend the night. We liked that the room and bathroom were spacious. The location was ideal for someone who drove to the area. I believe the hotel also has a shuttle to the nearby metro station. It is a 15-20 minute drive to Washington in regular, non-congested traffic. The breakfast buffet was standard but I would really expect much for the price we paid. I like that they have their own parking lot and they are just down the street from numerous fast food establishments and a supermarket. The gentleman at the reception desk was a bit short with us and another couple who were checking in before is but nothing that is worth complaining about. Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is a good bargain and is close to highway access and public transportation."
"5208",5,"Good: The staff was incredibly accommodating! The pool was open 24 hours which was perfect for a late night dip after walking the strip! The view was gorgeous, and conveniently located near the strip."

"5225",4,"We had a terrific view of the ocean and beach. The room was big, the beds and pillows was comfortable. The only problem was the fan in the shower/toilet room was extremely noisy, the toilet was too close to the toilet paper dispenser and there wasn't enough counter space for our toiletry items. We had to leave most things in our toiletry bags and use the items from them. Otherwise, the room was great and it was nice to hear the roar of the ocean every night. All staff was very friendly however we were told that there would be a concierge who would sell us tickets for the whale cruise but we never saw a concierge for the 2 days that we were there. We went directly to the cruise ticket office instead. We will probably stay there again if we go back to Virginia Beach."

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it to any business travelers."

"5232",3,"I booked my trip with the understanding that I would be staying at a Hyatt Regency Hotel. I did not find out until I arrived that the hotel had changed hands as of Dec 1st and under construction.We arrived Christmas day. It was a mad house, a Chinesse Christian Convenetion was in progress, not a problem. The problem was that was the convention was the main focus of the hotel staff - no Coffee kiosk, no hotel shop and limited staff. We were able to get food from the Sports bar - not a very good experience, again no staff.The construction began at 8:00 AM and ended at 3:30 Mon through Friday.So loud we were moved 6 floors."

When the food arrived the food orders were small and not cooked properly.  For the price we paid for breakfast we could have gone to a nice restaurant in town and the food would have been better and more plentiful.

"5267",3,"I found a large bug in the bathroom, someone else's old coffee filter bag in the coffeemaker, shower curtain bar broken, and on a near freezing night (35 deg low), the heat didn't work, it only made a dangerous sounding electrical noise."

"5269",4,"This hotel is off exit 63 just off I85 with chick fil a, cracker Barrell, Wendy's, Zaxby's nearby. Our room was spacious and clean. The fold out couch linens were also clean. The room furnishings could stand to be updated, but they served their purpose. We were surprised with the full kitchen in the room. Breakfast was good, tables not... More"
"5270",2,"I understand that this is an older hotel, but I would hope with the Days Inn name, it would be kept up better. The rooms are in drastic need of updating. The room was not as clean as one would expect, and the elevator was dirty. As far as the free breakfast....disappointing doesn't begin to express it. One guest advised one of the staff members that the hot food was not being kept at the required temperature (in fact, it was cold) and there was NOTHING done. The milk for the cereal was left in a pitcher on the counter to get warm. The staff that we encountered was pleasant, but it was not enough for my husband and I to stay there again."
"5271",5,"I liked the big, clean room. The deep tub was a plus. Friendly staff, check in was fast. The bed was comfortable. There were plenty of pillows and towels. The room was quiet even though there were people in the nearby rooms."
"5272",5,"This Hampton Inn is very new. It is clean, beautiful and comfortable! The breakfast was good and the eating area was super nice. The staff was exceptional! I would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again - and I am very particular about hotels!"
"5273",3,"Bad: The cockroach in my bed- crawling on my liklow. Good: Staff was very nice!"
"5274",5,"Free breakfast is an added perk however the same food 3 days in a row i couldn't face cheese omelets and sausage for the 3rd day so i ate out. a little variety here would be nice. also check out is 11 am. housekeeping was knocking on my door at 8:30. i felt like i was being rushed out. room was super clean and spacious. the location of the hotel is excellent."
"5275",4,"It's not a 5-star hotel. It's a Motel 6. But it's a Motel 6 right in the heart of Scottsdale, next to the mall, breakfast places, bars, restaurants and clubs with an easy walk anywhere on Scottsdale Road all the way to the ballpark. You know it's a Motel 6 going in. You will get what Tom Bodett says, A... More"
"5276",5,"We were welcomed with cold drinks and a smiling friendly receptionist and manager as we looked tired after walking from the station. They asked why we had not rung for the shuttlebus (we tried but we had called the wrong number). We always used it since (the driver was NOT the smiling type). The continental breakfast was nearer a full breakfast as there were some cooked items."
"5277",5,"Excellent customer service. The purpose of my trip was getting surgery at LSI and the staff at this hotel location was spectacular! They could not do enough for me and my family. Thank you to the entire staff!"
"5278",3,"The renovations in my room were very inconsistent. On the positive side, the living area and the bed room were nicely updated with modern furniture, quality curtains, and a very comfortable bed. But, the kitchenette and bathroom looked as though they hadn't been updated in decades. The cabinet doors were hanging askew, the bathroom door was in desperate need of paint, and the tub was old, stained, and yellowed. Also, I had a remote control that didn't work, a lamp that didn't work, and a drain that stopped up and spilled water into the floor. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again."
"5279",2,"It was a recently built hotel allowed to fall into disrepair. Staff was gone or unhelpful. Room felt like a motel 6. Maybe. Was ok for 85. But no more. View of interstate exit ramp. I would recommend most other places. It did in a pinch and was close to dc. Didn't feel unsafe. Just unkept. It was fine to sleep in. And the pool was nice."
"5280",3,"This was our first stay at this hotel though we generally stay at a Hampton Inn when travelling. This was by far the worst condition we've ever found a Hampton in. I believe a renovation and upgrade throughout the hotel would benefit this location greatly."
"5281",4,"We stayed here one night while passing through town. The room was very clean, spacious but just a touch too costly at 131 a night. 100 for the family sized room is more realistic. Oh Well. Nothing really bad to say.I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience."
"5282",5,"We loved the Hyatt Place Baltimore! Harbor East is a fantastic neighborhood, full of shopping and great restaurants. It is convenient walk to the bay and to Fell's Point. The rooms are very nice and the staff were very courteous. Thank you for a great long weekend!"
"5283",5,"I love the location, the staff, the restaurants, THE BAR, the rooms and all of the extra services that are offered here where staff remember so many little details about previous trips that each return is like an extended day from the last stay."
"5284",5,"I recently hosted a birthday party at this hotel -- and I cannot say enough about the team of people working here! To start, we had a small miscommunication over the phone -- but their staff said 'no problem,' and totally made arrangements to accommodate me! Then, on the day of our event -- the staff was helpful, kind, engaged... More"

"5290",5,"Rooms are spacious, clean, and staff are excellent. The ONE thing that stood out (unfortunately), was the coffee. I am a coffee drinker. I've had too many brands to count.

"5295",2,"Although the view was very nice, the efficiency room facing the cove left a lot to be desired. There were only 3 forks and one butter knife in the drawer, nothing sharp enough for a grilled steak so that plan was scrapped. The room was miniscule and not very clean. There was mold on the inside of the fridge along... More"

"5298",3,"i made this choice because it was close to the airport and we were not arriving until late. did not want to have to drive around trying to find a hotel."
"5299",5,"L'hotel e a 20 minuti da Washington ma si raggiunge facilmente grazie ad una superstrada e il prezzo e molto conveniente rispetto alle grandi catene presenti in citta."
"5300",4,"The only complaint I have about this hotel is that my sink was stopped up, but they did come and fix it right away. The toilet was running and continues until our stay, but that didn't bother me too much. They were repaying the parking lot and didn't have it posted anywhere and with them having the bar downstairs you had to park way over by the other building and walk to the hotel."
"5301",3,"While the place is marketed for people looking for a short-term apartment existence, the place definitely held that feel. The lobby was a bit run down but overall not bad. Just"

"5307",5,"Bad: Great staff very accommodating. Clean friendly."

"5311",4,"The Colonial Hotel is a really decent place. It's neat, clean, and seems to have the amenities one would expect for the price. We booked both a king and double queen room.

"5312",4,"This hotel is located in the center of the historic district and is a short drive from wine/farm country. The staff is extremely nice but lacks the polish of staff at comparable hotels in larger cities."
"5313",2,"Bad: Rude Staff."
"5314",5,"We usually look for Drury Inns when we travel. This location is very convenient off the highway. I liked the out door area by the pool. We had a great suite, highly suggest the suites to families. The mall is across the parking lot and convenient."
"5315",5,"Good: The AC hotel was perfect for what we needed. We were a group of friends coming from different states to meet up. It was conveniently located close to public transportation and made it easy for all of us to get there. The hotel was in a great location! It's close to Michigan Avenue/ Water Tower Mall and Navy Pier."

"5319",5,"Everything about this hotel is geared to the DC business traveler. Nothing is missing from the standpoint of communications inclusive of wireless net access. They provide more than just coffee and danish in the morning there is real food. Plus snack items designed to help you make it through a difficult day on the Hill. Convenience to the Metro is a big plus, and it's provided by a shuttle. Wait staff goes out of its way to accommodate and address problems if any. We have, of course, other options as far as where to stay in the DC area, but this Best Western has my vote hands down right price, right place, right service. It's a winning hand all the way."
"5320",4,"My experience with Best Western has been very good. I like their chain especially in their newer facilities. I typically seek out this chain as well as Hampton and other high end chains. The breakfast though good, would be better if there was more selection. The parking was tight and getting in or out of the facility by auto can... More"
"5321",4,"Although the hotel was a bit run down we enjoyed our week long stay. The staff were really helpful and friendly and it had a swimming pool which was a bonus! The shuttle service is good.

"5325",4,"We stayed here after our cruise and chose this hotel because of its free shuttle and restaurant on site. Our room was larger than expected and cozy, we were able to get an early check in without calling ahead, and were in our room by 11am. The pool area is nice and clean, staff was helpful. Would stay here again."
"5326",5,"Love this place"
"5327",5,"Bad: Loved everything about Virgin Hotel. Good: First and foremost the staff - just wonderful. Friendly and very patient with all the enquiries we made!

"5339",3,"Bad: Best days of this hotel are far behind and the interior would need a major upgrade. When you enter the Room you first notice a bad smell due to combination of moisture and lack of proper ventilation. The air condition was extreamely noisy. You can also hear all voices from the corridor and other rooms. Good: Good location. There was a comlimentary coffee machine available at the lobby. Good bed."
"5340",3,"Decently clean room, but beware if you have allergies. Hotels should offer an alternative to goose down pillows. Hypoallergenic pillows would have been nice instead of having to buy my own. Also, a/c unit in room was quite loud."
"5341",5,"I find that Candlewood Suites offers an excellent stay for the price. It is better much than a lot of more expensive hotels. The hotel is always very clean. It offers the best in creature comforts and each room is very well organized for business travel."
"5342",3,"Last minute decision to stay here. Front desk was friendly and helpful. Cheap price got us exactly what we expected - a no frills, bare bones room.

"5343",5,"Love this hotel. Beautiful lobby and very good restaurants. The coffee in the room was delicious and the maker easy to use-sometimes one must move the coffee maker etc... The best part of the trip is that the hotel is quiet. I couldn't hear other doors in my hallway banging closed."
"5344",2,"Was really excited to stay in a historical hotel. Got in very late and requested a very quite room. Was informed that there would be no one at the front desk after 11:00. Got in my room and settled in, noticed toothpaste in the sink, hair on the floor and in the tub but of course by this time there was no one at the front desk..Turned the TV off and went to bed but the music from the nightclub kept me awake until they closed at 2:am. I will never stay there again! Very disappointed!!"

"5352",5,"I stayed at the Brookshire Suites for one week and enjoyed my stayed. One thing that I was really disappointed with was the room service they did not do a good job at cleaning the room. Out of the 5 days that I stayed there, I only allowed room service to clean my room on the third day. I expected them to resupply me with all the essentials in the bathroom. I was short on towels, soap, and shower gel. I was more furious when I notice that they did not provide me with a trash bag for the room trash can. Not to mention that when I walked in on the first day of my stay, under the sink there was a bag filled with trash from the previous stay. It did not bother me at first but after noticing how awful there room service is led me to write this review."

Waiting staff in the breakfast area were very helpful and attentive. Thank god the friendly staff next door at the Fontaineblur were there to save the days n nights!"
"5358",4,"The location is just amazing. I was in Miami for a business conference, however I wanted to actually enjoy my stay so I booked this hotel. It is right on the beach and has amazing views. Since I am on work hours, I rarely have time to relax and having the beach merely seconds away is superb. The staff was... More"
"5359",4,"Bad: Closest parking was a 4-5 minute walk away for 28 overnight. Closer parking is available for 48 overnight. Good: Great neighborhood on Boylston and a block from Newbury St. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance to choose from. It is one of the better values compared to other hotels in Boston. Half a block from the Copley T station if you want to get to another part of the city. 15- 20 minute walk to Fenway Park for the Sox game."

Only reason four instead of five stars is the hallways and my room smelled kinda like a sweaty, bad-smelling locker room. I said something to the hotel and then the smell was gone.

"5381",3,"Location is perfect, right across from Santa Monica pier and we walked to Venice Beach in the morning (2 miles each way). Also walking distance from 3rd avenue shops so really perfect location. Hotel itself is very modern, sleek, hipster. For example, the shower is completely clear although there is a privacy option. Room size is average/small. I prefer more... More"
"5382",4,"Good: Coffee and juice were nice to start out the day with! Cold cereal would have been a plus."
"5383",4,"I have stayed many times at this hotel over the past 20+ years and prefer it to the others I have tried in New Orleans. I have also recommended it to friends and colleagues who were very pleased. It is somewhat pricey but you will not be disappointed."
"5384",5,"I thought the overall experience at the hotel was very good. The only thing I did not like was that the cleaning of the room was late in the day after 2pm."
"5385",5,"Great overall experience Staff was very friendly. Got a hot cookie when I arrived. Had lunch and breakfast at the restaurant located on the water with a nice view of the Queen Mary. Food and service was excellent.Thanks for the wonderful review and comments. We are so happy you enjoyed the hotel and look forward to your return."
"5386",5,"Ha! I've always wanted to use that song title for a review. ARIA has given me the opportunity to do so. Now, there were only two issues with my ARIA stay. Check in and the numbering system in the hallways. The hotel receptionist had a hard time divvying up our check in, understanding that several nights were to be paid... More"
"5387",5,"Convenient and comfortable. Staff is great, breakfast and WiFi is a bonus."
"5388",5,"Bad: No one knew where the sauna was located. Good: Bed was amazing, bathroom was amazing, great view"
"5389",5,"Everything went as planned. Nice free breakfast. The free WiFi was a bit slow, the TV/Cable had some quirks but was manageable (no HD). The pool was bath temperature (Very Warm!). Shower had nice pressure, and the beds were firm but not hard. We had a problem one night with the lock on the bathroom door and the folks at the front desk were helpful."
"5390",5,"We loved this Hotel, great location, clean and staff very friendly and helpful. They even let my dog come for no extra charge! we would go back in a heartbeat, infact next year we are.."
"5391",5,"Awesome hotel. Breakfast unbeatable. I love the fact that they really honor the BW Rewards program. Excellent clean suites. Enough parking available next to your room. Tremendous restaurant to choose close to the hotel, an enormous luxury mall and a beautiful movie theater."
"5392",5,"Everything met or exceeded our expectations on this leg of our trip. The property was clean, organized, and very easy to navigate. The upstairs game room would appear to have everything you could want if you desired to stay in and relax. As far as the breakfast is concerned, we very much enjoyed it. We didn't not expect the service... More"
"5393",5,"This hotel is just two block to Bourbon Street and close enough to walk alway to Cafe DuMonde. Safe area. Bed very comfortable and hotel perfectly clean and nice. I will stay here again every time I am in NOLA. LaQuinta rates for Sheraton level hotel. Great value at great prices, what a winner! Thanks so much for staying with us at Aloft New Orleans Downtown and taking the to post your review. Come back soon."
"5394",4,"Overall it was pretty good...the staff were excellent..the free breakfast was GREAT. However, the shower didn't produce cold water until the 3rd person took a shower. Also, we didn't have a refridgerator in the room, so left overs from resturants were out of the question. But loved to have the ability to take a shuttle to the Metro Station, that then took me the DC so I didn't have to drive for a tour of DC. GREAT!!!"
"5395",5,"Industrial vibe, very new. Comfortable rooms. Fair value. Good location. Other food and coffee options in walkable distance. Ate breakfast onsite two mornings -- the menu is diverse and creative with good prices.Thank you Joel! We're happy to hear you had a great stay. We hope to welcome you again in the future."
"5396",4,"So there is nothing wrong with this hotel. It is average and what you would expect of Holiday Inn Express. I am glad that we got the reservations on Hotels.com. The rooms were conveniently priced and I thought the services of the hotel were fine for the price I had paid. However, when we inquired about staying an extra day the room cost twice as much. I understand that getting reservations early and using a service like hotels.com is much cheaper but I could not see paying twice as much money for such a mediocre hotel."
"5397",3,"We had a smooth early check in and was given an upgraded room. The room was gorgeous and I enjoyed the jacuzzi. The casino was a little smokey and the buffet was nice although I did find a piece of plastic in my greens, the manager did apologize for that. I would have rated higher but we were awakened by... More"
"5398",4,"Decent hotel. Nothing fancy. Just the basics. Even the casino area is quite small and only has basic games and machines. If you need a clean room to just sleep in. This is the place. If you need excitement. Then this is not the place for you."
"5399",3,"homey. nice terraces. Lovely living room. unpretentious. not your standard-issue motel."
"5400",4,"We evacuated to this hotel ahead of Hurrican Irma from Florida. The staff couldn't have been nicer or friendlier. Decor not much, but decent size room. The 4-star rating is for the staff and extra's. They have nice amenities--indoor/outdoor pool, small fitness room, but very nice and accommodating hot breakfast (free) AND free Happy Hour with 3 drinks each AND hot and cold appetizer buffet, which was enough to eat as dinner. There was nice green, tossed ( fresh) salad, soup, chili, hot dog bar, nacho bar, Italian pasta, chicken fingers, cheese, fruit, and one to two other items I do not remember. What I ate was good--did not try chicken fingers. Thought it was a nice extra for what you would normally pay for a hotel."
"5401",4,"Small hotel with very helpful, friendly staff. Light, airy hallways with fruit bowls in the lobbies. Good breakfast at the restaurant next door. Very comfortable. Parking available across the street. Easy access by car to Marin Headlands for memorable views of the Golden Gate Bridge."
"5402",1,"The hotel was obviously last decorated in the 1980s. It is definately NOT A RESORT! The work-out center was dirty. The pool was much smaller than the 1980s brochures depicted. The brochure shows someone sitting on the island. There is a sign indicating that you must stay off of the island. There is a young girl in a raft in the swimming pool on the brochure also. That is laughable! A female bartender (description: Caucasian w/ longer brown hair-sorry, all I've got) was EXTREMELY RUDE during EVERY INTERACTION! The comforter had a blood stain on the side that sat on the pillows. The outside of the balcony door was completely rusted. The room door was paper- thin. We heard every normal volume conversation that went on outside of the room including the ones that occurred at 3 a.m. Truly, we were awakened several times during each night, just by conversations occuring in the hallway. The noise level was by far, the worst part of the stay. We got very little sleep."
"5403",1,"When I arrived at my room it was unlocked. There was a strong musty smell. Being so tired I tried to go to sleep. I woke up not being able to breathe. (I don't have allergies) The hotel was full so I was unable to switch rooms. I asked to check out of the hotel. There wasn't a manager on duty so they refused to check me out. I will never stay at a Ramada facility again."
"5404",5,"This is always a great hotel, neat, clean, courteous staff, great breakfast, quiet so you can get a good nights sleep, overall one of the best if not the best hotel I've ever stayed at.Thank you so much for your review of our hotel and staff. We appreciate your feedback. We hope to see you again in Decatur, IN."
"5405",3,"I have told the Westin I am going to leave honest feedback on my experience and will do so. First, the hotel is beautiful. Guests commented on the amazing and historic beauty it had to offer. Rooms are a bit pricey, but comparable to other hotels in downtown Greenville. In fact,... Read More rooms in the room block here were cheaper than what other hotels were going to offer in blocks. The complimentary night for the wedding was an added plus. We had our reception in the Gold Ballroom and that, too, was a great location site. It was stunning and if you want a reception in a ballroom, I wouldn't have anything negative to say about it. I caution you if you plan on solely relying on the hotel's event planner. While she sets up everything for you (or instructs the staff, I'm not entirely sure), I still had a day of coordinator and do not regret that choice one bit. My DOC had to fix the centerpieces since they did not match the pictures provided. Also, my DOC was present through the ENTIRE reception. The hotel's planner typically does not stay until the end of the reception and also was not there Sunday during our departure to help us locate some of our items. The hotel's planner is not consistently present during the reception, especially if there is another wedding or event in the hotel. She is present only here and there, but not consistently. We had an issue with our champagne toast and had to send my DOC to try to locate the hotel's planner or anyone to help. Overall, the hotel's planner was useful in organizing the details, planning food, etc. She ensured the timeline generally flowed and we got to where we needed to be. At times, communication was hard and responses to questions were delayed. The overall package price, in my opinion, was helpful. Next, we had issues with the clean up of the event, which is part of the package. The staff told my DOC they were not going to pack up the reception decor, which resulted in my DOC, father, and several groomsmen spending an hour or two packing up the items and then carrying them to my father's room. As the hotel planner was not there at the end of the reception, there was no one to talk to about what was happening. Needless to say, the end result was a DOC I needed to compensate for time outside our contract and a not very pleased Father of the Bride. After some pressing to the Westin, compensation was given for this. I can at least give them credit for rectifying a wrong though it did take some pushing. For reception food, it was fantastic. We had many compliments on the steak, sides, etc. The staff was attentive and the bar service was quick. My father had lots of positive things to say about the staff and especially liked Eric. Eric is a jack of all trades - he was the bartender at the rehearsal, bell hop at various points, waiter at the reception, van driver on Sunday. If you have Eric doing anything, you are in good hands. We also had a fantastic server, JJ, at the wedding - we loved her, too. The Westin suggested doing wine passing during dinner and closing the bar as a cost saver. In the end, this was more expensive than simply doing another hour for the open bar. You are charged taxes, gratuity, and services fees for this hour though the contract states this is part of the package; this was an issue and I'm still not in agreement that it was right since it was never mentioned. Think twice about this option. Most of our decor was returned - a few items were missing."
"5406",3,"The room was adequate but not anything else. I stayed here because it was the only room I could get because of a Jazz Fest at the Hampton Coliseum. The rate was about 2.5 times the regular room rate definitely not worth the price, but I had no choice."
"5407",2,"Better maid service"
"5408",5,"Bad: Rooms with connecting doors can be very noise due to poor noise control of these doors. Good: Great location, very friendly staff, great vibe"
"5409",3,"Bad: They don't even offer you some water or a complementary drink or fruit. Comparing to the charges."
"5410",5,"We stayed for our 25th wedding anniversary and the room was great. Huge bed and very comfy. The room was clean and everyone was so nice. You get free drinks and food at 5:30 which I thought was great. It was a wonderful stay and we will definatly visit again."
"5411",5,"My wife and I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. We regularly vacation in Las Vegas because of the climate. We discovered the Suncoast several years ago and stay there frequently. The casino offers tons of entertainment, has bowling, several movies theatres, great restaurants and is surrounded by awesome golf courses. The Suncoast is located in Summerlin which is the best neighbourhood in Las Vegas. Needless to say, we love it. We will absolutely be back.Thank you for visiting us! We look forward to you visiting again."
"5412",4,"One elevator for this large 10 story hotel was not good. Also all the hallways and elevator were extremely muggy and hot. When we arrived we had to park in the far extra parking lot and carry all of our luggage I. The pouring rain bc they allowed bikers to park under the entire awning unload rock. Very dissapointed in that lack of customer service. Other than that we had a beautiful room with very comfortable beds and a great view."
"5413",5,"Bad: Had a very frustrating time booking online. The website was not secure. Good: Clean. Very important!"
"5414",4,"We drove up from the San Francisco Bay area to meet our son in Redding. He goes to school in central Oregon so his drive was a little longer compared to ours. The hotel staff is friendly, the rooms are very clean, and the beds are super comfortable. The free breakfast is also another very nice touch. If you are... More"
"5415",4,"Quiet, clean, spacious. Only complaint is the beds were sacked out. We're traveling cross country and just need a place for a good night sleep and a shower for a reasonable price. This place fit the bill. Ate downtown at Buon Appetit and it was great also"
"5416",3,"This is one of the newer Four Points, not sure if it was built as a Four Points or a conversion from another brand. That said, it's in great shape. Located just a couple of miles from the airport, it's easy in and out of there. They do have a free shuttle that appears to run on demand (I had... More"
"5417",4,"This was a good stopping point with our two kids. Breakfast and wifi were good. The desk clerk enrolled us in the rewards program when they heard we'd be staying in a BW hotel twice more in the next year. Corridors a bit dated but everything worked. We would definitely use this hotel again."
"5418",4,"This hotel accommodated multiple family reunions very well. You can't beat the location. It's directly across from the mall, walking distance to several restaurants and minutes drive to others. Yet, you don't have to leave if you don't want to. There's a heavy manager's reception each evening with complimentary adult beverages and a buffet meal: pasta, hotdogs, meatballs, baked potatoes,... More"
"5419",5,"Accessible to any places you want to go. Not that much of amenities in the hotel but still safe and cozy to stay in. Everyday they have Craby Hour - Free food/drinks."
"5420",5,"Bad: Nothing. Good: Extremely friendly staff. They help you in every difficulty. You can depend on them."
"5421",1,"We made our reservation in advance. When we arrived the lobby was very cluttered and dirty . We checked in and paid cash for our rooms. When we entered our room it had a very bad odor. I pulled the bedspread and sheets back and there appeared to be some type of small bugs. The sheets and bedspread either were... More"
"5422",3,"The primary complaint was the inability to enjoy the pool and the beach, because work renovations were going on that left a steady snow like shower of Styrofoam sprinkles that blew over everything and coated the pool. It would seem that some type of netting could have been installed to have prevented this. Hotel patrons had to vacate both indoor and outdoor pools for staff to attempt to clean up the residue and of course there was no sunbathing to be had under the circumstances. So much for our ONE beach day."
"5423",4,"easy check in good breakfast clean rooms nice large bathroom"
"5424",5,"Our whole experience here was really positive. Rooms were clean, comfy and cosy with some fun artwork. Staff were friendly and accommodating. The food at the downstairs restaurant was delicious too and parking was really easy. Would thoroughly recommend.Thank you for this amazing review Melissa! We hope you will visit again soon."
"5425",2,"The Hotel itself is nice and fairly clean. However, booked the hotel months ago and when we arrived, which was late and after 12am, we were told that our twin room was not available, they had sold it, and we could have a double room with 1 bed. They were going to put up a portable bed, but took them a while to find it. We were offered to go to other hotel, but they were fully booked too. The hotel changed the room the following night, but no compensation, apart from a free drink which we had to fight for as well, were offered."
"5426",5,"Bad: Nothing. Good: Rooms were big and very clean, the smell of the room was awesome. The staff are very friendly and the location is perfect"
"5427",5,"Bad: Shower. Good: Doorman was wonderful- very helpful."
"5428",4,"We were impressed at the thoughtfulness of the staff. There is a complimentary breakfast which starts at 7:00am but we left early so we would miss it. The staff offered us bagels and bananas to take with us on the road. A small but truly appreciated gesture. The room was large and comfortable. Good for traveling with a family. The only issue was that the bathroom door did not close well. We did not address this with the hotel as we were just there overnight."
"5429",1,"I pulled into Motel Parking Lot that was empty except for homeless guy with his shopping cart. Motel Sign light blinking as if burning out. Broken bed frame tossed away at side of building. Didn't even get out of car, went to Hotel next door. when calling to cancel, was met with questions as to why, owner not very understanding."
"5430",5,"Upon Arrival, I was greeted warmly by Ashlee at the front desk. She knew my first name and that we were there for our daughter's weddding! What a difference from the previous two nites we had spent at the Torrey Pines Hilton.I will review that hotel as well.... For me, it is all about service, and I was so impressed... More"
"5431",2,"Not very good. Room had many issues. I had a total of 3 rooms and there were problems in each room particularly mine. Hotel staff is not very friendly. Probably overworked due to the fact that one person does about 4 different jobs. Cannot and will not get the attention you need if there is a problem"
"5432",4,"I've stayed at the Comfort Inn for several years while attending the RVIA Expo. For the first few years it was an older version of what it is now. The rooms have been renovated, the carpet is clean and the beds are great! I'm picky about beds and these are better than some of much higher priced hotels I've stayed... More"
"5433",5,"My room was in a wonderful spot - near the elevators, near the gym, near the ice machine. The staff was very helpful. They gave very good suggestions about where to go during my short stay. Sorry, did not stay long enough to have anymore experiences. The only thing I can say is that I was very, very comfortable."
"5434",5,"Nous avons passe une tres belle semaine a cette hotel, tres propre, personnel courtois, belle chambre il manque rien, 20 min. de la plage les dejeuner etait correcte."
"5435",5,"Calm environment, great breakfast, helpful staff."
"5436",5,"We were here for a three-day dance convention. We travel a lot, and this hotel was very excellent. The room was very clean and comfortable. The only complaint I have is the service in the restaurant was lacking. When I went for dinner, I had to pour my own glass of water and waited almost 20 minutes for a server to finally come to my table. Otherwise, the hotel was great."
"5437",5,"Very comfortable beds, fast internet, very quite and clean. Very satisfied with service and cleanliness. Convenient location and easy access right off interstate 95. Although I did not use the pool, it was very clean and inviting."
"5438",3,"Hotel is clean, staff is friendly. Breakfast may be a hit or miss, guess depends on who is preparing the food. Depending on where your room is located you can end up with considerable noise from the traffic on 1604. Third stay at this hotel, two good stays and last one is so so. Believe they changed management recently as... More"
"5439",3,"Got a king room for special rate. Had late flight in so unable to comment on evening snacks and drinks. Breakfast was good. Room was nice and clean, however, would not stay here if not for the special rate received."

It had a huge front room to it. I had 20 people in that room talking. They gave is a great price. Autumn Was... More"
"5441",2,"Upon check in our room was not ready. It was a non-smoking room, yet guests prior to us had been smoking inside the room. There was a cigarette butt in the corner of the room that house keeping missed. There was an inch between the outside door and the wall allowing bugs inside of the room. There were not enough wash cloths inside of the room for guests. The next morning my daughter fell in the bathroom in the lobby and hit her chin and hurt her wrist. The day of check out my daughter had hit her toe on the concrete car stop, causing us to go into the ER. The hotel overall was loud and dirty. Upkeep was poor. Poor lighting. We could have paid the same price for a hotel room at a Disney property!"
"5442",4,"Great room and nice to have complimentary breakfast and coffee/tea most of the day. Facilities were clean and well maintained. It is located in a nice quiet area of Post Falls but is somewhat removed from most of the dining and activities. It's only a short drive away so only a minor inconvenience. Overall it was a great stay and we would not hesitate to stay again!"
"5443",5,"Bad: No casino."
"5444",4,"Bad: No description of the complimentary shuttle service to universal. One shuttle per day leaves at 735 am. Would not have booked here had that been clear. Also when we arrived our booking clearly stated that we had two adults and two children. They gave us a room with a king bed. The hotel is not outside the gates of anything as the description stated also. Good: Breakfast was excellent"
"5445",4,"We chose Holiday Inn Express- Ashley River, because the rate was considerably lower than the hotels in the center of the historic district. While our choice meant we could not walk to the historic area, the free shuttle worked out well for us. The location was convenient for our visit (driving our own car) to the Magnolia Plantation and a dinner in Mount Pleasant. The hotel was was clean and our breakfast was great. Parking is free ... A bonus. Staff was friendly."
"5446",2,"I went into the dark room and the lights did nothing to brighten it up. Also when I drove up I thought the place was deserted and shut down. I turned around and left...even though I was losing over 100."
"5447",3,"Como otras veces en este hotel. Tranquila y comoda, a pesar de la lejania y largo viaje en metro. Caminar desde la ultima estacion de metro hasta el hotel, se hace agradable y cerca de alli hay lugares para comer. Si no te gusta caminar, tienen shuttle bus y vas y vienes en el. Diversidad de opciones de comida. El precio es una buena razon para esto. Es barato a pesar de la temporada."
"5448",3,"Front desk weren't well informed about payment - I usually pay when I check out but they wanted the cash up front before I was even finished checking in."
"5449",5,"Very nice place to stay. Friendly and very accommodating. Newly renovated rooms were great and very clean. We stay here almost every weekend during hunting season, always have geat service. The food in the restaurant is always good."
"5450",2,"When I first saw this motor inn, I thought there was now way I was staying at this place even though I had made reservations in advance. It needs a lot of repairs or maybe just rebuild the whole place. Everything looked very old and run down. The room itself was clean and comfortable and had all the necessary conveniences.... More"
"5451",5,"The stay was highly satisfactory. We were very impressed with Dan, who was managing the desk. There seemed to be some confusion about the category of room (we were allotted a room meant for handicapped person) but Dan straightened it out within a minute. He was also helpful with neighborhood information. Will stay there if we visit Newport again."
"5452",2,"The building looks beautiful the lobby too. They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms, 3 tvs and 2 baths! I was ecstatic at first. But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8. Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment!I lost count after that, but you get the idea. All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place."
"5453",3,"The hotel was not far from the beach and many other attractions."
"5454",5,"Bad: That I couldn't stay longer because of work. Good: All the lights and the view"
"5455",4,"I was very surprised at the location, it used to be Motel 6 ,I think, anyway, we always stay at the comfort suites so i was surprised when I arrived and it was right next door.

Sincerely,Jonathan"
"5462",4,"Very clean hotel, good breakfast, good value for your money. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars... the single bed rooms are small. I did not get a chance to use the pool, but pool room looked extremely clean as well."
"5463",4,"We booked this room last minute. The room was clean and bed comfortable. The staff were great. I asked for an extra pillow and the gave it to me, no questions asked. Next time we go to the area, we will book a room from them."
"5464",5,"This hotel has changed a bit in the lobby since that day in July 1981 when the skywalks collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring others.I was working at The Kansas City Star then and remember that disaster very well. The newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the Hyatt and the aftermath.I think it would be appropriate and in good taste for there to be a small plaque in the lobby noting the deaths and injuries of so many people and how building design has changed since.Today, the lobby looks quite safe, and I am sure it is. The Hyatt Regency disaster has gone down as one that has raised building safety to a much higher standard."
"5465",5,"Everything about this brand new Holiday Inn sparkles from the artistic reception area, to the inventively-furnished breakfast room, to the tasteful suites. All of the equipment is brand new and in great shape. Catch it before the inevitable aging process! Staff are very welcoming. Breakfast surprisingly good for a big chain hotel."

They were so understanding about getting us a room as close to a door on the first floor as possible. The rooms are clean with a fridge and a microwave in it. We are booked in February again for our road trip back to Las Angeles."

"5483",1,"We stayed July 11, 2005. Room 627. Room was in terrible shape: cigarette burns in the carpet, upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty. We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach. Sixth floor, no less. Called front desk: We're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room. Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party. I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer. I replied that I thought I was a customer too, only to be told: Have a nice night. Last time for us at a Drury."
"5484",5,"Bad: We had a really rude man greet us at the check in counter. When my dad didn't understand what he was asking he gave him such an attitude. Everything else was perfect except for that encounter."

"5487",2,"The public areas of this property are relatively well maintained, and the staff there are friendly and efficient. Oddities: 1. The layout of the room--The beds were very close to the door, so it was impossible to ignore the noise in the hallway that went on all night. 2. Housekeepers expected to clean the room while we were in it. 3. Hotel staff knocked on the door at 10pm, and insisted on entering the room to exchange a new phone book for the old one in the room, even though we told them the children were sleeping. Very strange."
"5488",5,"Great view, great pools, my girlfriend loved the full kitchen and the washer and dryer.. lots of families but the adult pool was quiet. Beach area was nice also . Loved our stay!!!!

"5496",4,"I stayed here for a couple of comp'd nights and had heard that the rooms were remodeled, so I was looking forward to it and had somewhat lofty expectations. I was admittedly impressed. The room was larger than expected, tastefully decorated, and had a great view of the golf course next door and the mountains beyond. It had a good-sized desk in the corner nearest the floor-to-ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair. The internet speed was decent, although I had to call support for connectivity assistance. Cox support got me online quickly. The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks, a large tub/shower, and roomy toilet area. The whole room was just great! The housekeeping staff was fantastic, getting me whatever I asked for quickly. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful, polite, and helpful! As for the casino, the sports book area was large and not overly busy. There was a limited amount of table games, but the common, basic ones were all there. The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh! If you're looking for a golf getaway place to stay, or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and don't want to spend a fortune,THIS IS IT! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games. Otherwise, it's 5+ stars all the way!"
"5497",4,"Palo Alto is an expensive area so finding someplace to stay that was reasonable was challenging. Comfort Inn offers a market-competitive value and a consistent stay.

A safeway was about 2 blocks away, (don't go to the Prospect Market--very expensive) The room was large enough for all six of us, the kitchen was adequate and saved us a lot of money. It was good we booked through hotels.com becasue we heard a few other customers fighting with the staff over their bill. When we checked out they said we were all paid and there was our reciept. The workout room was nice, the bathroom near the workout room hadn't been remodeled yet. There is internet but it didn't work very fast, they said they were updating it. No pay for view movies, but a nice big flat screened tv. Overall I would stay there again, loved the location and the fact it had a kitchen"

"5515",3,"We checked into this hotel on Saturday for one night. Check in was smooth and easy. We asked for a first floor room when we reserved. They only had an ADA room left which was fine with us. We travel with a lab and first floor is easier for her. The hotel was quite pet friendly but the dog walking area was limited and there was no bag and disposal station. The location is convenient and right off I10. The area is a little run down but I not to the point of feeling any safety issues. The room was comfortable and clean with the usual amenities. The air conditioner was hard to get on the right temperature. The was no wall temperature setting so you had to adjust it at the unit which was an older knob type. It took quite a while before we were not frozen out (which is better than the alternative in Phoenix). The hallway carpet was getting a little worn and could stand to be replaced. On to the breakfast. This was a pleasant surprise as it was better thsn the typical La Quinta breakfast. First of all there was real coffe, not an instant machine. There was also sausage links and multiple berry toppings for the waffles and whipped cream. I usually don't eat these things for breakfast but since they had them it was a nice treat. The cinnamon toast also looked inviting.Overall a good stay for one night. Given the lack of other things to do at that location I would not consider it for an extended stay."

Although this is not the closest hotel property to either, it is the best as far as hospitality and professionalism go. We arrived a bit before the posted check in and before too long, we were able to go to our room. I have to say the visit to the Towneplace Suites, Anaheim was made exceptional by the staff that works there, notably Adilene at the front desk. The smiling and professional service that she provided is what one would expect at a Ritz Carlton or St. Regis property.

"5527",5,"My family and I were surprised at just how good this place is. Given its location right in the heart of Seattle Center and its affordability, we thought for sure something was amiss. Parking in the area is expensive, here it is 25/day with full in/out privileges in a protected garage. The rooms are spacious, with a kitchen (microwave, stove, full fridge/freezer, sink, etc.) with an elevated dining table. Add the spacious bedroom, bathroom, and sitting area and you have a comfortable place for four to stay. The full breakfast is above average but the real hidden gem is the H Bar. We ate here a couple of times and the food is outstanding. The happy hour features a good selection of 3 local tap beers and the place is never really crowded. I'm not sure the tourists know they can come in otherwise I could imagine thirsty and hungry tourists at Seattle Center walking the minute or two to here, having a beer and a bite, and easily going right back to the Space Needle. I searched for the H Bar on Trip Advisor, but it's not there. NOTE TO HYATT HOUSE: You might consider getting the H Bar added as a restaurant if you want to increase your business.Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

Like..the rooms have a TASTE to them that isnt pleasant. I'm not talking about smoking rooms. My room was non-smoking, and it had that taste. I think it may be a product/room freshener or something that lingers. The furniture had sticky spots even after the room was cleaned, and I think its from that product. The smell gets all in your clothes, cigarettes..not good. Would I stay again Maybe. The pool was fun. The Asst Manager came to help me with an appliance issue, and while he did some things, he was supposed to come back and he never did. The pool was fun. There are all kinds of shopping and food around there. Wal-Mart/Golden Corral around the corner, good food right next door (mostly fried food though).

Like the other reviews here, the only issue here was hearing the train whistle. As I grew up close to a train crossing, hearing it didn't bother me but I could see how someone not used to it could be really shaken by the experience.Other than that, they offer a value-filled room with kitchenette, a well-equipped one at that. Similar to Residence Inn properties, there's a fridge, dishwasher, sink, and stove along with some basic cookware and utensils. This property even had a food disposal unit.As much as there was a bed, living area, bathroom, kitchenette, and work desk, there really wasn't much place to sit down and eat for more than one person. I suppose a group of people could eat in the living area but I wouldn't find it all that comfortable.The services available in the lobby were fantastic, there a computer with free internet AND free printing (although there's a 30-minute time limit to be fair to other guests).

"5570",5,"We travel to Santa Barbara several times a year to see family. This place was fabulous. Reasonable for Santa Barbara, great service, lovely place close to State St. and everything, and the little restaurant was FABULOUS. Darned if I didn't have the best eggs benedict ever. Not kidding. Ever. With arugala. And the nicest part was it was included with... More"
"5571",4,"We spent one night here on our way to Los Angeles. It was a nice place, very clean and modern. Neighborhood is OK - right near freeway and fast food. Not quite what I was expecting. Complimentary breakfast is the standard fare. Would recommend."
"5572",4,"Hotel was perfect for a 5 day family getaway. Location, Location, Location on the Intercoastal and Riverwalk. Breakfast was very good and more than adequate for families. The staff was friendly and helpful. We plan to return next time we are in the area."
"5573",4,"It was just an over night stay but we both loved the area and the town of Golden and will definitely go back and would for sure stay at Table Mountain Inn......."
"5574",3,"Good: Good hotel at Fremont street. But do not expect something special. Relatively old rooms, no WIFI in the rooms, but the bed was comfortable, the staff was nice, and the Hotel is direct in the heart of Old Las Vegas."

"5578",3,"It is hard for me to review an oceanfront hotel. I go for the ocean and not necessarily the hotel. While this place is definitely far above average, there are just a couple of things that need mentioning. Firat the good. Very very accomodating. The staff was versatile and seemed eager to please. Our room was very clean and modern... More"
"5579",3,"It wasn't our first time at this motel. We like it because it is in a good centrally located spot and is reasonably priced. They have added a complimentary breakfast room since our last time there. The staff is nice. The facility for the most part is in good shape for its age. The only thing I didn't like was that the mattresses are too soft for my back. When we return to Gatlinburg again we will try to stay there again and hope for a new firmer mattress."
"5580",3,"My wife and a number of her co-workers were staying here for 2 weeks while working at the nearby convention center, I decided to tag along for 5 nights. The rooms come equipped with a small kitchen which is good for extended stays, however you would need a car as there is no grocery store within walking distance. The hotel is about a mile from Disneyland and the convention center, but is reight beside Angels Stadium and has some decent restaurants within walking distance. The biggest issue I had with the hotel is the noise from the trains passing by as the rail line is directly behind the hotel. The temperature was very comfortable in the evening so we left the windows open, big mistake. I was awakened at 4.30am by a train going through with its horn blaring, if you've seen My Cousin Vinnie it was pretty much like that. Having traveled from the east coast I was then wide awake. Trains start coming through on a regular basis after that, pretty much every 1/2 hour or hour. A number of people in our group had the same issues and resorted to Ambien to try and sleep through."
"5581",5,"Bad: I loved everything. The parking, the restaurant ,the rooms and the the several acts that perform every night in the downtown area. Good: The people at the front desk were superb. They upgraded me to a real nice room."
"5582",2,"The staff were delightful and most helpful, with special mention of the front desk! Check-in was a struggle for the staff - quite a few people arrived at the same time. Fortunately for us we were related or attending the same event and were not frustrated or anxious, but there was one person at the front desk. It was unfortunate... More"
"5583",3,"Bad: Our toilet overflowed at 1am and the water wouldn't stop. When we tried to call reception the phone didn't work. My husband went down to reception whilst I packed our clothes as I naturally assumed we would be given another room. He returned with a maintenance employee and a housekeeping employee. They refused to give us another room (so we could go back to sleep!) instead keeping us awake until 2am whilst they sorted out the problem, extracted the water from the floor (the bathroom was flooded), mopped the floor and brought fresh towels. Good: The reception staff were very friendly. A bottle of sparkling was sent to our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary upon our arrival. That was a really nice touch."
"5584",5,"We were delayed one day due to bad weather and the staff understood completely. This hotel is top quality in every way. The room and breakfast are both terrific. The breakfast included fresh fruit as well as usual favorites."
"5585",3,"Bad: In my opinion, the carpet needs to be replaced or cleaned urgently. It left an unpleasant musty smell in the room. I changed the room and the smell remained. After walking barefoot on the carpet and stepping into the tub, there were black dirt tracks in the tub. I expected the rooms to be as good as the standard of the lobby, the dining area and the pool area. Good: Excellent breakfast. The outside facilities, lobby and the pool area are very good."
"5586",5,"Excellent service from friendly and efficient staff. Sparkling clean room (a little on the small side, but very nice). Enjoyed the Route 66 theme, and photo opp with car out front.

I have a handicap and was put on the 2nd floor about 11-12 rooms away from the elevator. No luggage carts available which made it difficult for me to bring up my belongings. I would NOT recommend this Super 8 even though it was close to all we wanted to see in the Dayton area."

The hotel was lovely and clean, and our room was comfortable and accomodating. The free hot breakfast was an unexpected bonus! Quality Inn Tarpon Springs is certainly a budget-friendly, conveniently-located hotel, and it totally exceeded our expectations!

"5630",5,"We stayed in double queen. It was very spacious. The neighborhood was great. Felt very comfortable there. It's a nonresidential area by the freeway with restaurants nearby. The freeway was a little loud in the mornings and there was some construction going on right outside the hotel. They should be done with the construction there in about a week. It woke us up very early one morning. I told the manager about it and he was happy to switch our rooms if we wanted. We chose to stay in the same room. It was less noisy the next morning without the jackhammer going. The kids even enjoyed watching the big excavator going. The even numbered rooms may be less noisy. Breakfast was decent. Scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, cereal, and donuts. The indoor pool is small. It would maybe fit 15-20 people. There were 12 people when we went and was already getting crowded. Exercise room has an elliptical and recumbent bike only. The staff were very nice. We would stay there again."

"5641",3,"Bad: The day shift wouldn't believe me that something was wrong with the room door lock and made me re-key. Then, they sent the cleaning staff to 'open my door for me' only to discover that the electronic key system won't work if the batteries in the lock haven't been replaced. Lastly, I never could figure out how to make the steam shower work, but after the episode with the door I decided it wasn't worth asking. Good: The night shift desk was helpful and once she realized she'd made a mistake, she went about solving the problem as quickly as she could. I was still locked out of my room for 30 to 45 minutes."
"5642",2,"Well, I'm stayed in much better motels and some worse, though I made do with this one. First off they put me in a room that had not been serviced since the last guest. Walked in and like wow, is someone in here! Obviously they were long gone but not a good feeling. Called the front desk and they put me in another room. My new room seemed clean, though motel in general is a little run down. Motel itself is actually 3 separate buildings and I was in the south one. Area is fine and I felt safe walking around outside at night. Couple of real good honky tonks right next door (recommend Nashville Palace), though down side if you want peace and quiet you won't get it until they close up at around 2am. The outside pool is across the parking lot right up beside a Bar and Grill (Scoreboard - another fine honky tonk), though not like I was going to partake in outside pool in January anyway though is strange where the pool is located. By far the best about this motel is the location. Everything you need is within walking distance. All in all it was okay though not sure I would take family to stay there, though good for just me and would stay there again. All depends on your level of expectations, if they are low to average, you should be fine, if high, go somewhere else. Get what you pay for."
"5643",5,"Bad: The bed was too soft for my mate and we need more pillows. They were happy to provide the additional pillows. Good: The entire staff was very nice. The room was clean and we stayed on the north-side and did not hear any noise from Fremont Street."

"5675",4,"I really enjoyed my stay at The River Hotel! It had a great location. Our room overlooked the Chicago River and we were directly across from Trump Tower. Very cool. The hotel was also within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do (Millenium Park, Shedd aquarium, the Field Museum, Magnificent Mile, food, etc.). One of my favorite features of the hotel was the free bottles of water. It was nice to grab a bottle and fill it up before heading out for the day. I will definitely be recommending this hotel to any friends traveling to Chicago!"

"5684",5,"Great new and clean hotel. Staff is friendly and location is perfect. The only negative is the valet charge of 32/day. I thought that was excessive. I am not sure what the self park cost is since I arrived after midnight and just wanted to go to sleep once I got there."
"5685",5,"The staff was helpful, even to repair a flashing light on fire alarm. The rooms were clean and spacious. Loved the door between bedroom and sitting room. There are restaurants in walking distance, which means you don't have to drive to get a meal. Breakfast was nice! I recommend this, especially the price."
"5686",5,"Our room was spacious enough for 4. Even with our very late arrival, the front desk person was friendly and gave us a good room. The breakfast was the best so far on the trip, with cold and hot options, like scrambled eggs and sausage. A nice find along the way."

The staff is very friendly and the lobby was beautiful decorate and the lobby was beautiful decorated for Christmas."
"5689",4,"Stayed here with a few friends for a weekend getaway. Nice bar/lounge in the lobby area with a decent sized commissary with snacks and drinks for sale. The rooms were nice and new. We watched some of the NCAA games in our room and the tv was a bit smaller than I would like but it was still a good picture. The location is probably the best part. Its about 3 blocks from Bourbon St which means its a short walk but far enough away not to be impacted by the noise. There still is some construction going on and the pool will not be completed until May, but overall, still a very solid stay.It's always great to hear that we have another satisfied guest! It seems to be a consensus that our location is key to having access to all that New Orleans has to offer yet far enough away to relax peacefully. Thanks, Kristi"

"5692",3,"We had a good stay at the Lincoln Plaza Hotel. The hotel decor is a bit outdated, so it was kind of like stepping back into the 1980's. But everything else was just fine about our stay. The check-in process was quick and easy. The staff was friendly. Our room was clean and comfortable. There is a refrigerator in the room for keeping items chilled. There was a coffee maker, as well, with both tea and coffee. The bathroom was small, but everything worked just fine. We needed extra towels and a visit to the front desk to ask for them had the towels delivered to our room in about five minutes. The hotel is located in the middle of Monterey Park, which is a majority Asian populated city. If you have an issue with being served by Asian staff, surrounded by Asian guests, and having people in your hotel speak a different language with each other when they are not speaking with you, then you might have issues staying at this hotel. But if you would like a clean, comfortable, budget-friendly place to stay when in the Los Angeles Area, the Lincoln Plaza Hotel should work nicely for you."

The food area was also a mess. The rooms are not in very good repair - some mold damage along the ceiling in both the bedroom and bathroom. They have changed to cotton bed covers that can be washed rather than polyester so that's an improvement. Overall this hotel is fair."

The actual room itself had a very conveniently mounted TV so high marks for that, but beyond that there was nothing indicative of the price point. The sheets, pillows, and bed were mediocre at best. Also the room had the same, if not cheaper, in-room AC unit as a Townplace Inn I stayed at as well. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, but that doesn't justify the price. Also, they provided 0 benefits as a Expedia VIP member. Definitely would not stay here again. I'd either price down and stay somewhere else, or go a little bit higher to a 5-star."

The room itself was pretty big but the beds were small (they were full-sized beds), what hotel still has those It's usually queen or king. With that being said, we were kind of uncomfortable sleeping two to a bed. The room itself didn't get that cool as the air only circulated in the area where the air conditioning was and didn't seem to distribute throughout the entire room.On a positive note, the night clerk, I believe his name was Mahadi was extremely accommodating and attentive and we as a group appreciated that."

"5778",5,"We drove up to Sedona in the wee hours of the night. Awoke to the beautiful scenery! This hotel is clean and well taken care of. The continental breakfast isn't mind blowing but has the basics. For the price and convenience, it can't be beat."
"5779",2,"This hotel is in need of a massive update.

Great restaurant that just opened! And very nice condo/suite that was comfortable and nicely furnished. THAT said...here is the bad! The housekeeping is terrible, and maintenance is sorely lacking!

"5784",5,"Good: Courteous and helpful staff! Excellent location. Close to prudential and shopping. Highly recommend"
"5785",3,"Basically a nice hotel but service leaves a lot to be desired . For the money you pay these things should not be a problem. We were given coupons for a free breakfast and free drink but as compensation I'd rather have things go the way they are supposed to."
"5786",5,"Bad: f b facilities not open. Good: everything"
"5787",5,"The location of the hotel was great. It was just a short drive to turner field and right across the street from the aquarium and the coke museum.

"5789",5,"The room was very nice, the A/C was phenominal in the room, a quiet and pleasant stay. The staff was very nice. The only downside of the stay was the internet cut in and out through the day. Overall, great experience!"
"5790",5,"Good: The free continental breakfast is beyond our expectation and saved us lots of hassle in the morning. Our whole family loved it."
"5791",4,"So, I met my Valentine at the Greyhound Bus station in downtown Pittsburgh, Pa. I was coming back from Cleveland, Ohio. She was on her way to Buffalo, New York.

"5792",4,"Location. Difficult to find a bellhop to assist with luggage."
"5793",2,"This hotel looks new and appears to have been newly updated. The breakfast area is very nice and has a homey feeling yet has a very contemporary style. The service at the front desk was speedy and very professional awesome reception with the friendliest staff. The rooms layout is very traditional going back to the older times. Even with some signs of upgrades, it felt to be a very old room. I think the dcor needed to be better and the appliances upgraded. The first thing I spotted entering the room was the throw pillow on the bed with what appears to be a large oil stain (hoping it is oil or grease) in the smack center of the pillow facing right at you. That sight alone made me think that the rooms upkeep was not up to par. I cannot understand why the pillow was even left for display in the room. The bathroom did not have a fan, showering in it created a very steamy room that made the rooms mirrors useless. Water pressure was awesome and the fixtures are all brand new. There was no complimentary bottled water in the room. There is no vending machine in the hotel however, there are candies for sale prominently displayed in the main lobby. The breakfast offered was good and plentiful. As I was getting ready for a biscuit, the lady refilling the biscuit tray rearranged the biscuits with her BARE hands and then with her BARE hands placed new biscuits into the tray. After seeing it, I changed my mind about having the biscuit."

"5811",5,"One of the most enjoyable stays. Everything was excellent."
"5812",5,"Another pleasant stay at Aria. Ask for a room on a high floor if you want a view. Our rooms were on the 4th floor and all we could see was a/c equipment. Brick oven pizza was delicious and buffet filing."

"5814",5,"My stay here was awesome. Stayed here to break up my journey and got a good night's rest. Really friendly staff."

This hotel did pay attention to our special requests, which rarely happens and sometimes those little things make a BIG difference. We didn't try the breakfast but we will next time we stay here."
"5821",5,"Perfect location to get to merriweather, tons of food options across the street. Staff was helpful."
"5822",4,"Great location (downtown, access to bus and Metro, shops, restaurants), Very good and friendly service, general comfort, I did benefit from a special price offer due to low attendance i guess.A few little things to be improved to me are the waiting time (up or down) at the elevator - one elevator only for the upper floors - Insulation in the room (Air, street noise) could be better too. But overall a good experience."
"5823",5,"We stayed only 1 night having a very late flight. The staff was extremely helpful. Our room was very nice and comfortable. Breakfast was really good. Lots of free parking. Great location. Would stay again."
"5824",4,"Great location. We had always stayed in Pigeon Forge and traveled to Gatlinburg. We decided to stay in Gatlinburg and walk to the sights. What a great time we had. This hotel is located a block from the Aquarium and within walking distance to EVERYTHING! We will definitely stay again :-)"
"5825",4,"My family and I stayed at the Comfort Suites and had a great stay. The staff had a great attitude towards everyone who stayed. My family and I were treated great and were well taken care of. I recommend the Comfort Suites to anyone staying for a long period of time or for a night."

"5829",4,"Nice big room. Was difficult to get to at first but overall a good start."
"5830",4,"Bad: The restaurant was closed for the day when we arrived so we had to go out yo eat and the free happy hour that I'd read about had been discontinued. That was particularly disappointing as that was one of the factors I looked at when choosing a hotel. Also, the view we had was the parking lot, not the city view I expected. Good: The bed was very comfortable, what I'd expect from a Westin."
"5831",5,"My friends and I stay in TC every year for Girl's Weekend and love that the pool is 24 hours. Highly recommended to anyone that needs a room. Clean with a great breakfast!"
"5832",5,"Clean well-furnished room with good amenities including minifridge and microwave. Fitness room with up-to-date equipment. Nice indoor pool with whirlpool hot tub. I was pleased to see there was a lift to help someone with mobility problems get into/ out of pool. Staff was pleasant and professional."
"5833",3,"Room was very clean, staff was friendly, continental breakfast included. Did not have any extra outlets for charging electronic devices. This may be resolved as the staff took our advice to install an outlet extender that was screwed in so it could not be taken from the room. Overall a nice stay for the price."
"5834",2,"We have a 3rd floor room Mountain Side View facing Ala Wai Blvd. The Blvd. Creates noise constantly 24/7 with loud music, loud motorcycles and cars because it is a very busy street.

"5837",4,"Bad: Why didn't I know about Kinzie West That is what you show in your ads, but I got only the highest floor of the Unwest Kinzie. I was expecting a better view of the city."
"5838",5,"My family and I stayed here for a night, the front desk guy and girl that were there are super nice they treated us with a warm smile and made us feel at home! .

"5840",5,"We really loved this place. It's beautiful. The grounds look great. The rooms are spacious and very well kept. We would definitely stay again. We had a three bedroom unit, and they were all wonderful."
"5841",1,"We arrived for our first family vacation only to find out they lost our reservation. I had the print out of our hotel confirmation but that made no difference. Staff was friendly but not helpful in finding us new accomodations."
"5842",5,"This appeared to be a brand new hotel. It is extremely clean, bright and modern. They have a guest laundry on the 3rd floor that you can do yourelf. It costs 1.50 to wash and also to dry. The only complaint I had about that was there was no change machine in the laundry room, so I had to make a trip downstairs for that. They have a computer off the lobby where you can easily get on the internet for free. That was great to check emails, print out maps, etc. The breakfast there is included but ends at 9 a.m., which for vacationing families seemed very early. The breakfast was OK, but the same every day. The lobby is great, (you actually eat breakfast in the lobby area.) The workout room was very nice. It was large and actually had free weights, not just the usual treadmill. My son and I swam in the indoor pool one night and were the only ones in it. When you first walk in the pool area, it feels like a sauna, but is very nice to feel when you get out soaking wet. The location is right off 264, and it took us only about 10 minutes to get downtown and the same to get to the beach. There are really no restaurants real close by except for Ruby Tuesdays which is basically in the parking lot. You can walk there. The rooms are huge, plenty of room for a family to spread out. The furnishings are very pretty (artwork, lamps, curtains). They have music playing in the hallways near the elevators (which are very large as well.) Overall, this place was great."
"5843",2,"The hotel is safe and basic. The good points are the hot tub. The rooms are old and need remodeled. They have the basic dark walls and dark bedspread and really old bathroom.

"5849",4,"Its far from DC. but hotel is good. Sorrounding also is good, lots of eating places nearby. Room was big and worth its price. But AC was not too cool. Hotel should provide a fridge in the room. My kid picked up a wafer which she put it back. But I find they charged me for that from my credit card statement. They did not even confirm from me. I had to lodge a complaint and they reverted back the amount."
"5850",5,"This is a clean hotel. The rooms are well kept and tidy. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The free breakfast has many options such as waffles, eggs, sausage etc. The hotel is centrally located near area restaurants and the local shopping mall. A great place to stay in the Elmira Horseheads area."
"5851",5,"The property is very attractive inside and out. When the sun came out I noticed flower baskets hanging under the staircase on the main building and some trumpet vine, and fuchsias blooming on the hillside.

"5858",5,"We were extremely pleased and surprised with our stay at this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and went out of the way to make our stay comfortable. There was a lifeguard at the pool and 2 computers in the lobby with internet access that we could use anytime we wanted, which we never expected. There was a full breakfast every morning which was superb! There was a shuttle to the Metro that ran from 7am-10pm and anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel, but you had to be prepared to wait. The hotel is walking distance to Springfield Mall and restaurants. Don't rent a car to go to WA DC as the Metro will get you within walking distance of the major attractions, saving you time and money. If we go back to DC we will stay there again."

"5860",5,"Will definitely return as this suite had everything I needed and more!"
"5861",4,"Good, quiet location. Away from the shops but still in the heart of it all. Within walking distance of everything including Grand Canyon railway. The usual noise from neighbors -- running water, doors closing and mumbled voices through the walls. I'd stay here again."
"5862",5,"We only had 2 wash rags and there were 3 occupants. The faucet on the shower was loose, so we had to be careful. The room itself was clean and was very cozy, especially since I was traveling with 2 small children. We will definitely stay there again."
"5863",4,"20 Extra charge for King bed, 10 charge for a microwave in the room, but couldn't put it in because maintenance wasn't on site. The room was decent and clean. The staff was friendly enough. Another guest with body odor permeated the lobby with her essence and it was quickly addressed. Location is very convenient and the price was reasonable. We missed breakfast, so I cannot provide feedback on that."
"5864",5,"Awesome hotel. Virgin really took the time to figure out all things at are frustrating about staying in a hotel and fixed them - kudos!!! The hotel will become a regular haunt in the future. From free wifi, free cocktails, a mini bar you're not terrified to touch, not to mention the no check out time, they really are way ahead of the rest.

"5866",3,"Be aware that this hotel is currently being renovated. My room itself was OK, though the bathroom didnt seem like the renovation was finished. Poorly installed sockets and a cracked shower unit. The peephole on the door wasnt complete and had a Kleenex stuffed in it. I assume the construction also affected the breakfast, which was way below the style I expect at a La Quinta. Rate was too high for the level of room and breakfast provided. Dear Traveler, Thank you for taking the time to post a review on behalf of your stay with. We apologize that some of the renovations were taking place during your stay. It is through your feedback that we are able to improve what we do. It is our hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W."
"5867",2,"Very worm out room, close to the airport, but the smell in the room was unpleasant"
"5868",5,"Bad: A little sticker shock with 65/night valet parking, but I hadn't done my research for cheaper options, so not a big deal. Good: Super hip and definitely a young techy vibe, but everyone was friendly and helpful. Room was as described and very spacious for the location and price. Even though it is right at the corner of the L Tracks, sound wasn't a problem. Exactly what was needed!"

The location is great, you can walk to some shops and eateries. It is a short drive or bike ride to the beach which is nice. Our first room had a faulty air conditioner and the room was super musty. That being said, the hotel staff was GREAT and got us another room. They continued to be really helpful and friendly throughout the stay. The room was really tight for a 5 night stay and I'd only recommend this for 1 maybe 2 nights tops. The pool was clean and the free breakfast was so/so.

"5889",3,"We stayed here for a trip to Disneyland. The good: 1 bedroom suite was very large. The bedroom area was small but the living area was huge. Great working/desk area and very nice kitchenette with a nearly full sized refrigerator, small stove, microwave, etc. Some things were recently renovated and looked very nice. The staff was great, helpful and friendly. Location was great, lots of stuff nearby, on the ART route to Disney and close to freeways. Breakfast was small but a decent selection - the waffles were really good and they had trays so that you could take food back to your room. The bad: some parts of the hotel have not been renovated, so there is a mix of new/nice and old/run down in the same room (i.e bathroom counters were nice, but the rest of the bathroom was dated. Old dresser in the bedroom, but tv's were nicer. The carpeting was old, and the door to the room was worn and actually had some non matching paint spots covering some type of damage, but the kitchenette was very nice as was the desk area and newer cabinets that were part of the desk area. For having a large living space, there wasn't a lot of seating. So, there was a small sofabed, and a table with just one chair. It would be nice to have the table and 4 chairs so that if multiple people are in the room (a standard family) there would be places to sit as the couch would only really fit 2-3 people. the other bad was that while I booked the room using Marriott points and was told that they would only place a 40 hold for incidentals on my credit card, the system automatically puts a hold for 170 for each night of your stay, unless the clerk removes your card info and overrides the system. I didn't know this until i looked online at my credit card account. Fortunately, Sam at the front desk was great and got the hold for the first night removed and made sure that no hold was placed on the 2nd night. Still though, unsettling to have some unexpected holds on your account. I've never had that happen at any other marriott property. I also had trouble connecting to the wifi, it kept giving me an error that I couldn't log into the wifi with my room number and last name. But, it actually still connected me on all devices I tried, so I just ignored the error and it worked just fine.Martha C.Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate.

"5890",3,"A very old hotel with old smelling bath tower and bedding fixtures refrigerator is only available upon request but came with broken temperature setting control knob and old floor carpet was not very cleanly vacuumed. The A/C works but noisy it would better be turned off if you preferred to have a quite sleep. The Complimentary breakfast is very good."
"5891",4,"Stayed one night for a paintball event in the area. The room was clean. The bed and pillows were comfortable. Max and Ermas was right next door. Rested well. The staff was friendly and attentive. Nice selection of items on the complementary breakfast bar."
"5892",5,"This Drury is AWESOME! The staff is super friendly and attentive. Could not ask for more in terms of the food, breakfast and the 5:30 Kickback (especially the mac and cheese, mmmmm). Location is convenient to restaurants (several within walking distance) and shopping. I have to go to the local hospital for work and the Drury is within 5 miles... More"

We used Marriott app to confirm the hotel. The room keys were ready by 2PM as we specified. The room size is kind of small compared to other Springhill suite. And... More"
"5897",5,"My wife and I stayed feb 13-14 for our 31st wedding anniversary. Had a very enjoyable stay. Close to everything. Rooms were very clean and the bed was comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. If youre looking for a good place to stay I highly recommend twin islands."

"5900",2,"Building and furniture old and worn. Looks scary from the street. Nothing matches. New mattress on bed and room was clean, even the a.c. filters (i always check). Ok if you are a guy just looking to sleep somewhere cheap."

"5902",5,"Great"
"5903",5,"Bad: Parking was expensive at 62 for 1 night, and o thought it was included but it wasn't. Good: Location was near sightseeing."
"5904",5,"The Mills House is centrally located in the middle of everything we wanted to do during our stay. The staff members were the friendlist I have ever met. The rooms were great. The only down side was the pictures posted were true to the appearance of the hotel, but not the rooms. The rooms were a little more modern than pictured, this did not take away from our enjoyment though. We were on the 5th floor and had a great view. I would stay here again on another visit."
"5905",5,"Before coming to Tahoe and reading the reviews for this hotel, I was skeptical to give this place a try. The reviews said the place was very old and needing of remodeling.

"5907",5,"great."
"5908",4,"Bad: Rooms not ready when they said they were. Walls too thin and so it was noisy,. Could not get hot water in shower and the elevator broke. Also no corkscrew or cheese cutter which should be included. Good: The units were modern and well cared for. The price was good for the location. The layout of the unit was good. The staff was pleasant and I am sure would help if needed."

"5911",4,"Perfect for a group of baseball boys. The staff was very friendly. The breakfast selection was the only thing that could improve but wasn't that big of a deal. Location was good for the boys to walk to fast food away from trafficWe are very happy to hear that our location was ideal for your team. We appreciate your business and hope to host your team again in the future."
"5912",4,"We were in town visiting family--we booked our room online which is so convenient. This motel is very clean with friendly staff. Our room was very quiet--complimentary snacks were out upon our arrival. We would not hesitate to stay here again."
"5913",5,"I look for cleanliness when I stay at a hotel. I have no complaints. The room was clean with nice furniture, the bed was so comfortable. All of the staff were friendly and professional with smiles on their faces."
"5914",5,"We have stayed at the Warner many times. Always clean, very helpful staff and right in downtown West Chester, close to everything. Limited parking on site but discount parking available near by. Lots of nice shops and restaurants , just walk out the front door. They tend to fill up fast so book early."
"5915",5,"This was an excellent hotel to visit! The customer service was some of the best I've received, and I travel all year. I will be staying here every time I return to the Charlotte area. Despite the busy weekend, this hotel still felt like my home away from home."

"5918",5,"Bad: Losing money lol. Good: I like the attitude and service from the staff...i enjoy the atmosphere and the food"
"5919",3,"Our stay was okay. The room wasn't too bad. Bed was kind of uncomfortable and door frame had a gap into the hallway so we got to hear everyone's conversation that walked down the hall. if someone had wanted to look.in they could have!"
"5920",5,"The service in this hotel is excellent. The rooms were lovely, clean and spacious. The bathroom was fab -- had good lighting and lots of space. The lobby/bar/pool area is chic and made a great, not too loud place to meet friends each night I was there. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful -- truly the best hotel I have stayed at in a long time."
"5921",4,"I really enjoyed my stay the bed was comfortable and All the staff was courteous. The pool area although small was just the right temperture and a really clean area. I felt safe and comfortable during my short stay."

"5923",5,"The Best Western Inn at the Vines is conveniently located to the main entrance of the Napa Valley right near across the street walking distance to multiple places for shopping, entertainment, gas and dining. I had an easy relaxing time at this Hotel. The hotel staff were friendly informative and always helpful with my questions. The room was modern, clean and quiet. There was also a restaurant on site with a discount for hotel guests. I really enjoyed my stay and plan to return on my next trip to the Napa Valley.Shawn R - Thank you for your kind review.

"5927",5,"Everyone was so friendly, the breakfast buffet was great, not your average free breakfast! Will most defiantly be staying there when I return in June. There was nothing to complain about at all, and I am pretty sure if you had a complaint it would be fixed ASAP!!"
"5928",3,"The room was spacious. The bed, however was hard and uncomfortable as well as the air conditioner being very noisy. The breakfast was almost nonexistant. It was nice to have a service that took you back and forth to the airport."
"5929",5,"Bad: Shower exposed to room. Good: The room was quiet and private."
"5930",4,"This Hotel was wonderful. I booked this stay online which was simple to do, was checked in by a friendly staff. The room was amazing and the best I have ever stayed in, very clean and neat, beds were comfortable, price was great, and the breakfast in the morning was filling and good. I didn't get to use the pool... More"
"5931",4,"We live 30 minutes from the Hotel. We wanted to spend the night downtown and see the fireworks. My wife and I stayed over the 4th of July weekend. The location was great, near the park and Peace Center. Many restaurants near by. We ate at the Nose Dive, under the hotel. Had burgers and beer. The room was disappointing because it was so damp from the humidity. The AC was cool enough, just too damp."
"5932",4,"Clean, comfortable and complimentary breakfast. Staff was very good and no surprises. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
"5933",5,"We decided to try Viceroy Santa Monica after staying at Viceroy Abu Dhabi and enjoying it so much. The hotel is set a street or two back from the beach which was fine but we had an ocean view room which made up for it. There may be some traffic noise if you're staying on the lower floors but we...

"5936",3,"Bad: Food, buffet was good but limited variety. Good: Convenient location and free parking"
"5937",2,"This place was loud and had the most awkward set up. It made it very difficult to rest. Disney on 4 hours of sleep kinda sucks. The place was pretty clean."
"5938",4,"We didn't get to take advantage of the outdoor amenities because it was so cold all weekend. The kids definitely want to go again when it is warm. Very friendly and helpful staff! Great location out of the way of the congestion."
"5939",1,"Dreadful place to stay. Beyond belief that they can charge such an exorbitant rate for such inferior accommodation. We arrived late after an exhausting journey and just needed some sleep. Some hope. Dirty room, did not want to walk round without shoes on. Could not bring ourselves to sit on the sofa. Curtains were hanging off the tracks so barely... More"
"5940",4,"Bad: The valet parking was the worst at one time waited 45 min then 30 min for my vehicle to arrive. Twice the excuse given was the ticket inside vehicle was wrong."
"5941",5,"Bad: Every now and again, we could hear bass from another room. However, it was never during sleeping hours so that was positive. Good: Everyone was super friendly and helpful. All staff were very accommodating and friendly. The rooms (especially their view) were very nice. The rain shower was a definite plus as well."
"5942",4,"Stayed at Aria for 3 nights in a King Bedroom. Room decor was modern and comfortable. Bed was very nice and comfy. Automated switches and controls for everything.

"5945",1,"We stayed here on our way out to a Midwest trip and it was very unsatisfactory. The pillows were down, which I am extremely allergic to. I tried calling the guest service who didn't answer, twice. Went down physically and they didn't have any allergy free pillows available for use. Recommended that I use bundled up towels to sleep on. The room smelled very bad when we arrived. The only redeeming factor was they had a nice pool / hot tub."
"5946",5,"We had a great time in Charleston. The location of the Mills House was ideal. We parked our car and walked to all the attractions for the next 3 days. We needed the car once and it was brought to us in a timely manner. The staff was courteous and helpful. We were spoiled by everyone. Looking forward to staying at the Mills House again."
"5947",5,"Travelling via Portland we decided to stay at the Benson as 'somewhere different' from the usual run of chain hotels. We were enchanted by the old world charm of this 100-year old restored hostelry and the delightful ambience of another era free from the rush and stress of the modern world. The hotel itself has been beautifully restored. It is... More"
"5948",4,"My tv wouldn't work due to no signal but everything else was great. Room was very comfortable and very clean. Complimentry breakfast was delicious and had more items than expected. Pool and fitness rooms were clean and nice"
"5949",5,"Well, they did it again. After a stay at this hotel back in August and the absolutely fabulous service from Erin Loughlin, I kept my promise of never staying anywhere else when I visit Chicago. And, because I love the great city of Chicago, I had to go back. This time, I had no question where my lodging would be as I trekked to and fro across the city streets. I LOVE the personal service. I have told so many people about my great experiences and I hope they choose to patronize this great hotel, too. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I'll be back!"
"5950",5,"Amazing hotel! Great location! Starbucks and lots of restaurants were right down the road. The hotel has been newly renovated so everything is nice and new. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The only thing I didn't like was that housekeeping came by at 9am. A little too early in my opinion. But overall I give this place 5 stars!"
"5951",5,"My stay at Comfort Suites was very relaxing. They have every amenity that you could think of. They had an excellent hot breakfast every morning, a heated pool, and a fitness room. I would recommend this hotel to anyone because they are very understanding of your wants and needs. They will try their best to get you what you need."
"5952",4,"My husband and I stayed here while driving from Florida to Boston for a move. It was our first stay at a Drury Inn, and compared to comparably priced hotels, I thought it was really nice. The room was spacious and comfortable, clean and quiet. Breakfast was typical of similar chains. My only complaint--as a tea drinker, I was very... More"
"5953",5,"Bad: Better breakfast selection. Nothing available for us since we are on a low carb diet like eggs or sausage/bacon. Good: Location to theatre."
"5954",3,"Bad: The staff were not professional. The reception staff who helped me checking in was dressed like being at home. She looked very tired and communicated with me without any expression on her face. My bathroom was a disaster. It became a swimming pool after I used it each time. BTW, the real swimming pool was closed for the seasonal reason. Good: The staff were helpful. The bed is comfortable. The location is just in the very center of the main tourism avenue."
"5955",4,"Small no frills historic hotel close to many bars restaurants and the beach in a quiet location Clean but small rooms, parking beside the hotel. Great staff and great service. I would recommend this place for a more personal touch than the big hotels nearby"
"5956",4,"This hotel was perfect for us. We went to DC for a conference but went a few days early to play. The hotel has a shuttle that leaves every hour and takes you to the metro. We got around perfectly from there. The room smelled like it used to be a smoking room and they've been trying to cover it up for a few months but it was livable. The pool was a little creepy and cold at night but that didn't stop us from swimming every night. All in all a great place for the money."
"5957",5,"I stayed at the hotel while attending the Harvard LEV program. The room was luxurious, spacious and had all the comforts needed for this busy week. Wifi was a little inconsistent, but not too challenging. I would definitely stay again the next time I'm in Cambridge."
"5958",4,"You have to be prepared for anything at a hotel within this price range, but I was surprised to find that it was clean and decently maintained. The price was right for me, so I think overall it was worth it. I stayed there on a Friday night and didn't notice any loud people or drunks in the area."
"5959",5,"We arrived in the Columbus area very late in the evening/early morning without a reservation thinking we would be able to find a room. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Most hotels were booked around the major interstate area. The Four Points held a room for us at their standard rate, upon arrival we let them know that we were... More"
"5960",5,"Good: staff was very friendly and accommodating, hotel perfectly located for travelers"
"5961",4,"Good: Location to Camden Yards, Inner Harbor and light rail stop."
"5962",3,"The breakfast bar was wonderful, so many choices. The location was pretty good and they provide shuttle to Metro. The room was not great. The bathroom was clean, the beds were on the small side. The rest of the room seemed a bit outdated (but fine by me for the price). BIG DOWNFALL. Gum on two areas of the headboard. I do not know who puts gum on the top and side of the headboard, but I am more disturbed housekeeping did not see it to clean it up. Overall for the price compared to others it was pretty good."
"5963",5,"The Hilton BWI was wonderful. We were greeted by staff that was friendly and helpful. The room was absolutely great. I was shocked by the 42 in Plasma TV with HD programming. The service was excellent. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as the price is right. I will be staying there with my wife again."
"5964",1,"It was terrible i will never stay there again. Dirty, noisy, tv didnt work. The staff was a joke"
"5965",3,"Clean hotel. Metro style. About 2 blocks from all the sights in Savannah down by the river. VERY expensive parking! You have to valet and it is 27 a night! Street is noisy. Sheets are polyester. Bar is rather stake. Friendly staff."
"5966",1,"I would love to write a great reveiw to this Hotel, just like the majority of the other people here.However......I did not actually get to stay here. A booking was made by telephone for a 2 bed suite for New years Eve. We arrived ready to check in. Unfortunately the desk clerk was totally unhelpful. Our reservation was non existant. The clerk did not give a damn. We had travelled only a relatively short time (150 miles), but now were without accomodation on New Year. The clerk would not even help with finding an alternative. The reservation had been checked TWICE before arriving, The first time was 2 days prior, and then the night before arriving. The number we were given WAS confirmed both times on the phone, so we travelled to Anaheim without any worries. HOW WRONG WE WERE! The Reservation number that was confirmed twice has now upon arrival turned into a non existant number. There was no record of the whole transaction. After trying unsucsessfully to get any help whatsoever from the staff, we decided to give up and find an alternative. As can be expected the area was booked up, except for one place - a real roach motel. We chose to stay there (another bad choice) and had the worse night sleep ever . Thanks to Marriot the 2009 celebrations were ruined! What more can I say except - CHECK CHECK and double check, even after you receive a conformation number. Get it in writing!It looks like they had double booked and tried to fob us off . Hope this reveiw is helpful to everyone."
"5967",5,"I've been traveling for business for fourteen years (about every other week), and this was the best stay I've ever had. (That's not an exagerration this was the BEST stay that I can remember.) The site was brand new and spotless. The staff was extremely friendly. The location was perfect for my work, and plenty of dining options nearby. Because... More"
"5968",4,"Bad: The house is built in another age - access to rooms and room size are not large - but OK. The rooms are not well insulated reg. noise. The other guests behaved very nicely - good clientele - but when the garbage truck etc. is working out back, you will know it! Bring your earplugs and you'll be fine. Good: Staff was very helpful, courteous and professionel in a good way. Front desk staff responded quickly to my requests (WiFi code renewal, instruction in how to make calls from phone in room, air-con etc). I ran into the sales manager as well - I think the new owners are putting a pretty good team together, who all know that customer satisfaction is king!"
"5969",5,"We went to Maui for our Honeymoon for 10 days in October. We booked the first 5 nights at the Honua Kai and the last 5 at the Hyatt. We wish we would have stayed all 5 at the Honua Kai.

"5970",5,"Very nice. Very clean. Friendly staff. Loved it."
"5971",5,"I have a very picky family, when it comes to hotels, and this hotel delivered. Friendly staff, easy check-in/check-out process, and really comfy rooms. A recommended hotel for business or family travelers! Good location too!"
"5972",5,"I can't give this property enough praise. We stayed here quite unexpectedly because of a spring snowstorm that closed Raton Pass in the afternoon. We had to double back to Raton and began frantically calling hotels when it because apparent that we were not going to be able to make it home that night. We were among the lucky travelers... More"
"5973",5,"Wonderful staff!"
"5974",3,"Bad: I didn't care for the fact that we had to keep asking for the simple things such as, towels, sheets, glasses. Had to have them clean the tub before we even step foot in it because it was black at the bottom. Had to request that the garbage be emptied. Maintenance was called twice, once for the toilet and another because the air conditioning wasn't working. I would think for a hotel that charges you IN FULL for your stay before you leave the check in counter would be on top of things making their guests happier. Good: The view and location of the hotel was perfect and breakfast was nice except for the juices... The hotel outdoor pool was nice but the bar wasn't fully stocked and the food was HORRIBLE."
"5975",4,"We are on a road trip from Chicago to CA. We've stayed in Holiday Inn Express hotels one night at a time on the way. This was the best. It's only recently been built. The decor is upscale contemporay and the front desk staff were cheery and happy to see you. The Executive King rooms bed was very comfortable with... More"
"5976",4,"There is not a lot to offer in Tomah but this property makes sure you enjoy your stay. The staff was genuine and friendly. Breakfast was on point every morning. My room was always comfortable. Housekeeping needs to learn how to stop adjusting my thermostat is my only complaint."
"5977",3,"part of the hotel look great and updated, but the room needed a major renovation. carpet was dirty and wrinkled (could trip on it), and the bathroom was dingy: white enamel broken off on bathtub, toilet paper holder coming off the wall, dirty shower curtain, etc. but the bed was relatively comfy and the hotel quiet when we stayed there. complimentary shuttle to metro station was very convenient. staff was not very friendly and we could not order anything at the bar because there wasn't anyone there (bartender at some point was eating nearby in the lobby but did not acknowledge us and at other times the bar was empty)."
"5978",4,"We love to stay at W Hotels when we travel. This was a business trip and the stay was pleasant. The room was more than adequate. We were disappointed that there were NO drawers in the furniture in the room, so we had to improvise and stack things on the desk. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. We would definitely choose this location on our next Austin business trip."
"5979",3,"They charged 10.00 for Continental Breakfast even for minors, my grand daughter is 6 years old, how much can she eat, and you do not have any other choices for children, and if you want from a menu is over 14.00 per item."
"5980",3,"The room was ok, no water in the room, stains in the carpet and the water cost 3.00 p/b in the lobby. No parking and the valet cost 35.00 per day."
"5981",4,"came in, used toilet, wouldn't flush b/c chain detached, fixed myself next to exit door, all night heard people going in/out-I had to be up very early next morning and this was rather disruptive. I even had fan in bathroom and AC on"
"5982",5,"Clean room, very helpful staff. Had directions pre-printed to area malls, etc. Most hotels serve complimentary breakfast but these guys served dinner also. Real nice place."
"5983",5,"Stayed here for a short stay in Chicago - easy for travel as it's no more than a five minute walk from Jackson Station on the blue line from the airport.The hotel is conveniently located for downtown locations - some such as Sears Tower are within easy walking distance while others are no more than a short cab ride or a hop on the blue or red line away.While not huge the room we had was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. The staff were friendly and helpful.My only minor moan would be that we made the booking well in advance and the room rate seemed to be a good bit higher than that quoted on-line by the hotel just before we left."
"5984",5,"The hotel people were amazing with us. We went there because of the hurricane in Florida, we were sad and very stressed. They made us feel like in home. THANK YOU GUYS,,,,YOU DID IT GREAT. See you in a near future !!."
"5985",2,"The hotel is very close to the freeway - in fact we looked down on the off ramp. Looks like they are still updating - but the bathroom really needs help"
"5986",4,"The room was clean with appealing color palette. The downtown location was in close proximity to restaurants, etc. The valets were prompt and courteous. The staff was most hospitable. Would recommend to those traveling in Minneapolis!"
"5987",4,"Noise from traffic, not very sound proof. TV reception really bad at times Loved the size of the room, the staff were amazing and comfy bed"
"5988",4,"Hotel was not prepared for a busy Sunday night, as expressed by front desk staff. Many of us stood around waiting to get our rooms.

"5990",3,"This hotel was fully adequate for our family. It was nothing fancy but it was absolutely fine for what it was. It's set in the middle of a million other hotels with a Target and Starbucks nearby. Good proximity to various attractions including Disneyland, and Chapman University. Quiet, convenient."
"5991",3,"The first strike was a long wait to check in followed by average accomodations. Normal flickering bathroom lighting with marginal breakfast fare. All choice properties tend to be somewhat the same with the difference being the wifi here didn't work on this trip"
"5992",5,"Bad: The elevator was tricky to use as you had to insert your room key which didn't always work. The front desk never mentioned it either so I had to figure it out on my own. Good: The location was great. The room was basic but still nice and clean. The pool was low key, perfect for relaxing."
"5993",5,"My organization recently used this hotel for a conference and our experience could not have been better. From the planning phase through the meeting the staff was extremely helpful and kind, Rebecca was an absolute gem, particularly in troubleshooting for shuttling our group to where they needed to go. The facilities themselves were wonderful, and our attendees enjoyed the social... More"
"5994",5,"Great Property wow whet her with friends and its a great spot...the on site restuant has amazing food the Villas are amazing on the bay...great views...the pool was a fun area..it had pool ping pong tables a bar...sand voly ball ..overall a great visit ..would be great with a couple or a family....."
"5995",3,"Entire hotel smelled like an ashtray. The garbage can in the room was full from the previous occupant and no TP in the room. Other than that, it was just ok."
"5996",5,"Bad: Probably my oversight when Iread the description but I was surprised to find no mini fridge in the room. Good: Close to Colonial Williamsburg, clean with a friendly staff, and two great pools. The pools gave us downtime opportunity on a rainy day as well as on a sunny day."
"5997",1,"Our stay was very bad . It started off with waiting to check in for an hour. Then when we got to our room our bed sheets had a whole in it and not to mention our Toilet would not flush . When I went down to complain about it the front deal receptionist had an attitude . For Over 200 a night I would expect to be treated better and the hotel to be updated . I would never ever say here again ."
"5998",5,"I need quality rest during the day because I work at night and being tired is not an option in my line of work. The hotel staff make sure there are no issues with noise and the rooms are very clean and comfortable"
"5999",5,"We were extremely satisfied with our stay. They have an excellent breakfast which we enjoyed everyday we were there. The rooms have everything you need for an extended stay. Everything you would need for cooking and serving meals, plus a full size refrigerator, microwave, stove and oven. Very comfortable room. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Joy at the front desk was very helpful during our stay.

"6000",4,"We enjoyed our stay at the Mills House. It was in a great area and we could walk to everything. We chose this hotel because of the area and the pool. We had two kids who enjoyed the pool very much! The valets at this hotel were very helpful and accommodating!"
"6001",5,"The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and well maintained. I did find a couple of ladybugs near the window, but nothing to worry about. The TV even had a sleep timer. Love that feature."
"6002",4,"Pretty close to SF, about 30min and most important next to Rt 80. The best part of the trip was taking the ferry from Vallejo to SF which station is like 15min from the hotel and it helped us avoid traffic to the city. Very friendly staff, actually the girl at the lobby recommended me to take the ferry and... More"
"6003",5,"Hotel and staff were exceptional. Check in and check out were a breeze. The bedding was comfortable after a long day of travel. The breakfast was hot and delicious and included choice of eggs, bacon, oatmeal, waffle, choice of pastries and beverages. The room and bathroom were tidy. I will definitely return."
"6004",4,"Three of us stayed here on Saturday and Sunday while in town for the NASCAR race and we could not have stayed at a nicer place, literally and figuratively. The room was spacious and very clean, and the staff could not have been more accommodating. Special shout out to our new friend Larry behind the desk AND the bar........ The... More"
"6005",5,"Our room was very clean and comfortable. The beds and pillows were perfect. Teresa, the manager, was very welcoming to us. Although the pool was not open yet we enjoyed the warm Texas sunshine on the patio. There is also a grill if you want to BBQ. The complimentary breakfast was good and the staff replenished it as needed. We... More"
"6006",4,"I was on a weekend trip to attend Gonzaga. Everything about the hotel was great except that they don't offer any shuttle services.Most of the like priced hotels nearby do."
"6007",4,"I stayed here for a few days. The staff is very attentive, and keeps the building in great shape. The rooms and property are well kept. The breakfast is kept stocked up.and they provide sack breakfast if you have to eat on the run. My only complaint would be on the location of the coffee pot. It is in the... More"
"6008",5,"Would recommend overall. We were there in January and the weather was very cold. We expected outside to be cold. The hotel's entrance doors were open a lot, tho, and that made the restaurant and seating ,common areas too cold to enjoy. Happy hour cold, breakfast cold Poor concierge employees very cold. Other times of the year would be better...OR rotational doors, Rooms was great and comfort in the room spot on"
"6009",3,"This Hotel was clean and well kept.. However because I have children they put me on the Same floor as other children. I was woken up many times throughout the night by screaming children and they were not my own!It was very loud throughout the night of people talking and running up and down the hallways! I was quite disturbed by this. Overall the room was comfortable just very loud and obnoxious people that happened to stay there which is unfortunate."
"6010",5,"Upon arriving to our hotel we were greeted warmly by a friendly door man then proceed to check in where a friendly and helpful gentlemen named Tim took care of us at the desk and set us up with a spacious room with a spectacular view. The stay here really helped make our trip to Chicago amazing and very enjoyable. Tim and Devon were more than willing to help us with any questions we had about getting around the city, which was a very nice gesture you don't see often. Thank You to the staff, we will definetly return to see them again the next time we are in town."
"6011",5,"Very friendly service. One of the best values in lodging today. Excellent rooms. Hope to stay here again. If you like a small town atmosphere and down home service, look no further. The large undercover seating area is great for visiting or just relaxing."
"6012",4,"I booked this room for a concert my husband and I went to. We only needed the room one night but opted for the king suite. Rooms was great, breakfast was willing. You have to walk a little to get to places but if we could do it in the frigid AC air, anyone can. Highly reccomend!"
"6013",5,"Bad: More comfortable seating in the breakfast area. Good: Excellent location, really convenient for exploring Boston and close to the underground for travelling to the airport. Comfortable room and convenient breakfast facilities."
"6014",5,"staff was very helpful,breakfast included really makes a difference when you travel.clean and close to all major roads. this location also makes it nice due to a walking down down type of area with shops and many types of eateries available. also a food stor in the next parking lot."
"6015",5,"This hotel certainly keeps with the Ritz Carlton name. Great surroundings. great service, and great food all made for a relaxing stay."
"6016",5,"Great place, location, and I appreciate the coffee available in the lobby."
"6017",3,"I was really disappointed that they didn't clean my room (includes making my bed and providing fresh towels) one of the days. Everything else was great. The bed was very comfortable and the rooms are very nice. Need to improve the service a bit."
"6018",3,"First I want to say a big Thank You to everyone at Ramada who made my stay such a memorable one.I was greeted at the airport with a warm welcome from Mario the van driver who remember me from the time he saw me on the pavement, Alberto at concierge who welcome me back.Marielys Ana in the restaurant at...

"6019",5,"From the second you Valet your car, to check-in, service is phenomenal. Highly recommend this luxury hotel. We stay here most times when visiting Las Vegas. Never have we been disappointed. We stayed in a corner suite facing the strip with 3 TVs and 2 bathrooms...can't get much nicer then that!"
"6020",5,"We stayed at the North Star Lodge over the Martin Luther King weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the condition of the property. Our room was recently renovated. It was spacious, nicely decorated and had comfortable beds. A new LCD TV and DVD player were in the room. Although the wall are paper thin, earplugs made sure I slept soundly.... More"

"6022",5,"We spent five nights at the Aria for our 1st anniversary. This was our second visit to this hotel. Once again they surpassed our expectations!! We were put into a corner suite on the 18th floor with amazing views. The room was so comfortable that it made it hard to want to leave to do anything else. There are so... More"

"6026",5,"Went for a couple of nights with my wife and our 3 kids and all of us came back home with wonderful memories. We really enjoyed having the opportunity to BBQ our own dinner and enjoying our meal on the magnificent patio. Rooms and all amenities very very clean."
"6027",3,"Hotel was beautiful. Parking is weird. Paid 20 a night or you have to figure out how to park outback for free. No microwave or fridge in room only avaliable in suites. They kept messing up on room charges. Charging a 150 deposit fee saying it's a 50 fee per night you stay. Didn't make sense. Double charger a friend who was staying in the room next to ours. The staff was nice. I think it was a lot going on due to graduation season."
"6028",5,"I've come to expect an excellent level of comfort at Hilton brand hotels, and this Hampton Inn did not disappoint! Spotlessly clean, with friendly staff, free breakfast and comfortable rooms. This hotel also has a shuttle service to downtown Newport, which is very convenient, since parking is at a premium during the summer season."
"6029",5,"I decided to stay here to have a quick and easy drive to the airport in the morning. This property is brand new and fabulous. My jaw literally dropped when I went to check out the exercise room! Easy drive to chain restaurants and Target. I wish all properties were like this one!"
"6030",5,"I have stayed here several times before. Breakfast is above average with a large area. Employees were very nice. The only complaint I had this time around was the extra soft bed. I felt like I couldn't even sit or lay on the end or sides of the bed without feeling like I was falling off, but that's just my opinion. Still a great place to stay."
"6031",4,"We were looking for a Saturday night stay. Most hotels require a 2-night minimum. Inn at the Vines would book a one night for a Queen bed, which was fine with us. AAA discount was 186. If you have a BW member then you get a free breakfast at Denny's which is next door. Hotel was refurbished about 1-year ago, so everything was clean and fresh. Only issue is the in-wall air conditioning units are too loud to run while sleeping.Great location and convenient to freeways.Thank you for your review! I am sorry about the noisey a/c unit and will have it checked out. Almost all units have been replaced and maybe we missed one somehow. Your sleep and comfort is our main goal and with a little fun on the side. Come back and let us show why we are BEST WESTERN!"
"6032",5,"For basic accommodations, this place is perfect. Right in the center of town, welcoming staff, clean room, couldn't ask for more. With a restaurant on-premises, it was perfect for breakfast and great for sunset in the afternoon."
"6033",5,"One of the best hotels I stayed. A++"
"6034",3,"IF your looking for an affordable place close to DC this is the perfect place. It was convenient with 2 children to have a kitchen and a little extra room. The hotel offers a shuttle to the metro station but we found the walk to be pleasant and only 10 minutes away. There aren't any restaurants nearby so you either have to plan in advance or order food to be delivered. Another added benefit is the free parking, and plenty of it. I would probably stay again, if only for the location."
"6035",5,"This all suite hotel is just perfect. The staff is very friendly, helpful and attentive. The room was fantastic. 750 square feet of pure luxury with a view of downtown la and more. The furnishings were stylish, mid-century/modern mix. The bathroom was like having our own private spa in our room. All white tile with a soaking tub for two.... More"

"6037",3,"I travel a lot for business and generally use Best Western. This hotel was not up to par for BW. The carpet was stained and dirty. It had a 4 hole in the threshold between bed/bath rooms.

"6038",1,"We had no tv service and was told we could move or we could be taken care when we checked out.. we chose to stay in the room as we where unpacked , it was late and we were ready for bed. When we checked out we where then told we had to talk to the manager as we booked thru expedia. It took over week to track the manager down (i left at least three messages on her voicemail). Only to be told that their policy was to move us ... she was rude in her dealing with the situation...thats not what we where told at the time...when I pushed it i was given the option of 10 off my next stay..also ...it was a long weekend and the hotel was busy ... the breakfast area needed attended to...food running out and a little cleaning was in order...the front desk person was friendly and did her best to replenish and a very bus time for her at the desk...when i asked housekeeping for a new ice bucket (as ours had a crack in it and was leaking) she rolled her eyes at me and sighed like i was putting her out... this hotel could use some renovatons and attention in order to be up to Ramada standard. P.S. I fly alot and have used this hotel at least 3 or 4 times .... there will not be another stay there. and not recommending it."
"6039",5,"Great space and the bed was heavenly. The only critiques I had were the fact that I had to pay 15 for wifi and there was no room service, both of which surprised me about a hotel at this price point."
"6040",5,"My visit was like my previous ones. Fantastic. I was welcomed at the front desk by Carolyn. But it didn't end there. All of the Hotels employees I encountered were equally welcoming. And upon entering my room I was greeted by an Oxford Suites coffee mug with a welcome note and chocolate. Thank you Deborah. Breakfast was great. Lacy makes... More"
"6041",3,"Agree with previous review, renovation consisted of mostly new paint. No fault of hotel, but be prepared for a night with plenty of noise....street cars passing all night!! Food at restaurants is excellent. Employees are very nice. If you are looking for a really first class hotel at this price point, I would suggest Ritz Carlton, Windsor Court, Roosevelt. One... More"
"6042",1,"I was highly disappointed this time around. This is my second time staying at this hotel and I did not like anything about our room. The 1st time we stayed here the room and price was great so we decided to stay again. We wanted a Jacuzzi and we were told in the room description that we would have one, but instead when we got to the room we had a regular jetted tub that did not work at all. We paid double for a room expecting something spectacular and we got nothing. The breakfast was okay, but it was so congested that you really could not enjoy your meal . Unfortunately, we will not be staying at this hotel again."
"6043",5,"I had a change of plans in my day and went in to check in at 11am or a little after so I wouldn't have to at 2am. The front desk staff was very accommodating and allowed me to with no hesitation. Room was very clean."
"6044",5,"Good: Great property! Excellent team of young dedicated profeccionals"
"6045",2,"The price of the room says it all. It is a cheap hotel room. Clean and OK to stay for a single night when you want a cheap hotel to come in late and stay overnight and get up early and leave. However, the only real big problem with the place is the smell of cigarette smoke that permeates the room!!! It is unbelievable. DO NOT turn on the fan in the bathroom and bring an air freshener. With the LOUD air conditioner on, the room becomes air becomes equalized enough to sleep there. You have been warned !"

"6047",5,"I stay here 3-4 times per year. Consistent service, cleanliness, bed comfort, etc. If you haven't stayed in a microtel hotel it's nothing fancy but this location is well kept."
"6048",4,"We stayed here one night along with 10 of our travelling companions. Most of our group complained that they could hear partying in rooms next to them. Reporting the noise to the desk did not solve the problem. There was a group of school kids in the hotel, the night we stayed there. The rooms are nice and well equipped... More"
"6049",4,"We had a power outage and had to think quickly. I went online and saw this hotel. The staff was great. The young man was training someone when we walked in but made us feel very welcomed."
"6050",3,"Rudeness at front desk. When we checked in the front desk person was unfriendly and short of patience with my hard of hearing issue. We witnessed a very insulting exchange from a front desk person to another guest. Housekeepers were very pleasant and helpful. Rooms were small and did not seem up to the Doubletree standard we have seen in other Doubletree hotels."
"6051",5,"An excellent team to assist you. Opt for the valet parking. Nice rooms restaurant on site, front desk service available for your needs. Closest hotel to aquarium. Walking distance to Phillips arena. Well priced value for sure."
"6052",5,"We stayed here for 4 nights over Thanksgiving. Our family had one of the suites that sleep five, and it was nice and spacious. You can tell the hotel is pretty new. Everything was in good working order. The room layout could have been slightly improved, as you really can't see the TV from the sofa. The bed linens were... More"
"6053",5,"We truly enjoyed the forest atmosphere around the lodge. The room was great and the comfort level was excellent. It was very quiet in the lodge and there was lots of gathering places to read, or just relax. The morning breakfasts were outstanding. The staff went out of their way to accomodate my dietary needs. We will return."
"6054",1,"We checked in and after trying two rooms we immediately checked right back out and slept in the car. The beds had hair in them and makeup and dirt on the pillow cases and sheets.

"6057",2,"I'm surprised this hotel is even part of the Best Western chain. They supplied only one wash cloth. We got a conditioner bottle, but no shampoo. Our food was thrown away even though we had it neatly stored in a box on the coffee table. The buffet breakfast was lacking. It had stale donuts and danish. The only hot food was hard boiled eggs and grits. On the positive side, bed was comfortable and good front desk service."
"6058",2,"We have previously stayed at the Palms Hotel with a beachfront room, but they are closed all summer for renovations, so we went a couple of buildings down to Seaside Inn expecting a smaller room but similar accommodations, so much of this critique is comparing Seaside to the Palms. We had a beachfront room and although the balcony was spacious... More"
"6059",4,"So many of these hotels act like they are doing you a favor for letting you stay with them. This hotel was truly a friendly and accommodating place with a nice friendly gentleman who welcomed me and a wonderful young lady who checked me out. The rooms are missing a microwave that is about it."
"6060",4,"Bad: Way overpriced. Room was overdesigned faux industrial window box. Bed not comfortable at all. Good: Great location"

"6065",5,"We loved this hotel - particularly as we had left a pretty grim hotel to turn up here without a booking, as a last resort. The staff was amazing, the food in the restaurant exceptional and the Fourth of July vibe, fun and friendly but not crazy."
"6066",3,"Good for its purpose which was to stay there only long enough to sleep. Fan in room was so loud that we had to shut the air off for the night. Lots of road noise. The breakfast was good with lots of options and great service by the folks managing it."
"6067",5,"Great stay, courteous staff, noon check out......perfect after a very long drive!"
"6068",4,"The hotel was awesome. We even got to see the Bones, Thugs and Harmony entourage. :P The only downside is that the pool was a little gross and murky. My son didn't care but I wouldn't step foot in there. It was tough to see the bottom. Unfortunately part of my search criteria for a Baltimore hotel was if it had a pool."
"6069",5,"If you love luxury, impeccably clean rooms, stunning art, and eclectic eateries, than this place is for you.

The room was very comfortable, the only issue was the size of the pillows. I thought they were too small for a king size room. I asked about them, but that was all they had. We would still... More"
"6073",4,"I had a very nice stay at the Virginian Suites. They are remodeling the hotel, and you can really tell by the quality of the room. It was very modern, clean, and comfortable. My only complaints are thus- the hotel is extremely difficult to find. I suppose that's not the hotel's fault, it is a very confusing area of town anyways. Also, I was not aware that I would have to pay 7 extra dollars for parking. Just wish I would have been aware of this ahead of time. I would, however, stay there again."
"6074",1,"The other review was obviously written by one of the owners. Grossest room I have ever been in.

"6076",4,"Hotel was a fantastic location. The room was unique and we'll maintained. Enjoyed the blue light located throughout the property. Bed was conformable, however small. Good and happy vibe. 1 opportunity I would make for improvement is the timeliness for valet. Car retrival took well over 30 mintutes. I noticed their bell staff was not around and the lobby hardly have anyone in it. When you are paying 30+ for valet it should be rocket speed. Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your time here and we hope you will come back and see us again. Parking and valet services can take some time because our parking lot is located six blocks off-site. We are happy that even though you experienced issues with this you still enjoyed your stay."

"6078",4,"Nice spacious rooms, good location . The only thing bad about it is that they don't have buffet breakfast and it takes lot of time to get a table and it becomes quite expensive too. 2 of the mornings, I was offered high chairs of bar for breakfast which is not ideal when you pay about 60 dollars for simple omlette, juice and black coffee. But overall very good.Dear neeraj821,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York, and thank you for your comments regarding breakfast.

I spoke to her a few hours earlier to ask if someone can set up the sofa bed on the room since we where running late and going straight to bed. She did that for us, which I really appreciate. Thanks. The breakfast was delicious and the two attendances where so sweet. I don't remember their names, but I just want to say thanks. The lady that speaks noticed my puertorrican accent and told me that she hopes that everything is good with my family back in the island. From the bottom of my heart thank you for been so sweet with me.During check out, Joy, was so understandable with me and my group.

"6080",5,"Stay was great and nice friendly staff."
"6081",3,"One night stay for business was fine. The room was clean, staff was nice, and breakfast was ok."
"6082",3,"The room was really tiny but clean and there was no elevator to second floor. That was very inconvenient for us as we had a lot of luggage. And the unkind front desk lady was not helpful at all. Too pricey for what you get."
"6083",4,"I found this trip on this site and I'm glad I did, it was a great choice. The rooms are smallish but comfortable, and since the trip was a Conference, I wasn't going to be here much anyway.Complimentary wireless access makes this an even better deal. The restaurant is OK but not great (room service through them was very unfriendly), but they have a Starbucks next door for breakfast as well. Conveniently located."
"6084",5,"The place to meet after a long day at UFOfest. I had a very tasty burger with all the trimmings and tried some imaginative beers. Great atmosphere is half the journey to a good meal experience. Try the roof top on a sunny day, relax and watch the clouds go by."
"6085",5,"This Quality Inn is in a great location and the staff is amazing. Beds were comfortable and very clean I was impressed with how large and spacious the rooms are. I could go on and on about how happy I am with my stay. I will see you again when I am passing through again this weekend."
"6086",5,"Nice"
"6087",5,"We pick the Aria for laid back location and the modern feel. The staff seems to care. Yes we lost all our gambling funds but the atmosphere and vibe was worth it. It is a special place..great for the modern crowd but not extremely trendy..."
"6088",5,"I came to this lovely motel from New York and had requested a bonfire and the manager had set it up very beautifully for my family and I. We sat around it and told stories and made s'mores. This bonfire had given us the opportunity to spend quality time with my loved ones. The rooms were nice and clean and... More"
"6089",4,"The front desk supervisor/manager was rude and not helpful at all. I asked for extra towels 3 times and never got them. The elevator took 10 minutes to come."
"6090",4,"We stayed at the resort Feb 16-19 first visit ever to longboat key or to the resort. Traveled with my 2 teenage daughters and originally had booked a Junior suite for the three of us. Upon arrival we realized that the room was way too small, essentially a king bed and a sleeper sofa in the same space, so decided... More"
"6091",1,"First night was okay, there a band aid was in the pool, my gf pointed it out and we left to our room. Second night a water pipe burst causing water outage for the whole building and damaging their computer area. Our room and our friends adjacent room had ants in it. The phone in our room was not connecting to any inner hotel numbers so we couldn't have notified them of this issue or any medical emergency even if we wanted to using their phone system. When we left Sunday morning I notified the front desk of these issues and they said hotel GM would be calling me to try and rectify the situation. This never happened. After waiting a week I contacted the hotel for a refund for the one night and they informed me since I booked through Expedia I would have to contact them. After getting a hold of Expedia they contacted the hotel and were able to retrieve 1/2 of the cost of the night. I was amazed the hotel would not refund us our entire night considering the conditions of the rooms and lack of basic services. We could not go to the bathroom for the entire night (verified this at 10 PM, and again in the morning at 10 AM, the water in the toilets were backing up after one flush) and had to drive down to Chevron a few miles down the road to use their facilities and purchase drinking water. I can't even begin to comprehend how refunding half the night for these kind of inconveniences is fair to anyone who stayed during this time. I cannot recommend this place."
"6092",1,"Not pleasant at all. Loud noises and voices after midnight. Parking lot and stairs in a very bad condition. People who checked me in and out seem to be too busy and in a bad mood."
"6093",3,"location is good but an extremely noisy place cannot sleep if u are staying on the lower lever room the rooms on the upper lever all night with people footsteps thudding and u end up being awake so i just felt i wasted spending 395 for 3 NIGHTS with no peace"
"6094",5,"My experience at the Quality Inn and Suites in Ashland, Virginia was wonderful. From the time I entered the hotel till I checked out, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was really inviting with modern decor with pleasing restful colors. The bed was really comfortable with lots of pillows. The full, hot breakfast was delicious with a... More"
"6095",3,"You're staff all had told me different thing upon booking and arrival. They had told me about certain specials when I called and booked 2 weeks prior then on the day of...they were all confused on pricing and specials. They didn't understand why we were booked at a specific price as well as I am active navy. I was disappointed... More"
"6096",5,"Would be nice if the duvet were in a duvet cover as I just get tangled between the flat sheets and the comforter Gym could really do with some more variety in terms of machinery - Its impossible to do much leg work as there is no squat rack with a bar - or even a smith machine which has multiple purposes Super helpful staff 24/7 - very accommodating of my unusual hours Room service menu is amazing Views are amazing Cerise Bar on the roof is epic and the bartenders are amazing I will be coming back and SOON!"
"6097",1,"Our one night at this roach motel was awful. While the manager on duty was very pleasant, our room was less than satisfactory. There was no remote for the TV. The water in the bathroom ran lukewarm in the shower and sink. Two of our towels were a gross grey color. We asked for a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in our room quite recently. Worst of all, the people on either side of us decide... view mored to stand outside and talk very loudly until midnight. They screamed, yelled, slammed doors, and stomped back and forth for two hours. When we went to check out, there was no one available. We had to leave without being properly checked out. This roach motel is not worth the money."
"6098",3,"Good location-room nice and near good places to eat."
"6099",3,"Loud all night view of river is actually a freeway, hotel does, not follow consumer policies has shown all of her website, all of the rooms all over Hotel, Instead they offer you a water bottle. Seriously"
"6100",4,"We stayed for just overnite on our way to Sault Ste Marie. They were not very busy. The first room they assigned was next to the pool, we knew this would be noisy.. After finding this out, we went to the front desk to ask for another room. They quickly gave us another room. The room was comfortable and clean,... More"
"6101",4,"Spent one night here on our way out to Rapid City. Newly renovated room was clean and comfortable. Our small children slept on the pullout couch which was just he right size for them. Definitely would stay again!Dear 893trishac, Thank you so much for the positive feedback regarding your recent stay and about our newly renovated rooms. We are so happy that you enjoyed the new space! Please come back soon, we would love to have you!! Sincerely, Diane Hanisch General Manager"
"6102",5,"Everything was great. Beds a little stiff, something slightly softer would have been great. No bacon at breakfast, bacon at breakfast would be an improvement also. Everyone was very nice and the value was good."
"6103",5,"The staff were outstanding! So professional courteous! I will definitely stay here again!"
"6104",5,"My family had an amazing experience. We arrived early and staff had a room ready for us. The walk to the tram is very short.. breakfast was good but would preffered scramble eggs and potatoes. The only problem was the parking, but staff made it easy to find one for us. Thanks for all the help!!!"
"6105",2,"Pillows are uncomfortable Spotted babies cockroaches in kitten. No utensils. So prepare to bring things you need."
"6106",5,"Good: We loved our stay at this hotel. All the staff specially the people in the front desk were extremely nice. Our room was very clean. Bed was really comfortable. The pool area was very relaxing. We had the hotel breakfast twice and both days it was fresh and tasty. We were also able to see magic kingdoms fire work show from the outside of our room because it was facing the park."
"6107",5,"Bad: The meat at breakfast was horrible. Cheap no taste and the yogurt was horrible to I can tell it was real cheap brand . Good: The reception was so nice she let me check in early and the room was very clean. My kids love the pool."
"6108",5,"What a place. Brought the wife for a business trip and she and I both loved it. Great location and the staff treat to your every needs. Excellent in every way. NYC has a lot of offer in hotels this is one of the best. Dear Arubaman2016, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning! We would love to have you as our guest in the futureSincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"6109",5,"Repeat customer planning our next visit. Comfortable rooms, great food and accommodating hosts. Ken and Lisa are always helpful in suggesting additional exploring options in the area, such as a farmer's market or local artists."
"6110",5,"Clean, comfortable hotel with friendly and helpful staff!"
"6111",4,"Friendly staff was very helpful. Hotel is conveniently located near restaurants and the highway. Room's window faced a blank wall of the hotel next door. But it was very quiet at night and felt safe. Would stay again."
"6112",3,"The room was decent as far as cleanliness, however, the room was very small with two beds and there was no closet or rack to hang up your clothing. It was ok, since we were there to attend a concert and shop at outlet, so the room served the purpose. I must say the bathroom was in great shape, there was no mold or mildew in the tub and it appeared that the room and bathroom had a fresh coat of paint and the tub was new. It served the purpose"
"6113",4,"We didn't stay at the hotel but went for breakfast twice because it was so good. The service is the best, there's a friendly parrot sitting in the corner to add to the ambiance (if you go talk to him he'll ask you if you're drunk) and the food was perfect! They have American classics plus Hawaiian traditional favorites. I... More"
"6114",5,"Have not stopped at a Drury Inn in quite a while. The last time we did was not a good experience. But because of the reviews decided to give Drury another chance. Glad we did. Do not hesitate to stop at this hotel."
"6115",4,"Bad: There was loud music playing at night and in the morning. Luckily I'm a heavy sleeper so it didn't really bother me. Good: Great location in Miami Beach (south). Close to all the action but off the main stretch so it's more peaceful. Near to lots of shops. There was an issue with our room and we had to spend one night in their sister hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful to make sure we were comfortable. The hotel offers a portable wifi hotspot for guests to take out with them - very cool!"
"6116",4,"Bad: Valet parking was a little pricey."
"6117",5,"I recently attended a conference held at ARIA Las Vegas. This was my first trip to Vegas but it definitely won't be my last! The conference accommodations were fantastic (room temperature was a bit too cold at times) however, I fell in love with this hotel. The ARIA buffet has so many international food options, I felt I was dining... More"
"6118",4,"Bad: Not sure about deluxe room i was in. Good: Location"
"6119",2,"We made reservations on November 9, 2011 for a stay on the night of May 16, 2012 and specifically asked for a non-smoking room. When we arrived at 11 p.m., the desk clerk casually told us the only room left was a smoking room. No explanation as to what had happen to our reservation for a non-smoking room. No apology. She couldn't have cared less. The smell that greeted us when we opened the door to the room was unbelievable. I slept with a clean towel on my pillow to avoid the tobacco smell that permeated every inch of the room. Not going back there anytime soon."
"6120",4,"Staff was friendly and place was clean and very nice. Only issues that we had was the windows were a bit drafty, not sealing very well and most of the TV channels went out in the evening and didn't come back up until the time we left. I inquired several times at the front desk and they said they were working on it. I understand the weather was not good and may have affected it but not for as long as it was. Other than that, the stay was really really nice and comfortable."
"6121",3,"This was a clean and very acceptable basic motel. We got in late, went to bed, showered in the morning and left.The owners were friendly and easy to deal with.I would definitely consider this motel for a subsequent visit."
"6122",5,"Beautiful part of Denver. Easy access to freeways and so, to other parts of town. Nice choice of restaurants, and grocery stores. Enjoyed having a room with a kitchenette. Mostly appreciated the friendly and helpful staff. Easy five stars all around for this property."
"6123",3,"Personnel were friendly. Good if you need just a bed, shower, television and bathroom. Old but clean. No refrigerator or microwave. Very good for what I needed.I would stay there again. Low budget but clean."
"6124",4,"Very helpful knowledgable staff. Great location, poor wifi."
"6125",3,"Very nice accommodations conveniently located at Turkey Creek shopping area of Knoxville. Very good value for the price. Staff extremely helpful. Stayed here one night while Christmas shopping in the Knoxville area. Would highly recommend."
"6126",3,"Lovely grounds. We had a very nice one bedroom condo on 8th floor, mountain view. Full kitchen. We stayed 15 nights and having more room (745 sq ft) made a difference. The cleaning service was a bit of a joke, however: only every other day, mainly to change the linens. Outdoors the space was pretty but not very functional. I... More"
"6127",4,"Just stayed overnight enroute to my daughters college campus . But the room was v clean well stocked , with an attentive room service lady . V comfortable . Neighborhood I was not sure about --was told it was safer to stay in after hours !"
"6128",5,"Had a wonderful time here, and I will be coming back! The rooms are very nice, it's located perfectly close to everything, and the staff accommodates your needs to the best of their ability!"
"6129",2,"This place is as basic an accommodation as you can get in downtown Atlanta while still being suitable. Yes there is free parking but this place is so cheap that they don't even give you free shampoo in the bathroom - just two little bars of facial soap. Place isn't in the greatest area (downtown Atlanta is kind of sketchy at night) but is centrally located. For a healthy restaurant nearby I recommend Metrofresh - it's less than a ten minute drive and totally worth it! Basic cheap motel quality beds, old TVs, frustrating elevator that takes forever to close and absolutely NO FRILLS. Got it for 53/night using a coupon code on the Motel6 website."

All Handicapped Accessible hotel rooms are NOT the same! 1. I could open the front door from my wheelchair. It was not too heavy to handle 2. The door stayed open instead of attacking me as... More"
"6131",5,"The lodging options in this small town are limited but frankly, this hotel works very well. It's clean, well located and has a very friendly staff. The bed was comfortable and had great pillows. What more do you need"
"6132",5,"We stayed for 5 nights, and we were extremely pleased. It's not a new building, but it is well maintained. What we were most pleased about was the breakfast buffet! It was a true buffet (not just pre-wrapped pastries)--Eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, waffles, cereal, fruit, bagels, toast, etc. This saved us a lot of money, because we could start the day with a hearty meal. Additionally, Stacy at the front desk was very helpful with all kinds of information. I highly recommend this hotel! We hope to stay there again in August."
"6133",4,"Bad: The bed was like sleeping on plywood. I couldnt wait to get up. Good: Awesome omelette"
"6134",4,"I originally booked a queen room but was surprised to see there were two double beds was no issue at all given the extra bed was good for space and to add I wasn't expecting a kitchenette in the room. Could have been some more toiletries and maybe cook ware and silverware but good to know next time what to bring. Front desk staff very cool and even with us waking up late and checking out a half hour after the set time there was no issue at all no one bothers about it given we did check in late. Very appreciated."
"6135",3,"Noisy at night Door didn't latch easily hotel reduced cost of stay after learning of problems"
"6136",5,"Since I was meeting a friend coming in at Midway, and being able to shop at the mall right next door, and eat at an IHOP, also right next door in that mall... Everything to make that weekend easy and fun was close at hand.Plus I had to remind myself where I was when I woke up each morning, because the bed was firm, like my own bed at home, so I was very comfortable."
"6137",2,"Hotel was quiet. Other than the AC that looked like it came out of a crack house and the worn out mattress and elevator it was fair. Does management ever check the rooms I like Hampton Inns yet I cannot stand dirty AC. Come on Hampton. You can do better than this. I checked in late and the staff was... More"
"6138",3,"Bad: There is spa in the name of the hotel and the spa service wasn't available! What a rip-off!. Good: The room was nice with a good view"
"6139",5,"Very good situation in the center of Philadelphia, the beds are perfects. Our only night here was just great, the night are completly dark, which is important for us, and very quiet. John was very helpfull. Thank youCD, We appreciate the great review! Glad you got to take advantage of the blackout shades and quiet space for a restful night sleep. Hope to have you back for more than one night! Evan"
"6140",5,"This is, by far, one of the most beautiful, well-appointed clean places I've ever stayed. The staff was exceptional, polite, helpful and friendly. Brian took extra efforts to ensure our stay was perfect. He even took us on a tour of the other side of the hotel. One side (where I stayed) was very modern while the other side was... More"
"6141",2,"We stayed at the SpringHill Suite Norfolk Old Dominion University for our daughter's graduation. Upon check in we were told that even though we had prepaid our room or so we thought that Old Dominion SpringHill Suites didn't actually charge us. We were ok with that. We checked in Shaneel at the front desk was amazing. An asset to the... More"
"6142",4,"I always joke with my parents since this is their hotel. My wife and I stayed there two nights and I have to say it was excellent. Room view was great. Lots to do for families (bowling, movies, arcade). Clearly not a Paris, Caesers, Belligio but then the prices aren't either. Lots of elderly people mixed in with families. It was a good change of pace from the strip and an entirely different feel (thats good and bad)."
"6143",1,"This is another typical motel run down by the ownership of a person from India. I will give them credit as the sheets were clean however the shower stall was dirty, there was no shower head just a pipe, the towels were stained and the carpet was so dark you couldn't tell if it was clean or not. The swimming... More"
"6144",1,"I had a surprisingly disappointing stay at what I thought was supposed to be a nice hotel. We were moving apartments close by, and I booked a 3 night stay. The service was almost non-existent. We asked for a crib before check-in, then again three separate times after we checked in. It finally arrived after 11 PM! We asked for silverware so that we could eat our room service. Never brought it. We ended up eating with coffee stirrers in the room. No one offered a smile or hello, or offered to open a door when I was coming through with a stroller. The rooms are very dated. Overall, just a very disappointing stay. It seems like this hotel is just resting on a famous name.Dear LK198200,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While we wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve. We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short. It is important to us to do what we can to make amends for your stay. If you would like to further discuss your visit, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Hotel Manager, Massimiliano Puglisi, directly at Massimiliano.PuglisiRosewoodhotels.com. If you give us a chance to earn back your trust, I can assure you that we will do our best to give you the great hotel experience that so many of our guests have grown so fond of.

"6147",3,"The bed was broken but was still comfortable, just a bit sunken in. The floor was a bit dirty but overall everything was good."
"6148",5,"We recently spent eight days at Honua Kai, Konea Tower studio/ocean view on the 8th floor. The grounds are immaculate and staff was friendly and helpful. We've never stayed in a condo for vacation before but found our stay to be the best of both a full service hotel and the convenience of a condo. Our kids loved the pools... More"
"6149",5,"Needed a good sleep as we were passing through. Comfort inn was great. Quick friendly check in, comy bed, large clean room, working ac and hot shower. Breakfast was well stocked. Would stay here again"
"6150",5,"3rd Floor, Ocean View, Deluxe room made great memories with my significant other. They gave us a free breakfast down the road and they let us check out a little later. Overall this was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again."
"6151",5,"Bad: Possibly lower parking rates,."
"6152",4,"Stayed overnight on 4/23/16 with my sister at the hotel and was very pleasantly surprised! The hotel's location was great and the interiors were very stylish. My sister and I stayed in a room with a wonderful view of Trump Tower, Marina City, the Chicago's river and bridges. The room itself, although small, was clean and nicely decorated. Our room had twin beds that were firm but comfortable to sleep on. The hotel was perfect for our needs! We wanted a place to stay near the loop where we could make the most of our weekend downtown. Also, the staff was friendly and the customer service manager that assisted us, Pedro, was very helpful. We plan on coming again in the fall for another weekend downtown and will be staying there again.Dear 216jvs,Thank you for your detailed review of the River Hotel. I am so glad you found the room and staff services to your liking and you were able to enjoy your weekend from our ideal location in the heart of the city. Pedro is a great asset to our operation and I will make sure he sees your kind words.We look forward to welcoming you back in the fall!"
"6153",5,"We needed a place to stay as our bathroom was being renovated. Extremely quick check in ( called earlier to make reservation). We walked in, gave our name and we were headed to our room in under 3 minutes. No need to give a plate number for our car. Check out was even faster. When we went to the front... More"

"6155",2,"We stayed at this motel for 5 months. The room, although clean, spacious and relatively bug free, (saw several roaches) was not well lit, had cracks and scratches in the walls, and was noisy.

"6158",5,"In the hinterlands, this BW+ is like an oasis. The facility is in just-built, not-yet-used condition, exterior to beds, Staff always well-groomed, friendly, polite and helpful. Amenities work perfectly. Great restaurants and service stations nearby. We plan our daily mileage so we can stop here."
"6159",5,"Was a great 1 night stay. Lobby was beautiful, very clean, nice personable staff. Rooms were very nice! Wish they had an option for a room w a King bed and a sofa bed, we needed to get the rollaway, which was ok, but only sleeps 1. Pool was nice, kids enjoyed for a bit. Breakfast buffet was great! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to those looking for a nice place to stay."
"6160",1,"While the property is new and has great potential, they also have the rudest staff Management I have ever experienced. I'm a platnium Marriott member and have never before been to a hotel that tried so hard to make me uncomfortable. I shortened a 7 nite stay to 1 nite and found another hotel in the area that was happy to have my business and make me feel comfortable."
"6161",2,"We had special reservation request at the time of booking and our request was granted over the phone - however upon arrival they did not deliver. Bedding had funny smell too :( I would recommend another hotel if traveling through Brownsburg....."

"6170",4,"Hotel was good overall. Good was okay. Desk staff, waitresses and bartenders were great. Would recommend it to a friend"
"6171",4,"Due to traffic in South Lake Tahoe preventing us from getting back to SF, we needed a place to stay over night quickly and conveniently. Inn by the Lake was easy to find and a great price! The staff was very friendly even at wee hours in the morning."
"6172",5,"First rate staff and facility. We were ending a long and somewhat stressful trip, and this was a welcome place to unwind and recover. The staff truly could not do enough to make us comfortable. What a pleasure to be in a place where they use metal keys! No lockouts with a magnetic key after 2 or 3 days, as happens in other places. Coffee in the lobby, a newspaper at our door in the morning, and a wonderful whirlpool and sauna to unwind. Also, a fine fitness room."
"6173",3,"For the price, the hotel was satisfactory. However, we had an extremely long wait at night for the shuttle van a the nearby Metro rail station despite giving more than 15 minutes (the requested amount of time) notice and making repeated followup calls. Also, the lone elevator was out of order throughout our 3-evening stay - making checking in and checking out more difficult."
"6174",5,"As soon as you enter this hotel you notice its not part of a national chain. This is a one-off, very hip hotel. Its not just the look and feel of the place, its the staff.

"6176",5,"Good: Bed was very comfortable, room was big enough, staff was welcoming."
"6177",3,"Bad: There is nothing on website or booking.com about the rules, and there are many, at this hotel, or that it is a quiet hotel. There is nothing about quiet hours starting at 11 on the sites either. Nothing about the limit to number of people that can visit you in your room. Nothing about the fact that when people come to see you they will be detained at the gate and not allowed to enter if you have more than 4 extra people you are visiting with in your room or the outside courtyard area. If these are the rules then fine, but we would NOT have stayed here if we had known this .Please put this information on both sites so that others do not have the same experience we did. A woman in the office was very rude and threatened to call the police for no reason. She was extremely rude and disrespectful and threatening during our stay. There are ways to communicate respectfully and calmly and this was not the case. I would never ever ever tell anyone to stay at this hotel. In fact, I will tell everyone I know to avoid going to this hotel unless they want to be treated rudely. I am sure that this woman in the office will respond saying she was not rude or threatening, but take my word, I do not ever write reviews and this is exactly what occurred and it made the stay unpleasant and uncomfortable and impossible to make plans to go out with friends. Ridiculous."
"6178",3,"The rooms were very spacious and clean however, very noisy being on the second floor. Kids jumping and running all hours of day and night. Front staff were very helpful and the breakfast was great. Shuttle (ART pay as you go or get a pass at the office) was just outside the door as was Denny's and Starbucks. Not the usual Mariott standard though. Older- small pool. --Hence the 3 star.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your review. I am sorry to hear that we did not live up to your expectations. Please feel free to contact me personally to discuss your stay in more detail so I know how we can turn your three into a five.Hospitably,Greg WilliamsGeneral ManagerGreg.WilliamsMarriott.com714-939-9700"
"6179",3,"The front desk had the most negative attitude I have ever seen in my entire life. He did not want to give us a room. He was not only rude to me but to other guest as well. Most of them were elderly which really bothered me. Because he was so rude we did not stay 6 days as planned,... More"
"6180",4,"The Red Lion is owned by the same corporation that owns the Vineyard Inn, also in McMinnville. The Red Lion is a perfectly adequate hotel. The rooms are clean and the housekeeping adequate.

"6181",2,"We took our two kids to stay at this hotel and we had so many undesireable problems during our one night stay, it really ruined the trip. My kids and I got stuck in the elevator which scared my kids to death and they were afraid to get back on the elevator. This was a problem since our room was on the 27th floor. We ordered desert from room service and only got half of what was supposed to come with it and the guy acted put out when I asked him to go and get the rest of the order. The jets on the hot tub were not working, the steam room was not working, and the room with the pool was all gross and really worn down. Our blankets had stains on them in the room and the toilet ran for 45 minutes after flushing which was really loud throughout the room. Housekeeping came and knocked on the door at 8am even though we had the do not disturb sign out. For a four star hotel it lacks the amenities you would expect. Internet was extra and we had to pay $15/day to park. The only good thing was the location and the view was great! Other than that, a huge dissappointment and not worth the money! The worst part was that no one even cared to ask about my stay when we checked out..."

"6186",2,"Never make a mistake and leave anything behind. The housekeeping staff will claim to not have seen it. There is no point of having a lost and found and this hotel....very disappointing for a Hilton"
"6187",5,"Good: The hotel environment, the staff went above and beyond to make our first trip to Boston better than we expected. Recommendations they made, help with directions, very friendly, didnt feel like a hotel, felt like staying with friends. Comfortable beds, cozy room, great food."
"6188",5,"Bad: The room was really small. With two large suitcases, we could hardly move in it. Good: Location, staff, bar with complimentary drinks"
"6189",5,"The hotel staff are very friendly and professional. They went out of their way to ensure that my comfort was their priority. Everything I requested was brought to me in a timely manner. They also gave me my privacy when I needed it."
"6190",5,"The only problem I have was their sensorize INNCOM thermostat for air conditioning unit to start-up. If there are not movement inside the room, it will not kick in..... sucks!! the trick is, you have to keep moving while sleeping to keep the AC running (LOL)...."
"6191",5,"Great dining, great amenities, comfy room I was super happy with my experience and I'll definitely be back, if not for personal travel then definitely for work events. Very much looking forward to returning."
"6192",5,"I visited my old neighborhood for a few days. The clerk recognized me from a previous stay when I checked in. Hotel personnel called a cab twice, with a rapid response. The computer in the business center wasn't working, so they printed my boarding pass at the front desk."
"6193",5,"Bad: Nothing, we had an amazing trip!. Good: The staff were all incredible! So friendly and helpful. The bed was like heaven to sleep on, it was so comfortable. I loved the size of the room and the bathroom. Very impressed with this hotel"
"6194",5,"The staff here was really great - courteous, helpful, well-informed. The room was comfortable and the kitchenette a real boon. Great value for money. If we're in the area we'd stay there again. Breakfast was nice enough, though a bit more variety would have been nice."
"6195",3,"Bad: There was vomit in the elevator and I had to tell the front staff to get someone to clean it up. Good: The room was very spacious and decorated nicely."
"6196",5,"Yes, it was convenient and our expectations of a Marriott property that were well met. Our room was spacious and very adequate, and in fact exceeded our expectations. Henry Jones checked us in with cordial and competent ease. The evening was restful and uneventful, the breakfast was exceptional. It is a 4 star hotel."
"6197",3,"Bad: Noise!!! in the room you can hear the noise from the corridor and from neighboring rooms."
"6198",2,"Before I booked this hotel I reviewed comments and rating which indicated I would be satisfied. Unfortunately, I was highly DISAPPOINTED! The hotel elevator had a bad smell, my air conditioner worked best at night, I could hear my neighbors conversation and to make my stay really memorable someone was banging on a hotel door. As for security the hotel has a door that is NOT locked and is located next to the elevator. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!"
"6199",1,"Pictures must've been old. I got what I paid for....somewhere to lay my head and shower late at night from long drive. Only good thing is they put us where it was quieter. Stairwell and walkways were not renovated and smelled like urine."
"6200",4,"Needed a bed that was supportive not lumpy. Too much constru tion noise outside. Need to go around building not to have to climb steps to get to room."
"6201",3,"Took more than 2 hour waiting to check-in to our room. Otherwise stay was comfortable. Have issue with slow Wi-Fi connection."
"6202",3,"Overall it wasn't a horrible stay. We wanted a suite since we were travelling with a baby and child. We were also going to disnleyland and wanted to be able to prep our lunches and come back to make dinner. The kitchens had everything you need!. The breakfast provided each morning was impressive. We first booked into a studio which didn't have a functioning bathtub so we very quickly got upgraded to a two bedroom suite which was extremely impressive. Loads of space. The first day our room got cLeaned the cleaners accidentally threw away my sons baby of baby food, formula and all his supplies. They say it was mistaken for garbage. After a mad dash to Target only a few minutes away is able to replace everything. They gave us a discount on our room. Don't know if I'd stay again as it was still a drive to/from disnleyland which was the main purpose of the holiday. It was close to shopping dining and groceries. If your going for baseball the field is across the road. People complained of trains but we were on the first floor facing the tracks and it didn't bother us one bit.Thank you for choosing the TownePlace Suites Anaheim for your stay. We are delighted to hear the kitchen in the guest room supplied everything you needed and found the complimentary morning breakfast impressive. Additionally, we are very truly sorry that your son's supplies were thrown away by accident. This issue will definitely be addressed in order to prevent this from happening again in the future, please accept our apologies. In addition, the hotel does offer an Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) shuttle stop right outside the front of the hotel and travels to Disneyland for a small fee it usually makes stops every hour daily during Disneys operating hours. The ART tickets can be purchased at our front desk daily and they are good for all day, so you can go back and forth as many times as you wish. We apologize if this was not offered to you upon check-in. Again, thank you for your review of the hotel as these reviews assist us in continuously looking at ways to enhance the stays of all our current and future guests."

"6204",2,"The motel is poorly managed and maintained. The smoking rooms reek of smoke and the non-smoking rooms are not much better. Expectation for a motel are naturally low, and this fits below average for a motel. The management was disappointing at best. Not worth your money or time."

"6212",4,"We stayed here for 3 nights in September. We arrived early and in a bit of a rush to get ready for a wedding. The hotel staff was very helpful in getting our room ready early for us. It's always nice when a hotel goes a little extra to help out, great customer service! We stayed in a standard king size room, which was spacious with a couch/sitting area.The room was quiet, we never really heard any noise from outside or from neighbors. There isn't a breakfast option, but there is a Denny's attached to the hotel and they give you 6 off per person coupons to use each day.We went to wineries in St. Helena and Oakville, the travel times varied between 20-30 mins. We ate dinner in Napa and it was just a few minutes drive to plenty of places. Overall, based on the location, price and customer service, I would recommend this hotel.Jdiddy78 - Thank you for such a kind review. We strive on incredible customer service and do everything we can to make sure you are satisfied with your stay. I'm glad we could get you into your room early to get ready for the wedding you were attending and we hope next time you're in our area you will come and stay with us again.

"6216",2,"The reception desk guy at checkin was reckless. The breakfast is extremely poor (some apples, cakes and coffee) uncomfortably served in every corridor of each floor of the hotel. Comfort is absent, there is no soundproofing in the rooms facing the street, nor in the back. The use of ear plugs is mandatory and probably insufficient to reduce continuous noise (day and night) from heavy duty air conditioning equipment of many commercial buildings surrounding the hotel. The Hotel offers extremely poor value for money. It is not a four (4) stars at all. Staying there was hard and exhausting. AVOID IT. Suitable cleanliness and location."
"6217",3,"Very convenient location to airport and cruiseport. Friendly staff (Henry, the porter is terrific). Comfy bed, Decent, ample breakfast. Good value.

"6218",5,"The Hotel was very clean hospitable. The entire staff was very couteous and prompt in responses to my needs during my stay.

"6221",4,"Bad: We had breakfast on two days in the hotel. One day (Sunday) the service was great - the next day it was very poor. While the hotel is quite central, the choice of restaurants very close to the hotel is not good. Good: Front desk staff were friendly and happy to give advice etc. Nice hotel with funky rooms. Room we had was a bit noisy at night - can turn the fridge off but still noise from air con or something else."

"6223",5,"We were in Key West September 18th thru September 22nd. We were supposed to meet another couple but unfortunately they couldn't make it because Anne- Marie broke her ankle shortly before the trip. So, we got to the Saint Hotel that Sunday after being dropped off by a taxi that we took from the airport. I would have never believed that something so beautiful would be behind the front doors that we entered. Once inside,the place was magnificent! The room, the pool, the bar/restaurant area were all so nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention how friendly and personable the staff was, particularly Gustavo Lobo and Maria. Gustavo was so helpful and friendly. He was so pleasant to be around. He went out of his way to help us, especially when we were at the pool. And Maria, she was so personable and a pleasure to talk to. Both were outstanding people! Wish we could have stayed longer! We mistakenly left a bag of gifts at the hotel when we had already left for home and after calling the hotel to see if we had left it there, it was sent back to our home within five days! Great place, both hotel and island!!!!!!!!!Thank your for this amazing review.Please be sure that I will share this comment with Gustavo Maria. They make us proud everyday by providing a genuinely caring service to our guests.In addition, we are flatted that you truly appreciate the unique decor and saintly vibe of our establishment. And it is true that the Saint is full of surprises and mystery...On the other hand, I am sorry to hear that your trip with us was too short, but note that we will always be pleased to have you here in Key West."

The restaurant was good and very accommodating."
"6235",5,"Bad: Everything was great. Good: Superior experience. Loved everything about this hotel. Very comfortable, well thought out and fun arrangement of the room, great shower and products, good restaurants, wonderful roof bar. Looking forward to the next visit!"
"6236",3,"Bad: The hotel is very outdated. Old rooms (we were moved because of an old airco that made a lot of noise), old elevators, tiny beds that should not be sold as double unless you like sleeping on top of each other, mediocre breakfast with very little healthy options (mind you, a 7 extra charge for a cappuccino is outrageous). Very basic pool area. All in all we would give this hotel a good 3 stars. Not more. Good: Location is ok."
"6237",5,"This hotel was probably the cleanest I've ever seen. Not only lobby, but pictures in room were dusted and clean! Every staff encountered was friendly and spoke. Only ate breakfast in the restaurant, but everything was great. Definitely will be returning during warmer weather!"
"6238",4,"Very nice hotel with a good breakfast. I wish the breakfast had more healthy food choices. Good location to freeway and easy to find.

"6241",5,"Bad: Although this hotel was a pet friendly hotel, guests are not allowed to leave their pets in the room unattended. If I needed to step out quickly, I would have to make other arragements for my pet. I seek out hotels that are strictly pet friendly because I know that a little barking isnt going to be an issue. Good: Cleanliness of the hotel, the polite and helpful staff."
"6242",2,"Bad: The room I booked was a non-smoking but when we got to the hotel, the gentleman at the counter said they didn't have any and have not had any available for several days. The guy then said that in order for me to get my money back, I'd have to go through the third party that I booked the room through. Good: Nothing"
"6243",5,"Everything was amazing! The staff was very helpful and professional at all times! It was a very welcoming atmosphere. It is located in a great area where everything(mall, restaurants, aquarium,museum etc) is in walking distance."

"6245",5,"This Hampton Inn is new and well-appointed, and seems to be a popular choice for people touring wineries, as our group was. There was a little street noise in my room, but tolerable.The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from front desk to housekeeping.Breakfast is of the standard you would expect for this type of hotel, with some reasonable choices and slight changes from day to day.It is not located in the center of Napa, so to go to most restaurants, you need a car."

My wife and I love it for it's ever changing, with new works of Art installed regularly. The property is centrally located, features a nice restaurant, Match, and is just across the street from FEZ, one of favorite eateries outside the hotel proper.

"6274",1,"We did not like this hotel. We left after one night. It was January in DC, (cold) and the heater did not work in the room. We called the person at the front desk but there was no one available to help with this. We called the front desk again for extra blankets which they did bring. We had booked a room with two beds and were very specific about this when calling for the reservation. When we got to the hotel there was only one bed in the room and no one could help us as the front desk was closed, only someone there to had out keys for late arrivals."
"6275",4,"Clean hotel, with exceptional staff. I would have given this hotel the highest rating, but unfortunately, they decided to put low flow shower heads in the rooms. My room, and other rooms, reported by friends who stayed here last weekend, all had the same complaint. They could barely rinse the shampoo out of their hair. It was that bad."

"6278",4,"We stayed in a room for 2 nights over Labor Day weekend. The place has a lot of character and it was a perfect place to spend time with my family.

"6280",1,"We stayed in this place 2 years ago. We were in the front building and paid about 70.

It was clean but dated broken furniture, very thin, chintzy towels, a paper bath mat. This year, we... More"
"6281",4,"We had two rooms on the second floor. Even though the rooms were listed as non-smoking it was evident the rooms had been smoked in at some point in the past. When we talked to an employee about the smell and were told the second floor at one time was the smoking floor. The smell was evident in both rooms. It probably was more pronounced for us, because the occupants in both rooms have never been smokers. Other than the smoking smell the rooms were fine."

"6287",5,"the hotel boasts one of the most comfortable beds I have had the pleasure of sleeping on. Also, a well appointed room all around."
"6288",1,"we didn't even stay there , we had friends drive by 3 days prior to our stay and they told us the place was in disrepair , screens out and filthy. we tried to call them for 3 days to cancel our reservations and they did not answer the phone. On the day we arrived we tried to call again and they finally answered the phone we told them our problems with the hotel and they yelled to late to cancel and hung up on us . They are now charging our credit card UGH you should take them off your site deplorable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"6289",4,"I stayed here on a business trip. The hotel is very clean, modern, odor and scent-free and well-decorated. The room was well-appointed. The shower was a bit weak. The heater was quiet. The exercise room was merely adequate but very clean. Valet parking is 18 daily."
"6290",4,"Overall this is a very nice hotel with well appointed suites. We were in town for a couple of family functions so we didn't use most of what was available in either the room or the other facilities that were offered by the hotel. A couple of comments an not really complaints are that the fitted sheet on the bed was put on the bed inside out and was not fitted very well to the mattress (it just looked kind of sloppy) and there were spatter marks on the wall next to the bed that looked like they could have easily been wiped away. The rest of the room appeared to be very clean. They were even steam cleaning the carpets in the hallways while we were there. All of the staff was very friendly. Each of the housekeepers we met in the hall always gave us a friendly greeting. The breakfast offered a good variety and everything seemed fresh. A buffet meal is offered Monday through Thursday but we were not there on those days to be able to comment other than to say what was on the monthly menu posted in the room looked pretty good. The hotel is close to the airport , about 10 minutes to Virginia Beach Town Center, and only a 15 minute drive to Virginia Beach. It is located in an industrial park and is conveniently located near numerous dining and shopping facilities."
"6291",3,"This is a new hotel right next door to the University of New Mexico. Very nice staff, clean and bright, with kitchenettes. No restaurant or bar but shuttle will take you shopping or out to eat. No safe in room, which is important to me. Lockbox available behind registration."
"6292",3,"After paying $150-160 dollars for one night I was totally disappointed that there was no free breakfast or free WiFi and on top of that you had to pay $16 a night to park, totally outrageous!  I have had all of the above plus free parking at cheaper but nice hotels."
"6293",4,"Bad: the room was not very big and a couple more hooks here and there would have been nice to hang coat, towels etc. Good: nice decoration, well located"
"6294",5,"Makeover was done well and not over the top. Dinner was good. Had the risotto. The chef has a mushroom obsession, so be forewarned. Breakfast was outstanding. Healthy and tasty choices and a warm, cheery staff. Personally, I would have preferred a firmer mattress, but still slept very well."
"6295",3,"I can only speak for the room I stayed in which may not reflect all rooms. I stayed in a two Queen bed room. The shower looked amazing, but when I took a shower there were two major issues. First, the water pressure or setting on the shower head was less than ideal. The amount of water spraying out was... More"
"6296",5,"We were very happy with everything. A Continental breakfast would have been an added value. We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for grear accommodations and staff not far at all from Wisconsin Dells!"

"6304",3,"The tube had mold in it. The breakfast was not at all what was told me me. I was unhappy with my stay."
"6305",3,"It was a good hotel to spend for only one night there. The Wi-Fi didn't reach very well upstairs. Although, I overheard the staff indicate they were working on it. The hot water for the shower wasn't that hot or didn't have the potential to get that hot which could be good in a sense. I filled up an ice bucket and left it out overnight. The next morning, I discovered a dead cockroach. I don't know if that was a fluke, but that kind of shocked me a bit. I don't think bugs in general are very good. The area was quiet which was important to get some good sleep. The free breakfast was really good, the staff was super friendly, and the shuttle got me to the BWI airport fast. Overall, I think it's a good place, but needs a few things fixed. I recommend on the contingency those issues are fixed."

The first room I checked into the ceilings had water stains, the shower walls were dirty and the final straw was when I pulled back the covers and what do I see, a caterpillar crawling in my bed. I was so disgusted when I saw that and when I called the front desk they told me I had to come down to switch rooms because they had one person on duty. So they put me in another room and there that had water stains in the ceiling and the toilet seat had stains on it and the room door had water stains on it. It was 1 in the morning and I was exhausted so I stayed that night but when I woke up I had bites all over my back so with that I checked out early and went to another hotel."

The hotel overbooks and apparently doesn't care.Dear Cinandyoung,Thank you for taking the time to express yourself about your experience with the Hampton Inn Suites.

However, there was no record of my reservation on 2nd trip (made through Expedia), and on recent trip overheard conversation with another guest experiencing the same problem, and his issue was not so much with the lost reservation as with the attitude of the hotel staff. My experience on trip 2 was similar but not quite as contentious. Most competing hotels do not charge for breakfast. This one does."
"6359",3,"Hotel is well situation on the road into Tupelo. It has plenty of parking and there are a couple of restaurants within walking distance which are good. Staff are helpful. Feels a little souless but it is good value for money and clean and tidy."
"6360",2,"There was a free breakfast buffet, but the hotel did not let us know the hours of it. When we showed up at 9:32, they said it closed at 9:30. We reserved a king sized bed and got a room with two doubles. They told us we were not guaranteed the bed choice that we wanted. There is no restaurant, lounge or bar as it says on the website. The shuttle was good to use and runs pretty much every 30 minutes up to 4:30 ish. If you need to return to the hotel after 10:10 when the shuttle stops, take a taxi. The cost was 7.50 and it was worth it. The nearest metro station is too far from D.C. Next time I will stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington again."
"6361",4,"Good: Love the location on the Chicago River. I liked the hotel before the Remodel. Dispointed no Christmas tree in the lobby. Bedding as always super comfy (I like Westin hotels). . I've stayed here many times and if the price is right will continue, however if your looking to walk into a hotel and get wow factor, this one is not for you."
"6362",4,"Spent 5 wonderful days at the Pioneer Inn. Great place. Loved the rooms and the outside deck, comfortable beds, coffee maker, great location and friendly staff. Walking distance to everything. Would definitely stay here again when visiting Maui."
"6363",4,"Bad: The bed was stiff and valet parking only. Wifi is pay only and didn't live up to the speed expectations as advertised. Good: The location is great, easy access to all of Fremont area with a short walk. Not being a giant casino you don't have to walk far from the car or through the place to get out."
"6364",4,"We enjoyed our stay except there were a couple of family reunions going on and the hotel was very full. We were on the third floor and could hear people taking outside all night.

"6369",5,"Bad: It was perfect, period!. Good: What's there not to like The wonderful staff at the Westin even guessed we were getting married in Vegas and, to our total surprise, when we got back to the hotel after our wedding ceremony, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolate-coated strawberries waiting for us. The hotel's restaurant, the Savona Bistro, simply has the best angus burger in the world! The location, for those of us who prefer to skip the hustle and bustle of the Strip: perfect!"
"6370",5,"Stayed at Club Quarters Downtown in April. I was initially disappointed with the size/layout of my room, so went right back to the front desk to complain (rooms are small but clean and staff is helpful). Virginia, the gal at the desk apologized and instantly moved me to a room with a view of Chicago River. Since it was my first visit to Chicago I asked Virginia about things to do in the area. She inquired about my interests and 10 minutes later I had tickets for Wicked, one of the hottest shows in town, dinner reservations at Vivo, trendy Italian restaurant in the theater district. Next day Virginia suggested a trip to the Art Institute, only a 10 minute walk from the hotel! , walk in Lincoln Park and a very pleasant restaurant for dinner with live jazz . What a great city! I enjoyed my stay tremendously. Will be back, thanks again Virginia!"

We ate in Caf Aria - amazing... More"
"6375",5,"A little pricey, however the location and service was excellent. Breakfast is not the best, at least as a Diamond level is complementary. I highly recommend this property, location, staff and rooms are excellent. Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay and we are delighted to know you enjoyed almost everything about your stay. We are currently transitioning our restaurant and trying out some new items and processes, please know that the breakfast service will improve as this is a main priority. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and do hope to have you stay with us again.Best regards"
"6376",5,"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly."

The beds were fine with extra pillows, the room had a flat screen TV and was quiet. The pool was medium size and the hot tub was fine. Good hotel."

"6386",4,"My room was spacious, immaculately clean, and pleasantly decorated. All the staff members were friendly, welcoming and efficient. My only complaint, and recommendation, would be an offered form of transportation to and from the air port. A nice accommodation would be to offer WiFi without cost."

The mattress on one was very old and sagging on one side. The other bed was fine. Would stay again but ask for a room with newer mattresses."
"6394",5,"Unfortunately, we had an emergency as soon as we walked off the plane. I received a phone call that my brother had passed away. When I got to the hotel and explained it to the front desk supervisor, Empriss, she was very compassionate. She did everything in her power to make our shortened stay as comfortable as possible. All the staff were very friendly and I plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Our room was awesome. Very clean. The view was awesome. We plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Thanks Empriss for being so kind and caring."

"6398",5,"We had a problem with our air conditioning in the air and they were unable to fix it so they moved us to a new room even though the hotel was completely booked. It was a great place to stay overnight and very close to the auto train. Great staff!"

Beds were comfy,pillows were too. Rooms were spacious. If I had one complaint it would be that the air conditioning blew right on to the queen bed closest to it. My husband fixed that by sitting a chair directly in front of it.We did not eat breakfast there but I'd recommend another hour onto that 9:00 cutoff ) Hotel is close to EVERYTHING.We stayed here and drove the 25 miles to mammoth cave and it was well worth it. You sure can't beat the 77 dollars a night for the service and cleanness of this hotel. Thanks so much Bay Mont of Bowling Green for making the last half of our mini Vaca awesome!"

It had two televisions, a fridge and microwave. The staff were courteous and friendly to a fault. This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. As to the extras - the hotel offered on site parking in their private garage. There was a great complimentary breakfast each morning, offering every conceivable food. Last, there was a 3 hour happy hour that offered free drinks (adult beverages as well!) and snacks - daily!

"6418",3,"We checked in very late to the hotel and asked if we could check out at 1 pm instead of noon and they said it was fine. I put the do not disturb sign on the door just to have the cleaning staff disregard it. They knocked twice at about 9:30 waking up my husband, and then proceeded to try opening the door. Since I had the lock on, they realized we were not ready for them to clean. They came back a second time an hour later and did the same thing. This time since my husband had woken up, I yelled out we're not ready! Do not disturb means do not disturb. I called the front desk and they said that they would talk to the cleaning manager. As we were getting ready, they knocked again and again. To say the least we ended up not sleeping well at all. This is unacceptable! What's the point of offering a sign that's going to be disregarded. I hope no one else has a similar experience."

At about 3 miles distant, it's about 1 mile farther out than the main 'hotel row' but still close to all the amenities - restauarants, grocery stores, etc.The hotel was showing its age a little but was comfortable, quiet and adequate. No complaints. Nothng to write home about either."
"6436",4,"This place is an average hotel. No casino, no room service, no glitz or glam. BUT it has clean rooms, clean pool w/free cabanas, a small nice restaurant, and nice staff. Location is next the Wynn and Encore close by Circus Circus. Across the street from a 24hr Walgreens and Dennys. I wouldnt call it a family place but its not bad for families. Some young and old partiers but not overly loud or obnoxious. If youre looking to go and dont need the pricey amenities then this place is right. It could use some updating but we werent in the room staring at the walls."

"6441",1,"I stayed at the hotel three nights. I was very disappointed by the level of noise at night. The doors were EXTREMLY loud. I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night. I was on the 25th floor. In addition to the noise, the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved. It wasn't easy. I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again."
"6442",5,"this is a fantastic hotel, i think it is a hidden gem located in the arts district of Phoenix. It is a fairly new hotel, very different, in a good way, from your typical hotel. The grounds are spotless, plenty of fun places to eat all within walking distance. I would not say it is within walking distance in the middle of summer in Phoenix to Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena. But the light rail has a stop right in front of the hotel and with your game ticket it is a free ride or for 4 bucks per person you can ride the light rail anywhere all day. Valet parking, only option, is 25 per day but they were great. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are the best part, very industrial but super cool. Concrete floors with plenty of area rugs.Neat shower and here would be the only complaints. The room is very open, the bath room only has frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room. Light from the bath room floods the rest of the room, especially on night runs to the bathroom. And has at least one other has said, you hear ALL noises coming from the bathroom which can be embaressing. We were in room 709, top floor king room with balcony and had an inflatable bed which I slept on (25 per night) It was a south facing room and had a great view of the city. 100 percent recommend this hotel, plenty of art all around. Just a fun place, the hotel is a destination, just like a Disney HotelThank you so much! We're so happy to hear you had such a wonderful stay. Hope to see you again soon."

The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay. We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around. Overall, I definitely recommend Hotel Zelos!"

The Marquis had rooms available, at a great rate and close to ATT (9.00 UBER ride). The hotel is beautiful and our room was immaculate. Staff is very friendly and kind. The only negative was on the day of our arrival, we waited on Mission Street for an hour to have valet park our car. The valet attendants were very apologetic and the desk clerk upon hearing how long it took, gave us an early check-in. I would most definitely stay here again!"
"6460",1,"The picture on their web site is correct but everything else is garbage. The bathroom had what looked like blood on the curtains. There was people outside drinking alcohol and being loud despite the 40 degree weather with rain. The stairway up to the 3rd floor smelled like urine. Strongly recommend to pay the extra money and stay at a different hotel. Would not take family here."
"6461",2,"I wish tripadvisor had 1/2 stars for our use because I would have given this a 2 1/2...3 is too high. This was our first hotel of 8 different ones on our Napa/Pacific Coast vacation, so I have a lot to compare it to. I have many other reviews on this site and I try to be fair when reviewing any property we've sayed at.Having said that.....It was my first experience at a Best Western brand and if this is a plus property I would not want to stay at a non-plus one.I disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviews...this is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area. Who are you comparing yourself with When comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range. You are priced as high as other properties but those properties have better/more amenities or are closer to vineyards, therefore it's not a fair comparison. It's like comparing apples and oranges...both fruits but there are many different qualities. Now back to the property....Don't expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name. This is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants. If that's what you're looking for, great book it, just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polution.Cons....The pool's capacity is 8 people. That should tell you something about the size. I'd guess it's 8X10' (that's probably a generous estimate). In my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial. The balcony we had was so closed in and dark. The solid front and sides don't allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs, not that the view was great....we looked out over Denny's roof and a traffic light. Oh, Dennys. sigh.....went our first 2 mornings. Ordered the free entree of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 bacon or sausage. Getting a hot entree I guess is impossible, the food was cold to the touch. My husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it. There were maybe 4 other parties in the restaurant at the time, not busy at all. The tea water was luke warm at best. Total waste of my time.Location...not your romantic getaway place by any means. About 20 to 25 minutes to the heart of Napa's wine country depending on traffic. In hinesight I would not have booked this hotel if not for the MANY( now suspicious in my mind)...reviews. I find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best. Really After spending 3 days in Napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries, I question the validity of these raving reviews.Pros....Yes there are a few...I promised a fair review and that's what I deliver.Shower....best shower head of any hotel. In fact I'm looking for one for my own shower.Cleanliness....our room was very clean. Small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet. Microwave, fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenience.Bed/pillows....very comfortable.So if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's a bit overpriced than book this hotel. If you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pool...don't book this property. At most I would expect to pay under 100 a night for this property based on it's location and lack of amenities. All the renovations in the world don't matter to me if they're not available when I'm there. They need to charge accordingly.We paid 537 for Saturday, Sunday and Monday evenings. I now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property. Oh well, live and learn.Thank you for your detailed review. First, we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property. Each hotel will have their pluses and minuses. We also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market. We actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its located 9 miles south of Napa, further away from the vineyards. On average you would have paid between 75 -200 more for your stay in a comparable hotel.All Best Westerns that have at least a 3 diamond recognition from AAA have the opportunity to be a PLUS property as long as they have a PIP( property Improvement Plan) in place. With the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete. There is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines. Our rates are similar to last years (before Plus) and we have added breakfast at Dennys and many more amenities. We never hide the fact that we have a small pool (12x 184). There are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other 3rd party sites. When a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool. We recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger pool.As for reviews, all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in Napa. We are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve. TripAdvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and ours.Thank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms, (we are an ultra clean property) our shower heads and beds. The shower heads are by Delta and Ive actually seen them at Home Depot. The bed that was in your room is a Cheshire IV pillow top by Serta. Thank you again for your review."
"6462",2,"The staff there were really good and the rooms comfortable. Hotel looks tired and its location good It was not too far from all things considered the likes of San Francisco, Napa Valley just to name a few"
"6463",5,"This place is in the perfect location a short stroll to all the action on Bourbon st and surounding areas (just a pity Bourbon st was dug up during our stay) the hotel had everything we needed ....very comfortable bed....nice clean bathroom plenty of towels and coffee and a great tv There's always next time to see Bourbon in all of its glory, just means you've got to come visit us again. Thank you for staying and we appreciate your business. See you for round 2!!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"6464",4,"Looked for an overnight on a long journey so just wanted a clean, quiet, comfortable room at the cheapest price available and this establishment met those requirements for us. It's an excellent deal at a very excellent room rate. Loved our king size bed and tv and robust wifi. Very quiet,quick check in, clean surroundings. Obviously the management is quite particular about appearances as this is unusual compared to other Red Roof Inns we have seen. We picked it because of the other reviews and are impressed that the management responds to each review. That's personal attention! Our check in person was just neutral until I began a conversation. I think a welcome smile and greeting should be a given, but that is my only recommendation. Overall, for the price this hotel is exceptional."
"6465",5,"Rooms are a bit small but you are in Chicago and don't spend much time in the room. Everything was very clean. Location was excellent. Close to restaurants and attractions. Pillows were wonderful. Fresh water and bottles available on each floor. Coffee and snacks in lounge morning and evening"
"6466",4,"My husband, baby daughter and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. You are in a great location near all the restaurants and shops and you cannot beat the price! The beds were not the best quality but were comfortable. I liked the fact there was a microwave and mini fridge in the room. It is not the fanciest hotel to stay in but it met our immediate needs and was very accomodating for a weekend trip getaway with my family. The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and courteous too. When we return to the area we will come back to this hotel."
"6467",3,"This hotel is very nice for Everett, looks new. The breakfast is amazing. However, the employees are not helpful to guests. When I checked in I asked for two queens, the lady at the front told me that she did not have any. I questioned why when I just made the reservation a few hours ago it showed available queens....

"6468",4,"This hotel was located right off the interstate. Signage at the hotel was not visible until after you passed it. The hotel staff was very polite and accommodating. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The only complaint I had was that it was a handicap room so everything was set very low. Overall, our stay was very nice and we were surprised with the size of our suite."
"6469",5,"Bad: nothing to complain about. staff very helpful. Good: bed extra comfy"
"6470",5,"Swiftly cleaned rooms just like most hotels. The staff are the best part about staying here. Shawn and Bianca N. are my favorites. Without hesitant, go to the moon and back to make sure you feel at home. It's hard to find that at other branches in Metro Atlanta. Bianca N. and Shawn are the Dynamic duo.

"6476",4,"We booked the room after purchasing tickets to see Paul McCartney at the US Bank Arena in Cincinnati. It was the hotel that was suggested on the arena website.

No better place to spend it then the Big Easy and we appreciate you allowing us to be part of it. Thank you again! Wayne General Manager"
"6486",4,"Bad: poor room comfort no room for clothes very old bath accesories high price."
"6487",4,"Very good value for the price. This motel is well run, clean, and the staff are very pleasant."
"6488",5,"I recently stayed the night at this motel and I must say this place was better than I expected. The rooms were very clean and very nice. The owner who is a 3rd generation owner treat me very polite. I felt like I was staying with family! He cares about his legacy and does his best to make sure you are safe and comfortable. Thank you."
"6489",2,"Dirty hotel room floor, the room was inside the building with the windows overlooking the hall and the rooms across the hall (how is this not a fire hazard!!!). The breakfast was cold, self-served a la carte in a dirty hall. Parking structure overcrowded. Awesome location."
"6490",3,"The location of this hotel is great for visiting Duke or getting around the area. This hotel has been purchased a couple times and has a great layout with lots of room for a great experience. The bar area is a nice area, the restaurant is a good layout as well. Bottom line is this hotel has not been renovated... More"
"6491",5,"The nicest hotel. It was very clean, staff was friendly, huge room, and pet friendly! Free breakfast, dinner, and 3 free alcoholic beverages per night per adult. Right beside the arch, and convenient parking."
"6492",3,"Spent 3 nights at the BW Pluss Inn at the Vines, located just outside of downtown Napa. Perfect location for what we needed. Recommend using Uber for transportation, so easy and fast. It appeared that there was plenty of parking available in the downtown area, but we preferred to walk and enjoy.TwinCityGrl - Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We are conveniently only 1 mile from Downtown Napa, so a quick cab ride away and you're in the heart of everything. We hope you come and see us again soon."

"6495",4,"Bad: The restaurant was less the expected. Food was cold and cleanliness thought-out the restaurant wasn't appetizing. For the prices and advertising it didn't come close.

A bit of a walk (but i did it with my 5 year old) into town for lunch. Free bike to take for an explore. I took my daughter to... More"
"6497",3,"Bad: The parking garage is so hard to find. I passed it at least two times trying to find it. You also can't self park, which is a hassle coming back from being out and about. You have to rush to gather all of your belongings, souvenirs, etc, because the entry bay to the garage will hold two cars at most. You can't dilly dally. Hope that makes sense. Only paid WiFi,which was a big bummer. The express snack bar/grill staff were very unfriendly. Every time I went to the buffet, the line to be seated was always sooo long. I never did end up eating there for that reason. Good: Near all of the Fremont Street Experience stuff."
"6498",3,"When I arrive we asked for extra pillows and were told they didn't have any because guests had stolen them. The bed was comfortable. Bathroom large. Room was generally clean although the fans hadn't been cleaned and dust/dirt was hanging off them. Towels were so thin and old as to have my wife suggest that next time we bring our... More"
"6499",2,"First off there is no parking, valet is your only option which would be fine if it were a better hotel. Our AC didn't work, maintenance had to come reset it three times. Very inconvenient at 8pm, 11pm then again at 1am. The pool is a joke, it's more like a bathtub. And the amazing breakfast they advertise is no better than a Continental at most hotels. Over all it was a huge disappointment."
"6500",5,"The Central Loop Hotel was in a super convenient location for walking to the Art Institute, restaurants, and shopping on State Street. I arrived by train, and it was just a couple of blocks walk to the hotel. The manager and front desk staff were very helpful and nice. The room was pretty basic, but clean and neat. Felt safe and secure. The only downside was the hotel practice of placing a deposit on my credit card for any incidental charges. I really don't like that practice. I noticed that I was not the only one, another hotel guest was complaining about it at the front counter while I was there. My hotel charges were paid in advance as a birthday gift from a family member, so I thought I was all taken care of, and then found out that I had to give them my credit card just in case there were any charges in addition. Of course there weren't any additional charges when I checked out. I just don't like having to do something like this."
"6501",4,"Awesome staff - excellent on providing customer service"
"6502",5,"Awesome! We had a wonderful time. The hotel have a amazing breakfast every morning! Definitely will stay again."
"6503",4,"When we 1st arrived the staff was extremely friendly. The check in was swift as far as check ins go but they checked us in to an already occupied room. OMG! Can you imagine entering your room family in tow and there is someone sleeping in the bed. I was frighten, embarrassed and angry. We returned downstairs and the couple was already calling down about the intrusion. The staff apologized profusely and immediately gave us an empty room. Needless to say I had a hard time sleeping that night worried that someone might walk into our room but that never happened. The rest of the stay was worry free. The only other issue was the breakfast time. Breakfast at the Hyatt Place was from 6:30am-9am. That's awful early for people traveling with kids or on vacation. I'd like to take a moment to thank the staff. They were courteous and friendly especially Rosalind and Adriel. Thank you for a nice stay."
"6504",5,"spacious, clean room, relatively close to boardwalk, a 7eleven across the street... not prime location (you feel that Atlantic city is not in its best days), but good value (even with the charges for parking) as it is walking distance to boardwalk/beach and the room is nice"

"6506",3,"Well, we arrived at our hotel and I had done the pre-checking in thing (like we can do for airplane seating etc) I had chosen my room and everything was good.

"6507",5,"Good: Courtesy, friendliness of employees. Perfect location."
"6508",4,"We arrived late (after 9pm), so we called ahead to let them know. This was no problem and the front desk woman was very courteous. Our room was spacious and included a refrigerator and microwave. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. We felt the hotel was a good value for the price."
"6509",4,"I have stayed at this hotel for the past several years and find it to be well kept and clean. Staff are friendly and accommodating. It is located in a quiet part of town though remains close to a major road for easy access. Would recommend this location to others."
"6510",4,"We stayed here for my husbands graduation 12/11/15. The hotel was nice and so was the staff.

The elevator was just a little slow so we took stairs most of time since... More"

"6516",3,"Hands down definitely the worst Best Western I've stayed!!! Don't know if previous people or cleaning person left balcony door open But the room had at least 5 mosquitoes buzzing around, fortunately I managed to get 3. A slight musty odor like a old wet towel throughout room. Luckily we only stayed 1 night if it weren't for the ocean view we would have literately fought for money back! So if your on a budget this is it!!!"

"6529",1,"I asked for non-smoking room but doubt very much that the room assigned was non-smoking. It literally stinks. The surrounding of the property was poorly maintained, hardly swept. The outdoor pool area was even worst. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned for weeks. The garbage cans were overflowing from the day I get there. The following evening, it was still the same way. This should be rated as .5 star."
"6530",4,"We wanted to stay away from the city in a smaller place, so we ended up in Sausalito. Friendly welcome. We had a room on the ground floor, which was very clean and spacious.

"6536",4,"We stayed at the Best Western Plus during our long weekend trip to Napa. It was perfectly fine for what we needed, a place to sleep after touring wineries! The room was very clean. We were on the second floor by the pool (not sure if all rooms face the pool) and it was good. Only had one instance where a group of loud girls were in the pool area and it was definitely loud in our room, but thankfully it didn't last long. Overall a quiet place. Got vouchers for Denny's next door, easy and fast breakfast before our days. I saw some reviews mentioning traffic due to the location, but it was always an easy in/out for us. Would definitely stay again if in the area, since it's a great place to rest after a busy day!"
"6537",2,"Stayed overnight after seeing Rascal Flatts concert. Clerk had personality of dry white toast. Not mean or disrespectful, just not particularly friendly. The elevator smelled like a sewer pipe, as if a sewer main had busted and was discharging into the elevator shaft. Room was decent size but bed horribly uncomfortable. Lumpy and right side sagged so bad my wife almost rolled out of bed a couple of times. She is a petite girl, so it wasn't weight or anything, just a worn out mattress! A couple of extra pillows would have been nice, but didn't ask for them so can't really fault the hotel there. The window to the room was literally the wrong size (too small for the opening) so a nice COLD wind blowing into the room all night that the heater struggled to keep up with. End result was room was too hot or too cold, and the heater dried out the air so badly trying to keep up with the cold blast from window, we both had bloody noses in the morning. Not impressed overall. Will pay the extra 20 bucks to stay at the Courtyard next time!"
"6538",5,"We couldn't have made a better choice. The Westin was the full package and provided more than we could have hoped for. Many thanks goes to Sarah Locke for doing such an amazing job with the planning and time that went into our wedding reception. We highly recommend!"

This hotel had everything around it, especially if you have kids to entertain..bowling ally and ice rink in the back, resteraunt next door with very good breakfast and a ice cream shop with a up stairs popular resteraunt within feet from the hotel. Oh, the Lake, just across the street, very, very NICE!!!"
"6556",3,"The hotel was apparently renovated about 10 or 15 years ago, but hasn't been very well maintained since then. The condition of the rooms is clean but run-down. The attached restaurant serves pretty decent Indian food. The biggest complaint is that there was a plumbing issue with the hot water not running in the shower. The second is that the check in process was excruciatingly slow. I don't know if I'd stay there again, given the plethora of other inexpensive hotels in the area. If you do stay there, check all of the amenities in the room and insist on a different room if something doesn't work."
"6557",4,"Spent 1 night at this property stopping through on the way to NYC. The room was spacious. The bed was comfortable with numerous pillows and higher end linens. The mini fridge came stocked with complimentary bottles of water. We had drinks and appetizers in the tavern. While the food was great and the pours were generous, the bartender was less... More"
"6558",5,"The resort was one of the most gorgeous places I have ever stayed at. Everything about the place was top-notch. The room was beautiful and equipped with everything you would need in the full kitchen and bath. The room opened up to a large balcony where we could eat our meals. We were given a gift basket with laundry detergent... More"
"6559",4,"I've stayed at this hotel twice. Each time was only for one night, however, so I can't comment much on housekeeping other than to say my room was always clean and presentable upon each check in. This last time I did have an issue with the outlets on the desk next to the televison, so I had to make my tea by my nightstand with the provided coffee maker. It would also be a great convenience if they had a mini fridge and microwave in each room. But other than those minor issues, I can't complain and would return. The cookies are delicious as well."
"6560",5,"Bad: Only thing I would have changed is the climate control. It did not go anywhere near as high as I would like for it to go. Maybe it was just my room, but definitely could have been cooler. Good: Got more than what I expected from this hotel! They let me choose what floor I wanted to be on, which I've never gotten from anywhere else. Location is PRIME. Fremont Street is right outside their doors! The room is just like any other average hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. Michael Ovalles was very helpful in showing us around. He also helped us get our player cards and a complimentary deck of cards to enjoy our stay!"
"6561",4,"Nice location, nice front desk service."
"6562",4,"The room was basic but clean and comfortable. I asked for a ground level room because I have a bad knee and would've had difficulty with stairs, especially taking my dogs out.

"6564",2,"I want to first say that this hotel is in a prime location. You are steps away from the trolley pick up for city place and clematis. Upon arrival I thought the hotel was very nice. We were greeted by one of the owners and she was very helpful. Our room was located on the 3rd floor and we did... More"
"6565",5,"We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu."
"6566",5,"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel on New Road. It was convenient to many places we wanted to go. Rooms were clean, quiet and the beds very comfortable. Great breakfasts and the staff was very hospitable."
"6567",4,"Hotel staff is extremely nice. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet. I would recommend having non-pork items available on the line (turkey bacon/sausage or even veggie patties). Room on the small side, but valued for the rate. Had a family of ants visit - reported to the desk and was taken care of. Dockside Grill for evening dinner was good. I would... More"
"6568",5,"Bad: No soap available, just shower gel. No hot water for three days. Good: Super room 10 on third floor. Loved the squishy soft duvet. Excellent staff tried very hard to help us with many things. Even had help signing up to Uber for the first time! Made good use of the pool."

"6572",5,"Bad: No breakfast option and it was pricy to park every day. But nothing major. Good: Very modern and trendy property with very clean and spacious rooms at the heart of San Francisco. We had fun in the games room and enjoyed a drink at the bar after a long day of walking"
"6573",1,"Rats running around the parking lot. My husband and I saw FIVE rats running around the parking lot and one jumped out a trash can. I don't do rats I am always been afriad of rats and I wasnt expacting that. I didn't feel comfortable staying there. Management was'nt helpful at all. I was there for my son's graduation from the Navy he had completed boot camp. So this was an important visit. We had to find another hotel at night and I had to pay more money.No one was helpful to us at all."
"6574",4,"Hotel staff was very friendly. Everything went great."
"6575",5,"We stayed on the second floor near the elevator. We loved our room and the location. They serve an excellent breakfast everyday and wine and cheese each afternoon. The courtyard is lovely place for breakfast and Indigo is within walking distance to historic Charleston. The staff was friendly and very attentive. Would definitely return."
"6576",5,"We stayed here as a perfect halfway stop on our way to and from a ski trip to Park City, Utah. You enter into a lovely lobby. Our room was not only spacious, but had one of the largest bathrooms I've seen with private toilet and separate tub and shower. The free drinks, and if you arrive early, good snacks... More"
"6577",4,"The hotel offered many amenities that were beneficial to us for the reason for our stay such as, comfortable rooms and breakfast. Upon arrival a round trip service from the hotel to stadium was being offered for 20 dollars a person. We immediately jumped on the deal due to being unfamiliar with the area, as well as my wife expecting our first baby. She is restricted to the amount of walking she is to do and we didn't want to walk to and from the metro station in the dark. Our driver never picked us up at the drop off location, when speaking to him he misled us to where we were to go to meet him, he hung up on us and a police officer, and shut off his phone. We didn't get picked up until an hour and half after the game by the boss of the company. The whole ordeal was very frustrating and unorganized. We did get half of our money back from the second driver/boss of the company. When returning to the hotel the staff didn't seem concerned with the mishap. I don't think the hotel hired a credible company to provide shuttle services to their guests. Any guest should be cautious about using an outside shuttle service provided by this hotel."
"6578",2,"Bad: The restaurant was closed for a refurb and as a result we had to eat our breakfast in the lobby on our knees. We had tiny plastic plates and plastic cutlery and a poor food choice . I was not informed by booking.com that this was the case . It was not the service we wanted for 675 dollars for 2 nights!!. Good: The room was good"
"6579",3,"We stopped here for two nights on the way to Niagara falls and while coming back. Nice hotel. Clean, comfortable, big rooms with a very comfy bed and basic amenities. Price was okay too. Location was good too. Overall we had a pleasant stay in this hotel."
"6580",4,"Good place overall except the carpet in the room was coming loose and bubbling up, great location nice indoor pool, big room, the wifi was extremely slow, the hiking trail was nice the playground needed a lot of work, beds were very comfortable"
"6581",4,"Bad: Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 4.30 (advised it would be ready from 4). They didn't have a two queen bed room as booked so we had to take a king and a roll in bed as there were 4 of us. Good: Good location and a good price"
"6582",5,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during our visit to Virginia last year. Check in was easy, front desk staff was friendly and helpful and spot on with their recommended spots to eat.

"6585",1,"So this hotel is pretty nice to look at, and the staff was very friendly, however, we entered the room (very small) and continued to look at the room. We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean, however in the box spring of the bed, there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring. We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room, however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean. Thank you Front desk for your efforts to accommodate, but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotel.Guest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously. We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company. Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity.

"6587",4,"Worked OK for an overnight stop along I-57. Convenient to I-57, although internet-generated directions can be a little confusing, but local resident had no problem finding. Nothing fancy or too modern, but clean. Didn't have time to check the pool or other amenities."
"6588",5,"We had a 3-day business planning retreat here. We wanted an environment different from the average, away from the day-to-day, where we could unplug, unwind and connect fully with what is important. This was perfect.

When we left again....saw notice from a public... More"
"6590",4,"We made plans last minute so we were worried if this place would be nice. We were very happy with our experience! We were 1 hour early for check-in but the staff said it was okay. Check in was quick and fast. We parked across the street at the garage. Rooms were clean, we had requested top floor which they accommodated! View was PERFECT! Exactly what we wanted! Rooms are a bit dated like the carpet and the bathroom but very clean and plenty of towels. Room had a flat screen TV which we never even turned on because there was so much to do! Free hot breakfast was great the next morning. The staff is EXCEPTIONAL! Very friendly, they always smile. Very efficient! Every time we needed something, they went out of their way to meet our needs. I will definitely visit again just because of the family friendly atmosphere and the super attentive staff!"
"6591",5,"Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel."

The location and hotel didn't feel like we were in Phoenix, and we live here!We're so happy to hear you had a wonderful time! Please visit again soon."
"6603",2,"2 things are mandatory for a good hotel stay. 1. that the place is clean, and this was. 2. that the bed be comfortable and this WAS NOT!! It was a struggle to not roll into the divot that was in the center of the mattress. Both my husband and I had a terrible nights sleep."

Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel.

"6608",3,"On Monday while watching a news program, the light went off. I waited 10mins nothing happened and I called the front desk and I was told something like: light went out in the entire New Carrollton area. That was not their fault but not to have adequate preparation and provision in case of such occurrence is unacceptable. I was unaware when the back up power came up because my room never had light until the New Carrollton light came back. Business should be business. I paid for a full service, not spending some moment in darkness. Thank you."
"6609",4,"Besides the rude customer service, overall it was great. The rooms are spacious and we had no problems at all. Everything worked well. The water park passes to Noah's Ark and Chula VIsta is a plus. We went to both water parks. Also the pools at the hotel are good. My god son enjoyed the area for kids outside."
"6610",4,"Bad: Room size. Good: The close proximity to TD garden"
"6611",4,"Bad: There was NOTHING we disliked! The room was small but that was to be expected and the two of us were very comfortable there. The room size and the narrow hallways gave the entire place the European feel... nothing wrong with that, right. Good: 1. Outstanding location! Close to the T, the airport shuttle, historic churches, Public Library (also an attraction in itself), Prudential SkyDeck, the amazing Newbury St. with all the shops and restaurants... I could go on and on. 2. Excellent staff - attentive, helpful, understanding, flexible... overall very pleasant without being over the top. 3. A small place that felt like home, without that big corporate hotel feel. 4. A good continental breakfast that never ran out of any items. 5. Free WiFi that ran very well. 6. Reliable cooling/heating system. 7. All the small details such as nice toiletry items, modern plumbing, detachable shower head, hairdryer, iron, a huge mirror... Thank you, CharlesMark! We hope to stay there again."

"6617",4,"My boyfriend and I stayed here based on the reviews on this site, which I can usually depend on--and again, they were right!The hotel is very nice inside, the location is prime, and the staff is one of the Best we have ever encountered, and I have travelled worldwide. The rooms are smaller, but if you think about it, what is missing is the vast expanse between the side of the bed and the main window, and who uses that Anyway!Great things that made up for the smaller size (and my boyfriend is 6'2 and had No problem with the hotel at all!)are the small kitchenette, with coffee maker and supplies for morning java, the bathroom and it's nice shower, and the bed was very comfortable! Ask for a room higher up and enjoy the great view! We were not disturbed by any noises, nor elevator troubles, in the least. There is also a nice desk in the room, for your laptop. Once more, the staff here will do everything in their power to make your stay wonderful!We Will be going back ,and we will be staying at CQ! There is also a small cafe in front of the hotel that had a very good breakfast, and looked busy at night with casual cocktails and Italian food that looked great.Remember that you are not moving in for good, and once you get in the room, you will find you have all the space you need!"

"6619",3,"Bad: I don't really know why this hotel has such a high rating. It's decent, but definitely not worth 3* and 300+ I paid for the room. Nothing in particular, but just the entire feel and look of it was more in the 2*, 150-200 range. Also, there were some road works taking place just outside the hotel at 7AM that produced insufferable noise, so I wish I had known that before booking."

"6626",2,"I stayed there for a week on a business trip. I wasn't looking for anything special, but The hotel seemed rundown. I didn't realize that that the corridors were external, which isn't a huge problem, but they were painting them while I was there making it inconvient to get around. The room and bathroom were shabby as well. What really did it for me though was when I packing to check out on the last day I found a small broken piece of glass tube under the bed. Curiousity got the best of me so I took it the training class I was finishing up and asked a police officer in the same class what looked like to him. He said that it was a piece of crack or meth pipe."

"6634",2,"The hotel is decent but lacks pizazz. Its kind of stuck in the 70's. However its still clean, functional, and a budget friendly place to lay your head for a night or two. Dont expect a lot for what your paying. Your not going to pay much so your not going to get much."
"6635",2,"The ceiling was dripping water onto my broken toilet. The place is in desperate need of renovations. It was clean as it could be for the condition it was in."
"6636",2,"Although the hotel is in a convenient location and was inexpensive, the housekeeping is not acceptable. Sheets were not changed. Towels were not replaced. Sink was not clean. In addition, there were sketchy people in the lobby and hanging around the premises. Did not feel safe or comfortable. Would not stay here again."
"6637",4,"The price was right and the location can't be beat. The hotel lobby and room were spotless and the staff could not have been more helpful. The gym was also very clean and the equipment was state of the art. Will definitely become a repeat customer at this hotel. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the sink leaked onto the floor creating a very minor nuisance. Highly recommended, though!"

"6639",3,"Great breakfast buffet each morning. Definitely adds value to the price. But otherwise, not a great stay. I think their cleaning crew must be understaffed. One day they didn't take out our trash or give us bath rugs or hand towels. The six of us in a two bedroom suite shared towels and used a washcloth -- a washcloth! -- for a rug. The next day we didn't get any maid service at all! At 6:00 pm, we went downstairs and asked for our own towels. The little market store downstairs was sold out of bottled water for two of our five day stay. Not having water after a long day of city walking was a real disappointment. And there is no easy market or store within walking distance, so we were chugging tap water. Yuck. My son got sick one night, so we hoped for ginger ale or Sprite or something to settle his stomach. Nope. All they had was Mountain Dew.The location across from Lake Union was pretty, but not convenient for downtown activities. We had to wait up to 20 minutes for an Uber driver during peak hours. That was poor planning on my part to book here, but I had no idea that Uber would be so difficult. Despite the challenges, we did have a decent stay. Our two room suite was spacious and comfortable. And again, the breakfast was really fantastic.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your recent stay with us and providing your honest feedback. On behalf of our team, I apologize we fell short of meeting our expectations but most importantly yours. It is guest as yourself who help improve our hotel and provide better service in the future. I apologize for the inconvenience of your downtown travels in Seattle. However, I am glad you were comfortable in our luxurious two-bedroom suite. Respectfully,"

"6641",3,"The location was fine since everything on the island is a short trip away. But the room smelled of spray disinfectant and was extremely small it didn't even have a closet although it had everything else it was jammed in there. Actually everything was jammed in, they did not have a separate area for the breakfast it was set up in the lobby which is small as well and which you had to walk back and forth to four separate sections to get to as people are checking in and out and leaving for the day. Even the hallways were small and you had to squeeze around the cleaning carts or move them. I will say they use every space available they can. The pool was nice and the staff as well although it seemed disorganized. I didn't hate my stay but i felt i was overcharged."
"6642",5,"My husband and I stayed here over the weekend to celebrate my birthday. The hotel was packed but that didn't seem to affect the staff. They were very friendly, attentive and accommodating. The breakfast in the morning was wonderful-full of choices and whenever they got low on something a staff member came and changed it out. I will be staying there again next time I vacation to Charleston!"
"6643",5,"Such a great experience! We traveled as a hockey team, and the team at Hyatt Place was so accommodating! First, my room wasn't ready (at 10 a - check-in is far later), so they got out some cold breakfast items for my son to keep us occupied until it was ready. The rooms were clean, modern and spacious. At the... More"
"6644",5,"Bad: The breakfast was good but there could've been more variety to it. Good: The location was amazing! I also liked the fact that the hotel was very cosy."
"6645",4,"For being located in the city of D. C. the price was reasonable. My biggest complaint was that I booked ahead of time through Expedia and paid using my credit card. When I arrived I noticed that they gave AAA members a discount and asked if I can get the discount being that I am a member. Of course, they said sorry but you already paid for the room and there is nothing we can do about it. Gotta love it when computers tie the hands of people from being able to do what's right. I should have been able to receive this discount but, the computers would not allow it. This is wrong. In the past before modern technology they would have done this. While all this was happening there was a gentlemen next to me that complained about a price variance due to not receiving a AAA discount and the staff did an over-ride for him because he did not pay yet. I'm not sure I can use services such as Expedia again if this is the result. I hate feeling ripped off and I definitely was in this case so no more Expedia for me unless I get my discount back."
"6646",5,"The staff was excellent personable and very helpful. The hotel is top quality, flat screen TV, internet connectivity, and just 3 months old at the time I visited."
"6647",4,"Nicely renovated, large suite. Clean, roomy and comfortable."
"6648",5,"I loved my stay VIP service all the way. I didn't want to leave. I can honestly say I will visit again. I give it 5 stars"
"6649",5,"I traveled with two of my sisters during a week and a half road trip. We were coming up from Savannah and were staying two nights. As it was August it was very warm out.

Walls were nasty, I just really can't... More"
"6652",4,"If you're looking for a motel to spend a night at cheap it is a fairly good deal. The room was clean, but it had a slight order. Tthe bed covering had some burn holes and tears. The eating area is somewhat small and breakfast selection was very basic. The bottom line: If this is a stop off on the way from point A to point B and you want to save some money for your vacation you might give it a try. If you are real particular about where you stay, then you might want to try another motel. considering the money I saved and service I received, I would stay there again"
"6653",4,"Bad: The hotel bathroom should be remodeled as the bathtub looks quite old. The drain gets clogged easily, and the basin tap handle looks like it is about to fall apart. No free WiFi. No fridge. And even no coffee-maker/kettle. Good: Good location with a few minutes walk to the Mob museum. The hotel is located in the heart of Fremont Experience. Both northbound and southbound bus stops are just beside the hotel building. Besides, the staffs are quite friendly. The buffet was satisfactory, and the price is cheap due to the 10 off for guests every meal."
"6654",4,"Bad: On one day our room did not cleaned until after 6.15 pm despite several messages. The front desk response was that the hotel was busy and it was not unheard of for rooms not be done at 6pm - and offered an apology as did housekeeping. We were more than a little surprised to hear this...most hotels are busy mid summer. We have experinced delays but nothing like this. We had to reschedule dinner appointment. As we were only there for 2 nights it was rather disappointing. Good: Location and facilities."
"6655",5,"One night stay before flight home. All we needed and with a 12 noon check out - good room, clean comfortable. Also used the food service for meal upon arrival - good value, tasty made to order plus the inclusive breakfast.

A great place to start and get information is the wine and culture center in canandaigua. .also they have a tasting room.. not bad prices for it... More"
"6659",4,"We booked this particular La Quinta because its location off I-10 was convenient for our long roadtrip. Great price on hotel website, and room was new and clean. My son liked the pool, and it was nice to have complementary waffles and fruit for breakfast. Staff were friendly and helpful. There were a couple of shady characters hanging around outside, but we never felt unsafe. I have a feeling this area might not be the best part of town."
"6660",4,"The Aria is a stunning hotel that is in a great location near the Strip. We loved the room as it was spacious and modern and the view was fantastic from the 30th floor! The casino is huge and has a variety of games and tables, however, they are quite expensive to play. We mainly played on electronic versions of... More"
"6661",5,"The art deco decor and large floor to ceiling windows created a festive yet zen atmosphere. There was a hiccup upon check-in with the system being down but generally speaking, service was great and staff very friendly. After check-out I realized I was charged for something incorrectly and Chris addressed it immediately and was able to correct it without hesitation. Great location and intimate feel came with friends but will revisit with spouse.Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had a great stay. We appreciate the feedback as it's very important to us and we will be sure to commend Chris for resolving the issue you encountered quickly and efficiently. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and look forward to having you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"6662",5,"Don't believe the negative reviews we stayed at this hotel for four nights and looked forward to coming home each night. My girlfriend used to work at a hotel and she thought the room was typical of hotels costing 50 more a night. Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and free shuttle to the metro, which is half a mile away (takes about 20 mins to ride to Capitol). We heard sounds from neighboring rooms only once, and the noise was faint. Only complaint was the room service - it took 75 minutes to arrive but they gave it to us free. Reading other reviews, we were a little worried about the neighborhood. Don't be. Yes, it's not the best part of town but those who call it a ghetto are way off. We walked to the metro once (and back at night) and we always felt safe. This is a great way to see DC and not spend a ton at a downtown hotel."
"6663",3,"Bad: Room and bed were tiny - not even a queen bed. Bed took up most of the room. Breakfast was coffee and a bunch of cold bagels. Bathroom was also tiny. Not worth the exhorbitant price at all. Good: Location was good."
"6664",5,"This is an awesome hotel! The staff was very nice and extremely helpful. The hotel is modern and beautiful. The location is excellent, right across the street from the Space Needle. The roof top terrace is lovely day or night with an amazing view of the Space Needle. Easy to get to downtown via a 2.25 trip (each way) on the Monorail to Westlake Center. From Westlake Center, it's just a 10 minute walk to Pike Place. The hotel also provides shuttle service within a mile.Cheryl H,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout Seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences.

"6665",5,"Good: I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet"

"6670",4,"The hotel was average. It's conveniently located close to bwi where they offer a shuttle service to and from the airport (that means no paying to park) hotel staff was so so. Not very friendly. The shuttle driver was cool even at 4am."
"6671",4,"The pool is huge my kids love that it is seven foot deep so they can dive in. The hotel is being remodeled and the room they have redone are quite nice, the beds are very comfortable. The staff is also friendly and welcoming."
"6672",4,"We stayed here when we came to Anaheim to watch Angels games two nights in a row. It was the perfect location. It is across the street from the stadium and there are a few places to eat that range from Carls Jr to a nicer sit down restaurant (The Catch I think). The hotel provides a continental breakfast which was a pretty standard hotel breakfast. It's always convenient when traveling with kids. There was barely any room to sit and very busy. One morning I ended up finding a table and the next morning I took our food out to the pool and sat out there with the kids which was very peaceful. The pool area is small, but enough to keep the kids busy for a couple of hours. It was a nice temperature, not too cold. They also loved going between the pool and jacuzzi. The room slept 6 of us, but was not spacious. It was nice to have the 2 queens in separate bedrooms and a living area, so if someone wanted to rest, they could close the door and others could watch TV in another room. There were 3 TVs. The beds were OK. The bathroom was small considering the room slept 6 people (not 6 adults, but doable with a mixture of adults and kids). The kitchen area was more than adequate to bring some food with you, prepare it and not eat out every meal. The decor is updated, but some areas of the room felt worn. The room was clean and we had excellent service at the front desk.Hello Snulie,Thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott.

"6695",3,"This hotel is located across the river from the Trump Hotel which makes it walkable to Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and possibly even Navy Pier. Rooms are nice, sleek and clean but SMALL. How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a late checkout Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it Well, this hotel charges 35 for late checkout! We had a situation, where my mom, a senior, was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing. We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and didn't return to our room until 3:00 am. When we woke at 11:00 am, we were hoping they'd allow us a late check out so we'd have time to get some food, especially since she is diabetic. The hotel would make no exception or allowance. We had to hurry and pack. We'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up. Because of this insensitivity I've had to lower the rating of the hotel."

Due to bad weather, I was able to just walk to the restaurant attached and have an excellent meal."
"6703",5,"We staid only for one night and this probably was the best option in town. Rustic but gemtlich as we germans say. The owner is a nice guy and we had a great talk with him about some families from Conrad. We highly recommend this place if you go to Conrad."
"6704",5,"We were taken aback by the staff, especially Jalan who since we walked in took care of us. We felt like royalty! They secured a bottled of champagne and treats for our 22nd wedding anniversary ... so very kind! The hotel is lovely, a boutique stay with a Hilton flair. Its modern but not over the top. Very clean and very comfortable with a great rooftop bar. It is not in the French Quarter so beware we actually liked that as we know NOLA well. Surely a destination to be considered. Thank you for taking the time to write this wonderful review of your anniversary celebration at our hotel. We love to hear back when we not only meet but exceed expectations. Jalan is certainly a rising star on our staff and has been commended for his efforts in taking great care of you.

"6706",5,"Everything was great. The workers at the front desk are all nice and very helpful. All the rooms are suites and they are all very clean and spacious. The best thing about it is the proximity to Angel Stadium. We went to go watch the Giants play the Angels for two days and the hotel is literally across the street from the stadium. They even let you choose what you want from their continental breakfast when you check in and have it ready for you to pick up in the morning in the lobby. There are also places to eat very close by and although we didn't get in (not enough time) the pool it looked clean and like a nice place to relax. I will definitely stay here again whenever I am in Anaheim, great hotel for a great price."
"6707",5,"The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again."
"6708",5,"Nice room with privacy barrier when traveling with children. Larger room than normal with separate bathing from vanity. Comfortable beds with freshly cleaned spreads! Free breakfast in the morning. Unfortunately, 19 parking. ( The only drawback.)"
"6709",2,"Although the hotel was close to MDW, the hotel was pretty old. The carpet in our room was pretty bad, it was sticky and needed immediate replacement. The furniture had seen better days. I didn't think it was worth the money we paid. The hotel certainly needs TLC in many areas to keep it competitive. They were charging 8.50 for breakfast. They could have included that in the price we paid for the room. That is not a big deal but the carpet is. The noise level was also high as it is right next to the main thoroughfare."
"6710",5,"My wife and I stayed here on our first couples getaway when we were dating. We are back for the holiday as a quiet getaway.

"6718",3,"I seemed like the Hotel is under going renovations. The road in front of the property is under going serious construction. One of the exterior doors to the Hotel never did not open from the outside. The air conditioner in the room was so noisy I did no sleep well the first few nights. The first day the maids failed to clean the room. We had to go to the front desk to get clean towels."
"6719",4,"Overall, a comfortable stay."
"6720",4,"Bad: Provided breakfast is just bagels and doughnuts + tea/coffee. I'm not sure how that qualifies as continental! Beds are very small but OK for a relatively small couple - would be uncomfortable if you are much over 6 feet. Rooms are small but that's the only way you are getting a room at this price in this location. Good: Location is excellent (we walked everywhere including from Boston Back Bay station to the hotel with our bags - it's a 10min walk), staff were friendly, rooms are small but reasonably well appointed, hotel and rooms were very clean."

"6724",4,"You can walk to Arlington Cemetary the Iwo Jima Memorial from the hotel, as well as to a supermarket restaurants. The hotel shuttle was very reliable, running in the morning afternoon Mon-Fri to from the Metro station once a day to the supermarket. The suites were large, with a pull-out sofa in every room. It wasn't the most comfortable, but it was great to have a separate bedroom area full kitchen. The only thing I was suprised at was the fact that we had to lift our heavy luggage up about 5 steps to get to the elevators. There were no ramps. From the parking lot, it's a straight shot through the front doors of the main entrance. I saw some people arrive by bus, which dropped them off on a side street. They were dragging their luggage up about 30 stairs to get to the parking lot! Instead, they could've just walked around along the street in front of the hotel to get to the lot. Going up all those stairs with luggage did not look fun!"

"6729",5,"We stayed here for one night on our way to Northern Virginia with our son's and their families. This is one of the better hotels we have stayed in with the free drinks, free dinner and free breakfast, it can't be beat. This hotel is super clean, allows pets, and is in an easy on and off from I-77. There... More"
"6730",3,"This Best Western is located on the beach. Some cons are: the parking in front of the hotel is quite tight and spaces limited and the pool is located across the street (there is also a parking garage across the street.) This hotel is located where you can walk to some restaurants and beach shops but it's also a bit away from the heart of things as well. The free continental breakfast was adequate, had hot cold choices, a couple fruit juices, coffee, milk and some fresh apples and oranges to offer. The hotel staff was amazingly nice and accommodating, going above and beyond --in my opinion. This isn't the newest of hotels with aging decor and a semi-cold fridge in my room, but the price and location were perfect for this trip!"
"6731",4,"Excellent service. Had a late arrival and checked-in okay. Hotel did a great job with shuttle service for KC Chiefs fan to playoff game in Houston."
"6732",4,"This is a pleasant family hotel. Although the weather was warm, the pool was closed, which was annoying. It's next to fast food places. It's right on the highway so it's a little noisy outside but the rooms are OK. You can see the lake across the highway but the rooms do not have lake views."
"6733",5,"The Troubadour is a hotel that is clearly run by seasoned professionals. It is modern and beautifully appointed. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The room was spacious, the bed incredibly comfortable , the bathroom had every amenity and the largest and nicest shower imaginable. The rooftop bar was lively, had a great view, drinks and DJ. It is a short walk to the French Quarter. Do not hesitate to stay there!Thank you for taking time to complete a review of your recent stay. I'm thrilled to hear you had an enjoyable stay. We know you have a lot of choices when selecting a place to stay and appreciate having had the opportunity to impress you. Thank you for the recognition and recommendation, we look forward to seeing you again soon.WayneGeneral Manager"
"6734",5,"The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs."
"6735",4,"We just stayed here one night on a birthday trip to Napa. My friend picked this place to stay and for the it was nice. A little more upgraded than most Best Westerns. Bed was comfy, sink area a little small but not a deal breaker. Had microwave and iron in room which I appreciate.They do give you a discount coupon for the attached Denny's Restaurant. Skip if you can, not really worth it.Next time I would stay closer to Napa itself but for a night, this place was just fine.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay."
"6736",5,"Located in downtown Little Rock, I found myself only steps away from restaurants and other activities offered by this city. For frequent travelers, it's on par with what you would expect from the Hampton brand, added with some very friendly and helpful staff. Definitely my pick in Little Rock in the future."
"6737",5,"Manager Orlando was very accommodating on the phone and allowed us to have a great time in downtown Atlanta. The hotel is in a superb location and is easy walking distance to the most touristy sites in downtown ATL."
"6738",5,"Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable."
"6739",1,"First of all, I'll warn you that there are no refunds, no exceptions.

"6741",5,"We stay at this hotel several times during the year while visiting family. Always have a peaceful and comfortable sleep. The bed is very comfortable and the breakfast items are a nice touch for a quick grab and go if you don't have time to go to the restaurant next door. There are many different restaurants nearby also. Usually the road noise is very minimal. Great choice for travelers, close to everything in the Napa Valley. Shirley A - Thank you for taking the time to write such a kind review. We do our best to make sure everyone's stay is as pleasant as yours was. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you - Genafer, Director of Sales"
"6742",4,"Bad: Delays in checkin, no liquor license yet!. Good: Location room"
"6743",4,"We stayed just one night on our way back to NJ from the University of Maryland, and decided to take the evening in Baltimore. The Embassy Suites is always a nice stay for us, particularly with the buffet breakfast. Hotel lodging and comfort were great, and the price was more affordable than staying right at the Inner Harbor. Rooms were comfortable and spacious, and the ground and interiors were classy. Would definitely stay there again for a Baltimore vacation. As you would imagine, this hotel is geared towards airport travelers and executives, and a shuttle runs continuously between the airport and hotel. I would suggest having a shuttle also running to the Inner Harbor, which would broaden the hotel's base of travelers by offering an easy way into the Harbor (and avoiding having to take the Light Rail service). Otherwise, everything was great."
"6744",4,"Room was nice and tidy, absolutely loved the sheets. They were incredibly comfortable and I didn't want to get out of bed. Wish there was more variety in the vending machine area though. I only had coke or sprite to choose from on my floor."
"6745",5,"I very much enjoyed my stay. The room was excellent and the location perfect for my business trip. It turned out to be very near many tourist attractions as well. I give special kudos to the staff - I left a shirt in the room as I was trying to make a hasty exit to get to a meeting and the staff was wonderful about getting the shirt and shipping it back to me. All in all, a wonderful stay!"
"6746",5,"Definitely went above and beyond for our occasion. Even sent up a special dessert. We have many fond memories of staying when it was the Hyatt and was not disappointed. Great job. Especially at check in..our clerk was amazing. He made all details of our stay comfortable. Thanks."

"6752",3,"This hotel is exceptionally priced for what it offers (e.g. complimentary breakfast, well equiped fitness center, wireless internet), but the price is due to its terrible location and accessibility. Very friendly staff too, but getting there safely is the challenge."
"6753",5,"Good: Great location just off The Strip down from The Flamingo easy walking distance to main attractions."
"6754",4,"I was blown away by the lobby and halls. Our room was less than spectacular as it was a hotel tonight booking and probably was the last room in the building overlooking an alley. Even so the small room we had was well worth the money and did the trick."
"6755",4,"Desk clerk was very helpful when I called at the last minute to get room. She was very helpful at check in. A storm was coming and she even printed out a radar map to show us when the storm would hit."
"6756",5,"My wife and I were spoilt silly by sheer hospitality. We had a wonderful stay, my only issue was that we could not be given a hard bed (mattress) so I experienced back pain throughout our stay."
"6757",5,"We had a great time. When I booked the Hotel I booked it for the inside pool for Spring Break for my grandchildren. I didn't even realize all the other perks of this hotel for kids. Inside pool, inside playground, inside game room and mini golf. I would totally stay here again for kids it was great."

"6761",4,"On a visit to San Francisco my husband and I decided to take a quick over night with friends to Napa and ended up at Inn at the Vines. The hotel is a little older but in pretty good shape. Our room was large and clean enough! The location for us was good. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning.The poor girl checking us in was alone and pretty darn busy. She was great though!! We would certainly recommend the hotel for anyone staying a night or 2 in Napa!!Thank you for your review and compliments on our hotel.Come back and see us again."
"6762",4,"Arrived at the Hotel from Dulles airport at 15:50 the young man on the reception who introduced himself as B was at once friendly and welcoming and made a good first impression. The hotel although a bit dated is clean and easy to get around, the room I was in was spacious and with the benefit of it's own kitchen a blessing after a long day sight seeing. A shuttle bus runs frequently to and from the hotel to Rosslyn Metro station and the driver helpful and friendly, although if the weather is nice a walk down the hill is to Rosslyn and the Metro is no more than 10 minutes. All in all a good hotel and location with easy access to Washington DC."
"6763",4,"This hotel based on reviews was a little iffy when making the reservation but decided to chance it. Glad we did it is fairly new, rooms were great and comfortable.

"6772",4,"Nice hotel, with good rooms and beds. Location is not really close to Riverwalk and it would take you a good 15 min walk to reach there. Alamo is relatively closer. There is nothing much right next to the hotel. Breakfast, checkin, checkout and the reception staff were all good. Breakfast staff could have been a bit more courteous."
"6773",3,"Bad: It was hard to get into the parking area because of traffic (an event was going on) no coffee pot in the room. I like to sit and drink coffee for and hour or so before doing anything for the day. I'm not paying 3.00 per cup of coffee. Other than that it was ok. Good: It was a beautiful hotal"

"6777",5,"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room. The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs). My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area."
"6778",5,"Very accommodating. The rooms were clean and the staff was very pleasant. The very was definitely one of the best. Made me and my family feel welcomed the second we got there. Beautiful facility and very well kept"
"6779",4,"This is a newly renovated motel. We had a clean room with courteous staff and a nice breakfast. They even mailed me the pills I had left in the room! A good place to stay when passing through the area."
"6780",4,"I'm a neat freak and this hotel felt comfortable. Very spacious too, we stayed in a resort view room and it has a living room with a t.v. and a sofa bed room with a separate t.v. and closet. The room comes with a washer and dryer too which was a plus and they use Aveda products for the bathroom."
"6781",5,"Good: Upgrade of the room, because of our honeymoon!"
"6782",5,"Everything was sold out in State College for Garth's concerts and the Inn came up as available...what an amazing find!! I'll be making the drive now each visit, just to stay there! The Inn is wonderfully decorated and I so enjoyed browsing all the books. Breakfast was amazing each morning. Thank you Stephanie and team!!"
"6783",2,"The room was supposed to be a non smoking room yet the smell made it clear that previous patrons had smoked and more than just cigarettes. There was a cigarette burn on the wall above one of the beds. The overall condition of the room was disappointing especially when it cost 80.80 for a one night stay."
"6784",2,"The bed in room 305 had to be the worst bed I've ever slept in. NOT HAPPY. not impressed. will not be staying there or will do my best to avoid another holiday inn express."

"6786",3,"Lots of activity under way to improve the hotel. They have some new eating places coming in soon. The new Game Place sports bar had great food and drinks. The bartender Angela was friendly and helpful.Rooms are spacious and quiet. Beds were comfortable when you are finally ready to crash. My room was clean and no complaints about maid service,I used the shuttle service to return to the airport and this was a nice savings over a cab or rental car.Downside / upside is that this is a LONG way from the strip. You can walk to a few places. A few gold courses are next door, with Angel Park and Badlands on either side. I would not want to stay here more than two nights without a car to get out more.The players club had ZERO points gifts except in small or medium sizes. How is that possible. F minus. Many employees were friendly and helpful. Room rates were very reasonable compared to the Strip."
"6787",4,"Great over night stop, truck and trailer parking, pet friendly, easy access. The art in the hallways looks like they bought it from the discount pile at a poster store in the mall. It's really quite an amusing bunch of wall art."
"6788",4,"very happy with convenience of hotel and the shuttle provided to and from the airport. Slamming doors and yelling kids at 5 am was sleep disturbing but the only problem. Great German restaurant down the street"

"6790",4,"The hotel was very clean and front desk service was fast and friendly. The room was a bit small with only one chair.

"6792",4,"The Club Quarters is a good hotel to stay at if you are looking for a place to stay with a good price and within walking distance to clubs and the Toyota center. We were able to take a short 10 minute walk to the Toyota center at night as well as bars and clubs nearby. The only complaint I would have is that parking is not free as the hotel itself does not have a parking area. There is a parking lot nearby where you can pay for meter parking but need to insert cash into the meter every so often which is tricky because you can forget. Valet price wasn't bad, 25 for 24 hours and you can come in and out as many times as you want with no extra charge. We chose this option and it worked out great because we didn't have to worry about our car. Hotel has free water bottles downstairs, a keurig machine in the rooms, a kitchen area with a small fridge, stove and microwave and glassware inside the room, and a coffee machine in the lobby."

However, the immediate environs of the hotel are quite pleasing. There is an international supermarket in the plaza across the street. Quite a convenience."
"6821",4,"Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel. The location alone makes this hotel worth it. Its located right by the Chicago river 1 block from the Magnificent Mile. There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel.The rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small. The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted.Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested.Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there.My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive. Its well hidden. If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far. As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms. They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time. Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair. Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again. It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible. They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city.All in all a great expericen for the price."

"6827",5,"My husband and I stayed at the Benson for Memorial weekend as our friends were getting married. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The room was a bit small but otherwise great. Very clean and super comfy Tempurpedic beds. Also centrally located- we could walk to everything!"
"6828",4,"Good central location for the area. We were there for a wedding and all the guests were able to be accommodated. Staff was friendly and helpful. We had a fun after party as well. Lobby is a bit small but adequate."
"6829",5,"Good: Location! Free breakfast and cocktail hour added plus!"
"6830",4,"This was our first stay at a Home 2 Suites hotel. The hotel was very modern, clean, and well kept. The entire staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. The breakfast serving area could have been a little bigger to accommodate all of the individuals who were dining at the same time."
"6831",4,"This hotel was really nice, but it has very poor signage and is right up against another hotel. The wifi was poor and the breakfast was horrible. I ended up buying breakfast foods at walmart and ate in my room. The room and the interior of the hotel was excellent. Very clean, and quiet. Bring your own pillow though if... More"
"6832",5,"Did not take long at the check in counter. The room was clean and a great shower with lots of water pressure. Food was very good for comp breakfasts. Stayed only one night. Have used Hampton in the past and will again. First time in this location, but glad we stayed."
"6833",4,"I stay here about 1 week a year when I in Nashua for work. The hotel is nice, includes a breakfast buffet with fresh fruit, made to order omelets, etc. Rooms are clean and well appointed although it would be nice if they had a mini frig. Hotel has a nice pub for lunch or dinner and drinks."

Clean rooms, comfortable bed and great service is what we strive for. Come back and see as again."

"6839",5,"Very nice hotel. Staff was very friendly, rooms were very nice and comfy, continental breakfast was good. Only thing that I would change would be to have some benches or seating outside. All in all nice motel."
"6840",5,"Everything was perfect"
"6841",4,"everything is fine except footstep above the ceiling can be noisy"
"6842",5,"I had no complaints and would stay again. I have stayed at several different Hampton Inns and this was as nice as any others I've I stayed. The staff was friendly, the room was nice and clean, and breakfast, although the typical Hampton fare, was great."
"6843",3,"The hotel is in a great location and the staff were excellent - very friendly and helpful, and organised a very early check-in which was great. However, for the price we paid I think it is only average - the rooms are clean but very basic. The hotel breakfasts are very basic, only very average and overpriced. As mentioned there... More"

"6846",1,"My family decided to stay here the night after spending the day at Virginia beach before heading home. The hotel seemed ok and clean and all was well until about 1am. A couple arrived in the room next to ours and were fighting. It got so loud I had to call the front desk and while I was doing this the women was screaming that she was being beat. There was a lot of banging around and the manager along with someone else came up right away. They proceeded to call the police but when they got there the man had already left. This was a very traumatic experience for my wife and kids and management did not even try to talk to us about it. This was not an experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel. I know some things can't be controlled but management should have followed up on this. Based on this experience I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
"6847",4,"Very nice play to stay, clean room, nice pool area, friendly staff, nice location. Everything about this hotel met my expectations, including the price. After a nightmare stay at a motel in New Richmond, Wisconsin, I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
"6848",1,"This hotel badly needs updating. The first room the faucet didn't work, the room they moved us to you couldn't open the door, the next room had two double beds instead of a king which I had reserved.

"6851",5,"Everything about our stay was great. Traveling with 2 young children can be challenging but we felt welcome and comfortable at this hotel.

"6853",4,"The staff at this Comfort Inn is wonderful. They are always very accommodating with us and help us out. We've stayed here more than once but always in room 201. It's a very nice room, it's clean, and the beds are comfortable. The included breakfast is quite good for a free breakfast and my nieces love the waffles! My nieces also love their pool! It's pretty average size for a hotel but big enough for us. Marzoni's is just across the parking lot which is great for us because it is our favorite restaurant in the Altoona area."
"6854",5,"The rooms were comfortable, clean, and quiet. The breakfast was fine.

A big plus to the hotel was friendly, helpful staff, both at the front desk and the breakfast area. There are... More"
"6855",3,"The hotel was clean and neat. Staff was friendly. But it looks like a work in progress. The floors were basic concrete with no tile or carpet, the room only came with a small rug. The toilet was clean but didn't work too good. The fan in the restroom was very loud and about to fall apart because of some missing screws. The hot water took a very very long time to start coming out. And lastly, there was a big water leak in the last day that came from the ceiling in the restroom. We woke up to find a soaked floor and soaked toilet. Breakfast was good and the lobby was really nice. The pool area and the whole outside was nice as well. Now they just need to fix the rooms so they can match the rest of the hotel. I wouldn't stay there again only if I knew the rooms have had good work put into it."
"6856",5,"Room seemed to be brand new, very clean, and was perfect. was completely 100 and more satisfied. The staff there was so friendly and nice I wanted to mention their names. Lindsey, Amanda U, Baylie, and Alex Patel........they were amazing."

The bed was very confortable. the rooms were very clean, and it was nice that they had a wall thermostat to better regulate the rooms temperature. the HVAC was quiet and the staff was very helpful.

"6871",5,"I was there to visit my daughter and her family, that live in Porstmouth, VA. The hotel is very close to them. I was able to bring my dog. The hotel staff allowed me to leave and leave my dog loose in the room, which was AWESOME! They even assured me that if he got loud, they would just call me. The room was a studio..plenty of room for us both. The hotel was refurbished a year ago. They offer breakfast each morning, waffles, fruit, cereal, etc. They even have snacks, drinks, for sale. Plus anything you might have forgotten! Love this place! I will go back regularly!"
"6872",2,"Bad: assigned an accessible room without being told. tried to book room direct with hotel but was told tat they could not match thebooking.com rate (even though we were starwood members.. ). Good: bar area"
"6873",5,"We had a family reunion and everyone had a great time. The lobby had a lot of room with comfortable seating to hang out as a large group. An attached parking garage and 3 block walk to the light rail, plus many restaurants pubs within walking distance made for an easy home base for our young to old group."
"6874",5,"Once we finally found it we enjoyed the stay. Your sign is hidden behind Applebees and we couldn't find it without stopping and asking for directions. We got there early and our room was ready at 11 so we were able to check in right away. Room was really quiet and the tv was a good size. Will stay there again."
"6875",4,"My girlfriends and I stayed here for two nights so that we could see a performance at the Majestic theater. The double queen suite was perfect for our needs, with a nice living area with comfy couch, ottoman, chair and big screen TV. The beds and pillows were heavenly! I highly recommend this hotel for sightseeing in downtown San Antonio."
"6876",5,"We enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Although the pool hours didn't accommodate our after 10 P.M. arrival, the bartender still served us the length of time we needed to relax after our long journey. Rooms were great, although we wished for an exhaust fan in the bath. 3 people needing showers in the morning necessitated this feature. Overall, we were pleased with our experience."

She was quick to let me know how proud she is of her staff. She should be, they are wonderful. From the time I checked in, her entire staff made me feel welcome and very comfortable. Emily in the restaurant suggested a couple of her go to specials, and she was right on. Delicious!! The hotel was in immaculate condition. The rooms are large and very quiet. Sleeping on the road can be difficult. No problem here. I slept like a baby.

Room was a good size , my only complaint was there wasn't a mirror in the bedroom area , only by the bathroom. Great location, within walking distance of everywhere we needed to go to. The Livealoft program is a great free concert series at most aloft's, so happy you got to enjoy that bit of local flavor while here. Be sure to check for concerts in your area at your local aloft.

"6888",5,"Stay in the Blue Room. It was really cute. The Inn was located right in town so we were able to walk everywhere. The cutest little lady owns the place. We had stawberry shortcake for breakfast and spent the whole time at the beach. the price was very reasonable as well. The owner even let us borrow her beach chairs. We are coming back for their blueberry festival. it is supposed to be HUGE."
"6889",3,"Bad: Rooms felt old. We had a reservation for 4 but not the towels, cups etc for 4. Hair dryer was weak and insufficient. Bathroom counter were way too low and came to my lower thigh. Killed my back. Brushing teeth, shaving etc. Decor was showing its age. Good: Location near the commons was good. There's a small playground nearby which is good for those with youmg kids."
"6890",4,"excellent location near convention center. friendly, willing staff. not a true luxury hotel in terms of the room I received, but a comfortable clean room, I didn't really need any more than that. After all you're here to visit San Francisco, not the hotel."

"6892",5,"We stayed three nights at the Springhill Suites Nov 19-22. I was greeted by very courteous staff at check in, a kind gentleman started the lobby fire for us and the facility was clean and most comfortable. The most impressive person there was DeCalvin Wilson. He served each morning at the delicious and varied deluxe continental breakfast and even came and cleared away our dishes in the expansive dining area. This young man went out of his way to care for the customers - I felt I was at the Ritz Carlton (or at least what it would be like if I could afford it). Give DeCalvin a raise and promotion. No he did not solicit such praise - I was just impressed and wrote his name down. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here."
"6893",5,"Really nice room...comfortable king bed, great ocean view from balcony on 5th floor. Bathroom was little tight to go in shut door. Love the afternoonsunshine coming in through glassed-in hallway leading to rooms. Access to boardwalk beach was quick easy. The breakfast was way more than continental delish.

"6907",4,"We only stayed one night, but we can see why it would be good for an extended stay. The room had a small kitchen and work area. We prefer to stay at hotels that offer a full breakfast, which this one didn't but that was okay, we just went to the Waffle House down the street. This is not a complaint by the way. We were mainly looking for a hotel close to Interstate 64 for one night and the lack of a full breakfast was not a big deal to us. The staff were friendly and courteous and the room was clean and adequate for our needs. We would stay here again if we are ever in the area."

The location is great -- I walked to World of Coca-Cola and some good restaurants -- and the free parking helps make it a real bargain. The place is clean and well maintained and t staff was pleasant and helpful. I walked both day and night and never felt in danger though I did have to deal with a couple of panhandlers. No surprise there."

Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all .

"6930",1,"Rafael (manager) likes to look into peoples windows even with the blinds closed to see what you are up to while you are in your room. I appreciated the safety of his intentions but, I don't believe I ever signed up for that part of him being a manager. Joseph (male maid) likes to go into peoples rooms while they... More"
"6931",5,"In DC at the beginning of the Labor Day weekend, and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The service was fantastic from the moment we arrived by taxi, through check-in, and culminating in a turn-down service that was just the extra special treatment we loved. There were special weekend events like a family movie with tons of snacks, wine and cheese tasting in the lobby, even a magician for the kids. I loved it. The kids loved it. I would recommend highly and definitely stay again when in the DC area. The metro is right outside the front door!"
"6932",4,"Embassy Suites are always beautiful, open spaces and comfortable rooms. This one, across the river from the National Mall, didn't disappoint in it's appearance and cleanliness. But I'm confused why the room service policy doesn't include timely pick-up of used dishes. We saw numerous trays of dirty dinner dishes on the hallway floors 12 to 15 hours after delivery. Seems it would be much cleaner and less (potential) bug-attracting to collect those dishes early in the morning, before breakfast is served. This issue seemed tacky to me, its the kind of thing guests shouldn't have an opportunity to observe. Instead, guests can't help but walk past lots of dirty dishes on their way to breakfast. Equally, dining room staff needs to be sufficient to keep the tables clean at the same rate of guest arriving for breakfast...or at least give us a place near the kitchen to bus our own trays! I saw lots of folks trying to find a clean table, while lots of other folks were trying to clean up after themselves. Aside from this issue, the staff bent over backwards for every question, request or incident."
"6933",5,"This hotel was cheaper than the other near-BWI hotels that were available when I needed one. Yet, a bit to my surprise, it was a really nice place. The only small negative is there is only one computer and printer for printing boarding passes."
"6934",5,"My wife and I stayed at the Ritz Carlton for three nights while attending a wedding held at the resort. The wedding was beautiful and the staff and scenery was top notch. We attended the wedding during a busy time in our lives and yet we were totally relaxed upon entering the property!"
"6935",5,"Great location . The employees are always eager to help and truly seem sincere! they have an excellent breakfast area, My room was very clean, and Air conditioner really worked great. I would come back for a stay for sure!"
"6936",4,"Good: The staff at the place is extremely friendly.Paradise Restaurant buffet good selection, good food, and reasonable cost."
"6937",5,"The hotel looks very high class without breaking the budget. Staff are very friendly and have kind attitudes towards guests. They are very accommodating and are a pleasure to be around. The rooms are very nice and clean, not a spot on them. The personal touch of the cleaner was a welcome reminder that the staff are more than just... More"
"6938",3,"My complaint is that after you check in, they take you over to their concierge desk and proceed to try and sell you on a time share meeting. And hey, if you want to pay for a room and then spend two hours of your time at a time share meeting, more power to you. I don't. And I tried to be polite about it, because I believe in treating people in the service industry as you want to be treated. I understood it was part of her job and politely told her that I wasn't interested. And the first lady seemed cool about it. Then what seemed to be her supervisor came over and offered me free stuff to go to the meeting. I still said no. She proceeded to get really patronizing. By the fifth time I'm saying no, I start to not feel so polite. And when the same woman calls me up the next night in my room to try and pressure me again into going to this meeting, I just had no patience for it. I loved the room. I loved the size and the cleanliness. I hated that they repeatedly badgered me about a stupid time share meeting. I didn't pay for a hotel room to be pressured to buy a time share. If it hadn't been for that, I'd have had no problem being a repeat customer. I don't like being pressured into something I say no to. And now, a month later, I just got a call from the hotel group, again trying to get me to go to a time share meeting. Luckily, the guy was way more understanding and only made me say no once."
"6939",1,"I have never had such a horrible hotel experience! I booked straight through their website, not a travel website. The room I booked was a 2 bedroom suite that clearly stated it has a king and 2 double beds. We arrived late after a long day at Busch Gardens on the day after Christmas. Check in took awhile but that... More"
"6940",5,"Everything about this place is great. Location, within walking distance to some of the best restaurants, seafood to Tex Mex, with a very good pizza place right inside the hotel. There are 2 24 hour grocery within a 5 minute walk. The staff was fantastic, rooms were clean and quite."
"6941",5,"The staff, room, experience in Chicago for being the first time was great. I would do this again in a heart beat with my family or friends. research your plans before anything you do. Thanks for the help trip advisor also other websites."
"6942",3,"The experience was ok. It was nice hotel . Staff was pleasant."
"6943",5,"Stayed two nights. The room was very clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable. Slept like a rock! Used the gym facilities in the morning for a great workout followed by a nice continental breakfast. Great staff! Great Hotel! Great stay!"
"6944",5,"I have stayed at several places for both business and pleasure over the last 12 months and this was one of the very top stays. I was VERY surprised that a small town had a place of the stature. I was staying for my Granddaughter's wedding but will be back very soon. It was GREAT."
"6945",2,"Cheap comes with a cost. You must be desperate to stay here. Drug bust the day we stayed. Nice owners but wow. Everything is old, broken, stained and smelly. Never again. It is not worth the little money they charge."
"6946",3,"The hotel was perfect for a place to lay your head. Conveniently located."
"6947",5,"Stayed one night while in the area on business, and I was blown away by the front desk staff's dedication to superior customer service! Unfortunately didn't get their names, but the lady and gentleman that checked me in were kind, prompt, and told me several times that if I needed anything to call right away. Denesha checked me out in... More"
"6948",2,"I was verry disAppointed. With the house keeping service, no towels, bed wasn't done cause we left a a pant on the bed, no cofffe......i hated.....i hate to ask for everything when is suppose to be done w out asking"
"6949",2,"Air conditioning unit whined like an airliner approaching a landing-annoying plus wasn't very efficient! Mattress's have seen better day's ( or in this case - better night's ) need replacing. Our room was on the Interstate side (back of hotel) VERY NOISEY- actually thought at one point that the window was open. Ironing board leg's were severely bent - broke in half when attempting to close after use - which was difficult to use since it wouldn't lock upright!"
"6950",5,"Loved our 3 day stay..room very clean (356) very quiet..comfy... Right on the beach steps from the lake. Kayaks (extra charge), surfboards (extra charge). 2 swimming pools. Continental breakfast included. Convenient Rite Aid right across the street and a Safeway a couple blocks walk. Relaxing here is easy."
"6951",5,"I cannot say enough about this outstanding hotel. Everything was top notch! The valets and front desk went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable, easy and memorable! La Jolla is so beautiful and upon our return we will only stay at this amazing property!"
"6952",1,"Save your money- this was the worst hotel in which I have EVER stayed!!! We should have just turned around and left when we pulled into the hotel parking lot and saw a police cruiser sitting out front. The hotel stay went downhill from there. The side lot of the hotel is poorly lit and we did not feel safe parking there. There were ants in the shower, the linens were ripped, and the window had a 1/2 inch of dirt on the sill. Supplies to make a cup of coffee were in the room, but there was no coffee maker. We called the front desk to arrange for shuttle to the casino and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. After 30 minutes, we walked out to the front desk to find out how much longer it would be. The staff informed us that they had forgotten to put us on the list for the shuttle... we would have been waiting forever!! I plugged my cellphone in to charge overnight, and awoke to find that it had not charged at all... the outlet had no power supply."
"6953",2,"The lobby was nice, but the room was small and the bathroom was dirty. The room didn't have a small refrigerator which I was shocked to find. So much for my leftovers. The woman when we checked in and out was standoffish. Good things about the hotel: the bed was comfortable and the location was nice. After arriving home I discovered a charge on my card from the hotel. I didn't do anything to incur a charge so I called them to ask about it. The woman on the phone was unbelievably rude! She transferred me to a voicemail where one of my options was to press zero for personal assistance (which is why I called). I was rerouted to the same woman who now seemed incredibly frustrated by me and insisted I leave a voicemail. She transfers me again. I just thought she could have been more polite and accommodating. I did get the issue sorted out, but the attitude of the woman on my initial phone call left a bad taste in my mouth. The location of this hotel is great, but the hotel itself isn't nice enough for the rate and the staff could use a lesson in manners and service."
"6954",5,"The room was comfortable, quiet and clean. The desk staff was super helpful. They even lent me a wall charger for my phone for the night (and offered to let me keep it when I went to return it the next morning). I was given directions to a great neighborhood to run through. Wonderful stay!"
"6955",5,"Booked this hotel as our first stop on our USA roadtrip based on budget so didnt have any expectations on arrival. We drove there from LAX and it was a very easy drive, sat nav got us there in no time. From the second we stepped into the hotel reception area we were greeted by the most welcoming staff ever.... More"
"6956",4,"Mediocre. 2-12 hole in the carpet. Reading lamp missing from desk. Only one bulb in the lamp on the bedside stand, so the room was dark! Overall attention to details is lacking. The front desk staff are polite and helpful. The HVAC unit works well and is relatively quiet."
"6957",5,"Pool, elevator, laundry room It has everything I needed, any questions the staff had beyond taken care of me, such hospitality that makes you feel at home when you're away. Dominique and Nounie are incredible managers and have a wonderful crew. Thank you all."
"6958",5,"easy check in, comfortable stay, friendly hotel staff, would definitely stay again"
"6959",5,"Hotel was a good choice, about 10 mins from the actual beach but me and my family were satisfied. It would have been 100 perfect if there was an indoor pool, but it wasn't. Great hotel though!"
"6960",5,"Bad: Breakfast is exactly the same every day and if you spend there 3 or more days you need a little wider choice. Good: The hotel has an excellent location, and is in walking distance from the beach. The staff is kind, the room is fine and clean, the coffee is good, considering the prices this is a good choice. You can find nice restaurants nearby, shops and bars too."
"6961",4,"We enjoyed our stay. The bed was very comfortable. Staff very pleasant!"
"6962",5,"I must say it was not what I expected. I am more than just pleased with my stay. I was greeted by Tim who was very professional and through with his check-in. He made us feel comfortable in a strange area which at times can be hard to do. I was fearful of crossing the highway with all of the... More"
"6963",1,"The worst experience in my life please never go close to tis hotel ughhhhh nasty rooms smells bad"
"6964",4,"We pulled in for the night on a long trip. Bed was good! Towels a touch rough. The road noise was loud! We have a 'wind machine' on our phone, so we managed, but lots of trucks, lots of traffic. Would ask for the back side if we stayed here again. Very clean and very pleasant front desk."
"6965",5,"The criteria for me to give 5 stars are: pleasant Front Desk, clean rooms, soft bed, quiet and good water pressure with an adequate free breakfast. Everything was a 5 star rating except the breakfast and the decor. This place must have been remodeled or is new.....it was unbelievable!! If I could I would like to give this hotel a... More"
"6966",5,"Cannot say enough good about this place! The addition of the peddle boats and paddle boards really seal the deal that this is the best place on Canada Street! Something for the kids poolside everyday, movies and popcorn and snow cones. This is our second year and I am certain there will be many more to come!"
"6967",4,"Very friendly front desk people. We had a very early flight and left at 4AM. They run shuttle service 24hr/day but you need to let them know if you want to go at a time that they don't run shuttles every 20 minutes. We had a wake-up call and the driver was there at 4 AM. As other reviewers mentioned,... More"
"6968",4,"We stay here frequently when in Gillette. Quality pet-friendly hotel at a budget-friendly rate. We've always been satisfied with our stay. Clean accommodations, friendly staff, good rates."
"6969",3,"The staff was nice, room didn't smell funny like many do. Small repairs were needed. But there is a lot of noise. Could hear everything from above, including walking, and dogs barking....yes..they allow animals. And when people let their door slam it shook the whole room. It happened often. The bed was very hard, and when I turned the fan/heat on it blew the curtain out and away from the window limiting privacy."
"6970",5,"I was skeptical about this motel, but the price could not be beat so my fianc and I gave it a try on a road trip through the UP. We were pleasantly surprised by tbe cleanliness of this motel! We checked in around midnight and the staff was very friendly and helpful with directing us where we could get something... More"
"6971",5,"This hotel is super!!The staff is friendly, and very competent. The room was spacious, and clean, and the bed comfortable. The location is good, and there is a restaurant around the corner. Very quiet."

My husband was sick and they had the hotel dr call and got us meds from pharmacy. They did everything in their power to make his... More"
"6973",4,"It seems like the hotel is still undergoing renovations and that everything is not quite finished yet. However, I think it will be nice once finished. They do have more modern furnishings in the room like plasma tv, and computer hookups."
"6974",5,"Very impressive stay. Friendly and efficient staff. Great complimentary breakfast in a lovely dining area. A surprise complimentary cocktail hour in the evenings....wine, beer, cheese and crackers....even cookies for the sweet tooth. Unexpectedly 5 star weekend for us!"
"6975",3,"Booked this room due to location it was convenient to interstate but it was situated behind a gas station. Room was ok. Spots on sheets but smelled like bleach so you know they had been laundered. They had on 3 1/2 pillows for bed . Hate 1/2 pillows. Breakfast was strictly average and seating area was in lobby. Very weird.... More"
"6976",5,"Just as expected, Hampton deserves a pat on the back. The staff, facility and accommodations were excellent. This location comes highly recommended and knocked it out of the park. My family will be back the next time we're in Knoxville."
"6977",1,"I stayed here for 1 night and discovered bed bugs in the morning. My back was covered in bites and there were multiple bugs under my pillow. I immediately raised the issue to the front desk and they could not be less concerned about the bugs. They informed me that theyve had issues with bed bugs in the past and... More"
"6978",2,"this hotel was dumpy. the layout was strange. I will probably never stay at a La Quinta again."
"6979",4,"Hotel is very affordable, considering its a well kept hotel, in a very nice area, just outside a major city (with hotels 4 times the price near by). Easy access to and from the highways, and just a few blocks from the Metro and MARC stations. Highly recommend and will definitely consider staying here again."
"6980",5,"Traveled there a few weeks back for my 35th birthday and my stay at Aria was nothing short of AMAZING! Will definitely stay there again. From the staff to the food at the buffet and the cafe to the night life. One of the best stays I've had in Vegas!!"
"6981",2,"Not a 3 star more like 2 star. Small room no fridge or micro. Old style room."
"6982",5,"Very satisfied with my stay and very affordable! The breakfast in the morning was great as well. It was a very easy process to check out in the morning. The employees that I walked past in the hallways were very friendly. Overall it was a very pleasant stay!"
"6983",3,"Older motel but in nice shape. Good location close to the dam. Room was a little dark with the older wood paneling. Breakfast was good with plenty of food. Staff was helpful and nice. Parking was a little tight in front. Looked most of the people staying there were there to go fishing."
"6984",4,"Rolled in 11:30 laid out heads down woke up to continental breakfast and rolled out at daybreak. It is under construction but heat they have done so far is beautiful. Very nice updated pool area for an older motel. The staff was super nice"
"6985",2,"Check-in at 3pm but room was not available until after 6pm. Was offered complimentary upgrade by staff to a slightly larger room and later charged the higher rate for this room. Although room was paid in cash, I was advised that a 50 hold is necessary for incidentals. I authorized this hold and was subsequently charged 3x totaling 150. Hotel... More"
"6986",3,"Bad: Needs remodeleing Could hear planes taking offf. We've stayed at airport hotels before that are soundproofed so well you can't hear the planes. Good: Close to airport"
"6987",2,"The hotel looked like it was in good condition, after entering my room, I noticed that everything in the living room and kitchen was a bit slanted which didn't really bother me. The floor was sloped causing everything to be slant, an obvious foundation issue or very poor construction. While I was in the bedroom, I heard voices and thought someone had entered into the suite, turns out it was people talking in the hallway and because of the slope, there was a 2 inch+ gap between the door and the floor. I was only staying at the hotel for 8 hours, so I didn't ask for a room change, but beware of what room you get."
"6988",4,"Booked the hotel during July 4th weekend because it was relatively close to Sea World. Paid double the normal rate because of the holiday weekend as usual. Just needed a place to stay the night and was cheaper than surrounding hotels. Room was clean, staff was friendly at check in. No complaints and would stay again in the future."
"6989",4,"Love the service and the room was very nice. The only compliant I had is it was very noisy. The air/heat unit made a lot of noise, people slamming doors in the hall and the outside street/parking lot noise was bad."
"6990",3,"The hotel was nice. The hallways were nasty though. The floor looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in months. The pool room was freezing. Couldn't take our 18 month swimming for very long. The hot tub stopped working our second day there. Was the same temperature as the pool. Otherwise, very nice, spacious hotel. Friendly staff. Just a couple of things to work on."
"6991",4,"We arrived in Atlanta on a Saturday around 9pm for a one night stay during a cross country trip.

For some reason the note about connecting rooms wasn't in the reservation. The clerk apologized... More"
"6992",5,"The Virginian Suites is a great hotel with an extremely friendly and helpful staff."
"6993",3,"The rooms were clean, but the hotel was more functional than inviting. The pool was small and always occupied(if more then 7 people in was crowded, it seemed) so we did not use it. Our family lived close by so it was convenient but is in middle of nowhere(although the area is being built up) if the feel was less functional and more inviting then I would have given 5's the breakfast was worth the extra money I paid for the rooms(as compared to another hotel without it)."
"6994",3,"For a weekend getaway this was a bit of a let down. I would recommend for a business traveler which it seemed geared toward, but for a fun couples weekend in the gas lamp it didn't provide any of the boutiquey extras I've come to expect. The room was small and very generic. The bathroom in particular, the tub was... More"
"6995",4,"We stayed for the weekend and made trips back and forth to the beach. It's about a 20 minute drive to the beach but we didn't run into any traffic. The continental breakfast was great! The hotel staff was great! Definitely would stay again!"
"6996",5,"Nice place to stay! I would recommend to anyone needing overnight stay. The rooms are clean and spacious. The beds are amazing! The staff here is very friendly and helpful! Very reasonably priced and great locations."
"6997",3,"Heater was blowing cool air in morning. Some things in the room seemed shoddy or unfinished like sprinkler, wall around the light switch, and when you first enter one of the lightswitches that I believe was meant to turn on the lamps did nothing. Also we were only there one nite but in that time our room keys both got deactivated. We were very pleased with complimentary breakfast offerings except that there was cream cheese but no bagels and the type of milks were not labeled."
"6998",5,"The rooms were clean, neat, and its surpisingly quiet.( Because its located just near the Interstate)..Not a good selection of Breakfast though....."
"6999",1,"I found bedbug on my arm and my bed!!! Immediately, I took shower and packed my stuffs. It was around 1:00:am. I drove my car to my client's parking lot and slept inside of my car until next morning."
"7000",4,"I was in town on business at the convention center, which is walking distance. This is a good place to stay, even for those visiting the Disney parks nearby. This is motel type place but renovated to modern standards with good fixtures. 2 Queen bedrooms are very spacious and clean. No breakfast here but it is close to many restaurants."
"7001",3,"Everything was good except for the occasional loud neighbors. The air conditioner had a hard time keeping the room at a constant temperature. The bed was comfy for a non memory foam bed, the shower pressure was good.Thank you for your helpful feedback. We appreciate your business."
"7002",5,"From the moment we arrived to the second we left the hotel was amazing. Excellent affordability without skimping on quality. The staff team we so helpful and friendly. The hotel is situated in a central location with good access to Route 66 and The Grand Canyon We loved it"
"7003",5,"Close to shopping and restaurants. Very friendly staff"
"7004",5,"The 2 room suite was great and the overall service was outstanding. The price of the suite was very reasonable. The provided Breakfast was great and the front desk personnel were outstanding. We could not have asked for better service. We will stay there on all of our trips to Phoenix."
"7005",4,"Bad: HODO lounge service was poor."
"7006",1,"Stayed in the hotel to try it out after very fond memories of staying in the Staybridge Suites in Ballantyne, NC (I did a company relo and my family lived in this hotel for 6 months - just a great place). I travel to Virginia for business quite frequently and wanted to try out a new hotel. I typically stay... More"
"7007",1,"When I first pulled in the parking lot I seen furniture sitting outside of every room on the first floor, when I asked the front desk clerk about it he said they were remodeling. We found hair in the sheets so we asked the clerk for new sheets and he couldn't locate any. The next morning we went to front desk and the clerk told us tocall corporate. Later that night is when we discovered that we were actually being bitten by bed bugs not only were we bit we saw them with our own eyes I lifted the pillow from under my husband and seen one tiny bug,then I started to examine my daughters bed and I spotted a huge one."
"7008",4,"Someone probably a man and left the toilet seat up and hadn't flushed the toilet. Not a good look and not a comforting thought when you check into a room. My biggest pet peeve is hypoallergenic rooms should be part of a hotels standard capacity. Why should a consumer have to advise the front desk to have someone from housekeeping come in and change out pillows and maybe a comforter. Be proactive not reactive, it makes more the hotel more appealing to consumers and brand loyal"
"7009",4,"Hotel stay was great! Good service and customer care as always! The live concert by river was enjoyable. Happy hour on patio at Colorado Belle was awesome. I really enjoy the 5 blackjack two deck tables."
"7010",4,"Slowest wifi and not a whole lot of TV channels"
"7011",5,"We stayed for 3 nights and had a room with a great view of the strip on the 25th floor. Rooms are lovely with a tablet to control all functions. Everything is pricey here but that's to be expected from the strip!"
"7012",1,"not good"
"7013",4,"Staff very friendly. For most part wall and TV muffled tantrum in next room, but not quite as well as I'd like. Treadmill was out of service when I went in, but other equipment was available. Staff responded well to reported issue. Road construction may have caused my neighborhood rating to be lower than it should."
"7014",4,"The location of this hotel is great. It's in a lovely spot on St. Charles and it's very easy to get around with the streetcar stop right outside. It's an older hotel and so you do find some of the issues you would expect...doors that stick, very thin walls, etc. It is very clean, even though you will find some... More"
"7015",5,"We finished business outside Philly early and took a chance on a room at Home2. Friendly front desk had 3 of us checked in within minutes. Large, clean, well-appointed suite with comfy bed and enormous bathroom awaited us. Perfect location to walk to eat, shop, catch a train for other points within Philly or direct to airport. My flight was delayed and they provided me with a late check-out no problem. Plan to return with my family! Definite yes for anyone staying in Center City."
"7016",1,"What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!"
"7017",4,"Bad: room was not ready til 530 kept being told to come back in 15 to 20 minutes more or less wasted the afternoon then when we got in the toilet backed up and it took 3 or 4 calls to the front desk to get it fixed another be there in 15 to 20 minutes about 3 hours. Good: location and patio area were great"
"7018",5,"everything was great - location, hotel lobby,  pool, The  only negative point was the awful coffee served at breakfast. Breakfast food in and off itself was fine. Loved being able to sit on the patio"
"7019",5,"Rooms clean, digital check-in upon arrival was less than 60 seconds. Worth the time saving and convenience. Room was clean ad set up conveniently for comfort. This was my second experience with digital check-in and found it convenient and easy"
"7020",4,"I had a great stay. It was easy access to the interstate, as well as easy access into downtown DC. I must say I was disappointed with having to pay for parking. Overall breakfast was good, but on two different days I had to contact the concierge about sour dairy products. The problem was fixed, but it made me leary. Well rested nights. This is good deal."
"7021",5,"This hotel almost makes me feel like I'm a king. When I address any issues, they get it fix right away. The location of this hotel is perfect. Concierge is very helpful. You can't go wrong with this hotel for sureDear Matthew S, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"7022",2,"We arrived early we were told we could check in at 11:30. We went did some running around came back. We were then told we couldnt check in until 1:30. Once we finally checked in we were told we had to put down a 100 deposit. That was not said when we booked the room. We were given a room with no view (houses) when we specifically asked for one with a city view so we had to go back downstairs get a new room. There was no refridgerator, no coffee pot, no microwave. We wont be back there. We could have stayed somewhere else that was on the strip for the same price and gotten more ammenities."
"7023",4,"Nice hotel and very nice staff. Big problem with the hotel internet WIFI which attacked our computer with a virus that our virus protection was able to detect and remove...but it made the WIFI unsafe and therefore unusable for our entire three-night stay."
"7024",5,"Bad: Not enough supplies. Good: Everything"
"7025",3,"Okay value for money. No bugs, odors, or loud noises. The breakfast was considerably above average. The condition of the room needed upgrading: wall paper, bathroom door. Some lights (2) not working properly. We slept well."
"7026",2,"Bad: Bed bugs. Room too small. Too expensive When I was going to sleep, I found some bed bugs in my bed. It's terrible! I went to lobby to find someone help me. The receptionist helped me change a room. This room is even smaller than the previous one. I can't sleep all the night because it's too noisy, and I am still afraid of the bugs. The next day, I told the receptionist I would like to check out, even I booked for 3 night. She agreed, but didn't give me any compensation. I paid 300+ for a room which had bugs and was noisy, small. Good: The attitude of staff."
"7027",5,"We had an amazing experience. The hotel was very close to everything and every single employee had excellent customer service. Will definitely go back."
"7028",5,"This place is amazing. Beautiful rooms. Clean and spacious. Front desk was very friendly. Will def try to come back in August for my birthday! Beautiful lobby and an outdoor seating area with a fire pit and a grill. Minutes from PNC field. Heading there later to watch a game. The pool area and fitness room and hot tub area... More"
"7029",4,"What a fantastic position! We were so lucky and had an upgrade to a beautiful ocean view room. The bed was so comfortable and with very quiet air conditioning we had a brilliant nights sleep. Sad that breakfast wasn't included in the price so that's the reason for 4 stars but we found a fantastic breakfast at Joan's on third... More"
"7030",5,"Always a great stay at the ARIA, love the rooms and dining options. Tables get a little high on weekends but that happens. Great location and shopping nearby (high end,shopping) Highly recommend Todd English PUB for drinking and Serrano for eating"
"7031",4,"My wife and I have stayed in several Motel 6s this year and this one is mostly average with the exception that it has a microwave and refrigerator which is a big plus. This was our first trip to Redding and this location was recommended by a friend. We stopped by the South location by mistake and if I had... More"
"7032",2,"Place is old, smoky, and run down. The location is awkward to get to."
"7033",4,"We needed a nice, reasonably priced, comfortable, fun place to stay while visiting schools with our son - this was perfect! We loved the Adirondack decor, the spacious room, good breakfast and friendly staff. Thanks."
"7034",4,"I chose this hotel because the room had a kitchen, it was inexpensive, and it was close to the Hampton Convention Center (about 1/3 mile). The room was comfortable and clean, although the armchair, carpet, and bedspread needed to be spot-cleaned. There was a problem with my air conditioning unit which was fixed relatively quickly, even though it was a weekend. The staff was friendly."
"7035",5,"Well maintained facilities, courteous staff, as you expect in the Hilton chain. close proximity to BWI airport great weekend rate, at least that weekend."
"7036",2,"Good: Staff was rude to me and didn't recognize my platinum status"
"7037",5,"This motel is reasonably priced, has a great location, beautiful pavilion complete with grills/smokers and picnic tables and easy access to the beach. The staff is friendly and the rooms are perfectly nice for an inexpensive getaway. Will definitely stay here again. Great job, Sea Aire. Keep it up!"
"7038",5,"We stayed a night we were on a family trip the stay was so peaceful. The room was beautiful comfy bed and great channels. I would stay again when visiting that area. Also the staff was really friendly and professional."
"7039",5,"Really enjoyed our stay at this property! The standard rooms are fairly decent sized and so are he bathrooms. The lounge area is spectacular and vey lively at night. The biggest advantage of this hotel is the location. It's close to the 3rd street promenade and the pier the beach at Santa Monica.. Will visit again!!"
"7040",3,"I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the room, which was very dated. The staff was super friendly, and I appreciated that. The breakfast area was crowded, and being on of the first rooms in the hotel, it seemed everybody wanted to walk by having a conversation at full volume while I was trying to sleep."
"7041",2,"When there is a Colts game, parking commitments to guests are abandoned in favor of game day parking. The debacle caused us to miss a planned event. Had to check out early because the valets could not promise to bring my car on time, even though I gave them an hour's notice. 25 daily parking fee should ensure better service."
"7042",5,"We stayed at the hotel while visiting the USF campus. The double queen executive suite was very spacious and clean. All of the rooms face inward to the pool/ courtyard area, which was very nice. The hotel restaurant, Burger Theory, had some of the best burgers we have eaten in a long time, with very pleasant staff. The hotel offered... More"
"7043",4,"On my way out east, the perfect distance to travel for the day. Brought my bicycle into the room overnight after I drove over to the Rock River and road the trail there for a few miles. Fast/easy breakfast items coffee in the morning."
"7044",4,"We really enjoyed our week! The beach does have erosion but still so beautiful. Our unit was in building 6. We loved the pool and staff was super friendly. We used the complimentary bikes one day and liked them a lot. Loads of food options. Only drawback was that they've implemented some sort of room temperature control so you can't... More"
"7045",4,"My boyfriend and I stayed here a weekend in July for our anniversary. Wanted to visit Baltimore but not pay the prices for the Inner Harbor hotels. This hotel was perfect. It was extremely affordable for a 2 night weekend stay and surpassed our expectations. It was only a 15 minute drive to Inner Harbor. The staff was very friendly and the room was great. Room was spacious, updated and SO clean. Felt like a mini apartment. Also one of the few hotels we found that had an outside pool. I would definitely recommend this hotel!"
"7046",5,"The Residence Inn in Naples was a great place to stay in Naples. They upgraded us to a two bedroom suite after the first night which was very nice (I'm a Platinum member). Thanks Lauren! Close to downtown, beaches and plenty of restaurants. The pool area is very nice and all of the staff was great. Highly recommended for families."
"7047",5,"Hotel staff has been very accommodating and making my stay a wonderful one. They have went out of their way to ensure the smallest details are taken care of, just to make my stay more comfortable. The Paradise restaurant and lounge is second to none here in Moses Lake. Everyone is so friendly and courteous, especially Lisbeth. I recommend going... More"
"7048",5,"Used for last night before flight. Hotel was immaculate. Staff was friendly and efficient. Breakfast was standard but what we expected. Would definitely choose again. Were also helpful when cancelling earlier arrival reservation due to flight cancellation. Will review airline in separate review."
"7049",5,"This is a great hotel walking distance to Disneyland friendly staff clean rooms great price will stay again"
"7050",4,"As a frequent guest at the Aria, our most recent trip was almost as expected. The property in general is outstanding for it's facilities and its location on the strip. The modern decor and high end furnishings definitely make the Aria stand out from other resorts . However, we have began to notice a small degradation of the quality of... More"
"7051",5,"Bad: A little pricey. Good: Staff members were very nice. The food at the hotel's restaurant was extremely delicious. Walking distance to the beach and many other restaurants on Ocean Drive. The rooms were clean and spacious."
"7052",4,"Ok, their computers were down when I checked in. The wait to check in was too long AND the person behind the desk allowed another guest to deliberately cut in front of me and when questioned I was given an explanation of 'I don't know'. Then when I checked in, I was given the wrong room because someone was already in it. When I went back to lobby, there was another long wait because apparently other guests were given the wrong room also. Also, the card I checked in with for incidentals was charged for the stay, even though, I've already paid through hotels.com. I am aware that circumstances arise that are sometimes out of their control and I believe the the situation was handled to the best of their ability. I was given free items from the lobby fridge for the rude guests that cut in front of me AND my room was upgraded for free because I was initially given the wrong room. Lastly, I was completely reimbursed for them charging twice on my card. The situations were handled efficiently and the staff was accommodating to my concerns, questions and needs."
"7053",1,"Overall miserable experience. Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location. Manager had a very confrontational attitude and certainly does not treat her guest like I am accustom at other higher end Hilton properties. She certainly makes it clear your word isn't good enough unless she can see the messed up room details for herself.... More"
"7054",2,"Hole in shower, broken toilet seat. Facility is worn and needs to be updated."
"7055",3,"Bad: Staff were not particularly knowledgeable about the charges applied to the bill. Desk staff indifferent to customers."
"7056",5,"Stayed here 3 nights for work. It's a great area, lots of good restaurants nearby and easy uber / commuting distance to if you're sight seeing. Room I had was slightly upgraded and was lovely. Very big, bathroom was huge and had a double shower, one was like a fire hose - great to wake up to! Food was great,... More"
"7057",5,"me and my girlfriend was just looking for a random hotel to stay in since she live in north carolina i stay in virginia came across this for a gud price booked it enjoyed our little weekend together loved the kitchen and the water n the shower wasnt cold had no problem that wasnt fixable it was a nice comfortable stay"
"7058",4,"Looking out over the ocean from your balcony window trumps (almost) any negatives. The rooms are showing their age but are maintained as well as can be expected. If you walk outside the hotel, at night, expect to meet some fairly odd/unusual people. ...Oh and there's a USN base nearby and F-18's scream overhead every 5 mins. lol"
"7059",5,"The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan"
"7060",4,"Nice stay, clean rooms. Right off the 15 fwy. The staff gave us the 2 rooms we requested next to each other. They were comfortable. The continental breakfast was sufficient. Walking distance to Peggy Sues diner. (Not affiliated with the one off the I-15 near Barstow)."
"7061",4,"Bad: The bathtub didn't drain properly. Good: Complementary breakfast, large size room."
"7062",5,"I have spent the last two birthdays at this hotel. It is the BOMB! Everything you want in a 5 star resort. I have so much fun. I visit the cafe for breakfast. I love the Vegas style bakery, with so many choices. The crepes are heavenly! The pool is beautiful and relaxing. They even have a suite-member only pool.... More"
"7063",5,"Bad: Breakfast pretty modest but I could leave with that!. Good: Excellent location next to attractions, commercial area, everything. Friendly and helpful staff. The room was not big but well equipped. Good price for Boston which is an expensive city."
"7064",5,"Far from Boston if you do not have a car Front desk night time super. I will like to give 10 Starst Pero so far for me This time I didn't have a car. I paid. Cab a lot. Not shuttle not even to Main st. S No shuttle I did asked on the time Of my check in. If you don't have a car is far from Boston. But I recommend this hotel if you have a car , is nice and clean , love it."
"7065",5,"Took family for quick getaway. Got great last minute deal on this property. Kids really enjoyed the grounds and clubhouse was nice touch. Unit was very clean overall we really enjoyed ourselves. We would certainly recommend to anyone interested. Thanks again!"
"7066",2,"While the staff was nice, the keys for the door did not work (old eighties style with many holes. The place smelled like cigerette smoke and was very dirty. The surrounding neighborhood was scary and the parking lot entrance was hard to find."
"7067",4,"I stayed here mid May for a large planned Birthday Party. I arrived at 2:00 pm for a room which I had pre-paid for and they were out of rooms so they can me an upgrade to a 10th Floor Penthouse suite at no extra cost, it was amazing and very large.I had come a few years later for a weekend function but stayed next door at the Marriott. Suncoast is almost as nice but far cheaper.Sunday Brunch was OK but a good deal for 19.00 ( you get a discount at all restaurants if you get their free membership card). I didn't try other restaurants. They are building a lot of Shops and restaurants across the street.I like the area as well, quiet and close to Red Rock Canyon."
"7068",4,"I 'crashed' here after an event, so I had done no research like I would have for a getaway. The location was perfect, the room small but stylish, the bathroom classic and efficient. Our bed wasn't as soft as I needed, but I got a decent night's sleep. After a very late night, we woke to a view of the Lincoln Park Zoo and Lake Michigan. We walked the neighborhood, enjoying the people, sights, scents, and vibe of Lincoln Park. I had zero expectations when I checked in, and definitely found myself wishing we were staying a few more days. The decor was classic and a bit whimsical. I loved it!"
"7069",3,"The price was that of a hotel but it was really more like a motel. The hotel was clean and quite. But the cost was the highest I've ever paid at a BW. I did not go to the pool so I'm not sure the quality of the pool. Pillows at a BW could always be better than they are."
"7070",5,"We planned a last minute 4th of July trip and was lucky enough to snatch up a cancellation at the Crooked Hook Resort. Chuck and Sharon were extremely helpful. They answered questions over the phone, through email, and assisted us practically all hours of the day while we were there. I could have easily spent half of my vacation hanging... More"
"7071",5,"We liked the garden feeling of the one story rooms in the back near the pool. Very lovely and quiet. Nice big trees around. Also, there was a lot of counter space in the bathroom which was handy. We thought of staying somewhere that cost less, read reviews and decided to go ahead and stay here instead. Good idea. You...

"7072",5,"Outstanding hotel. Stayed in a huge suite at a good price. Hotel and room were very clean. Room was quiet, no noise from the hall or other rooms. Excellent service: valet, bellman, room service, front desk. Front desk had two cribs in our room before our arrival. At most hotels, we have to call two or three times after arrival to get cribs delivered, no matter how often we have requested them ahead of time. Only issue: pool was not heated as much as needed."
"7073",5,"Pricey, but that may have had more to do with the Spilleto festival that was going on while we were there. Excellent service and great location... Would definitely stay again if I return."
"7074",5,"Found The Press Hotel when searching Trip Advisor and we were thankful. What a nice surprise finding this architectural gem. We were looking for a property centrally located with amenities. Lucky us, The Press was the solution. The one night weekend rate was way under the rack rate - considerably. The service was top notch from the valet, bellman, and... More"
"7075",5,"Beautiful casino and restaurant and shopping district. Vegas always seems to offer a 5 star experience for much less than other cities. I love this hotel and will be back many times in the future. The staff is friendly, the food is t too pricy and the location is perfect."
"7076",4,"We arrived in Saulsalito around 8pm on a Sat. night with no reservations, as is our habit when traveling on the motorcycle with certain exceptions. There are not a lot of hotels in Sausalito, which surprised me. I lived in the East Bay before, and never thought much about it assumed there were the usual hotels galore found in... More"
"7077",5,"From the moment we arrived, we felt pampered and attended to. The conveniences of the property and Marche made our stay very comfortable. The linens were excellent, and I loved the size of the bathroom and its layout."
"7078",1,"We came here for our anniversary and booked a spa suite, it took the water 15 minutes to get warm and once it was warm 10 minutes later you were blasted with cold water. We called down to the front desk to ask for more pillows because they fell flat as soon as your head hit them the employee at... More"
"7079",3,"Wasn't too thrilled that I had to hike up three flights of stairs to get to my room since none of the elevator were working, but then I found out from some other guests that were sitting out in the first floor hallway that the downstairs had horrible internet service, so being on an upper floor turned out to have its advantages. No complaints regarding the room, amenities, or free breakfast."
"7080",5,"The hotel is well located. The room was great. Staff very helpful and polite. Breakfast was not the best."
"7081",2,"When we walked into our room we found bugs dead and alive in the room. When we searched further we found more dead bugs. They should do a better job of vacuuming the rooms including behind beds tv and fridge."
"7082",4,"nice people great location. good room. clean and friendly"
"7083",1,"We were traveling to the east coast and needed a one night stay so we called ahead and booked with Baymont because he informed us of the Brand new remodeled room. We got to the room and found new carpet and it ended there. The tv was an antique with a remote that would not operate this old set, the... More"
"7084",5,"This is a newer hotel and very clean. My room 312 was very quiet and clean. No elevator noise or ice machine noise. The layout of the rooms are very user friendly with modern decor. Mattress was very comfortable. Great hotel for the price."
"7085",4,"Bad: Too expensive, thought when I booked that happy hour and breakfast were included. The room was not worth 300.00 a night. Good: Loved the location and view"
"7086",5,"We recently spent three nights at The NOPSI in New Orleans. Nothing but good things to say. Beautiful first impression - absolutely gorgeous lobby! Extremely friendly and helpful staff - from the doormen, the front desk folks, the concierge - everyone! The location was an easy walk to the French Quarter but far enough away from the not so nice part. And the rooms were great - spotless, comfortable and large. Nice bars in the lobby and on the roof and also in the adjacent restaurant (which had a very good breakfast). All in all, A+!Frank, Thank you for visiting NOPSI Hotel. Our service professionals strive to make our guests feel at home from the moment they walk through the doors. We are honored that our service has earned your recommendation and look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"7087",5,"Very clean, very modern Shower curtain should have been changed, it was vile, but within 10 minutes, it was changed and the staff were apologetic. Our room had a view of the freeway which we liked. The man checking me in was LOUD! like everyone in the lobby knew what room I was in, my name and my address because he was just loud, but I only spoke to him the one time so that was good. Complimentary drink coupons at check-in for happy hour at the bar were a nice touch. Very comfy bed an super squishy pillows. Very happy with the visit."
"7088",5,"Great stay overall, the room was supposed to have a balcony but it wasn't open. Will definitely go again if we get the chance though."
"7089",1,"Keep driving! The other family that we were traveling with booked and paid for this room far in advance. We arrived without the other family and was given a room on the second level. When my husband and I exited the elevator with our luggage the entire length of the hall smelled like a skunk had run down it. It... More"
"7090",5,"Great"
"7091",5,"Good: can't wait to stay here again!"
"7092",2,"Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out."
"7093",5,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel! From the staff to the food to the cleanliness of the rooms, this is a wonderful place to stay! It's a convenient location surrounded by several great restaurants and minutes from the mall."
"7094",1,"I should have checked Trip Advisor before booking on Agoda. I selected for location and price for which I was satisfied. BUT this place is a real treat. The plastic wrap over the mattress first caught our eye, then the lack of a blanket, poor quality towels, old AC unit with poor controls, and very minimal service - in 4... More"
"7095",4,"I stayed with my sister in this hotel...Basically, as it was New Years, various other hotels closer to the the Strip were booked. The SunCoast staff were very helpful friendly, even when our flight was delayed and we had to reschedule our shuttle pick-up from the airport---use this! The SunCoast is very far from the airport and it is free so you will save yourself money.The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and spacious. The buffet downstairs was decent. The only downside is, again, its distance from the Strip. The shuttle times are not very convenient, especially if you want to spend a night on the town. The cab fare from the Strip to our hotel costs us around 30. So, keep that in mind.Hope this helps!"
"7096",4,"We chose this hotel because of the location and we weren't disappointed. Right opposite the music museum, science museum and space needle. Happy Hour at the bar offered a good selection of local beers and wines. The rooms weren't huge but comfortable and clean. The breakfast was buffet style and a little bit busy with everybody having to convene in a small corridor area where the buffet is served but lots to choose from. Omelettes can be made to order. Convenient to walk the short mile to Pike Place and also to savour many of the great restaurants in the neighbourhood. One negative comment is that there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel, so you could be waiting quite a while for the elevator to come to your floor if it was first thing in the morning and everybody was heading to breakfast. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to guests.Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this review! We are so pleased to hear that you got to experience the neighborhood attractions. We are totally biased, but we think it's pretty great as well! We feel privileged to have had you as our guest - we hope it won't be the last time. Safe travels to you wherever you go - thanks again!"
"7097",3,"Don't let the hotel pics fool you. The rooms are VERY small outdated. Save your money go across the street or even down the street for a better, not to mention safer stay. Pay the extra 10 or 20 go to Holiday Inn Express. Trust me."
"7098",4,"I go to Seattle very frequently for business, and this hotel was the 5th that I've stayed in this city. The room was good and clean. Wifi was stable. TV reception was not the best, but wasn't bad eiter.The hotel is right by the lake, so a nice pleasant walk outside. It's also close to a few restaurants and a corner store.Overall, I think it was a good hotel."
"7099",5,"Very comfortable facility. Quiet and clean rooms. Comfortable beds, nice coffee and mini fridge in room. Nice pool and hot tub for us to relax.

"7100",4,"Very nice hotel! The employees were all very helpful, the rooms were very comfortable and clean, and everything in the rooms, the pool, and the lobby looked clean and up to date. The rates were really good and the location is the perfect driving distance from all the restaurants and stores. This hotel definitely aided in providing us with a positive Key West experience. The only negative thing that I have to say is about the the breakfast. There was no fruit! The only thing they had fruit wise were oranges. It would have been nice if they had fruits like bananas and apples paired up with those oranges. Other than that everything else was A plus.Dear natalianieves22,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel and providing your feedback. We are Happy that you had a Positive Key West Experience, and enjoyed your stay with us. Also thank you for letting me know about the Fruit. We do usually have Bananas as well as cut fruit on the buffet and I will be looking into it so it doesn't happen again. We hope to see you back in Key West again very soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"
"7101",3,"The rooms are nice. A bit noisy with the train but didn't bother us. Breakfast is not even worth mentioning.

Pool was clean and had a nice view with a breeze. Will definitely be back!! I've stayed in many hotels in New Orleans. This one is my favorite."
"7107",4,"Bad: A lot of the staff had a don't ask me its not my job attitude. At the check in desk personal phone calls had guest waiting 3 to 4 minutes before even responded to.

"7111",3,"Bad: I didn't like the smell in the corridor. Good: The breakfast was like same thing everyday. My toilet was not cleaned for three days in a row."
"7112",2,"Business as usual. Nothing special about this hotel except its location. It needs a major facelift."
"7113",3,"Bad: Pounding noise at 3:00a,m, machinery of some type. Several in our party had turn down service and cookies-we did not. Good: Rooms were very clean. Check-in expedient."
"7114",5,"Upgraded to a beautiful suite, wonderful staff, and the best breakfast I've had in years!"
"7115",4,"This is a nice little hotel with a great view overlooking a small marina. Nice rooms and inexpensive. Free parking. No reception staff after 7PM but they will leave you a key to your room.

"7124",5,"Upon arrival at this Best Western property, all staff members did 100 effort to make our stay comfortable. Great tips on local dining spots that turned to some of the best food we had on this trip. Great access from Interstate gets you on and off the road quick. Also a great breakfast to start your day."
"7125",2,"Bad: 1st - PARKING LOT **BAD,BAD,BAD** This is 2017, nobody need driver to parking car, unless you're 85 yrs old (should not even drive). But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER. Good: Location, access to shopping, and cleanning"
"7126",4,"The hotel was beautiful and although it has only been there 8 months I was very pleased with my stay. I felt the hotel was understaffed the weekend I was there which caused check in to be delayed and my room was not ready when I arrived."

The view from the balcony was of a traffic light....Location is not bad, but not next door to vineyards...Worthy of no more than 75-90.Thank you for your review. We are always trying to lead in the best value in the Napa Valley. During the Harvest Season the demand is very high and we are inline with our competition and our average rate is one of the lowest in the valley.

"7133",2,"We showed up early and expected to wait. We had driven 500 mi. so a couple of hours wait for our room, reserved a week prior, was no problem.

"7135",5,"We stayed at this hotel the last week in December the weather was extremely cold, arrived 1 week after the snow storm but the hotel service was very warm. The shuttle service was excellent the would drop pick you up from any area inb their vicinity. Also need to mention that guest from another hotel was waiting in the cold at the mall and the shuttle driver offered to drop them to their hotel which was excellent service. The front desk staff are very helpful. Only downfall, the double room beds are little bigger than twin beds."

Our grandson has extreme food restrictions due to food alergies so we were not sure how this trip would go. It was his first trip away from home. TWe explained to the chef and server that he needed special food preparation and care. They went far and above to make sure his needs were met and to follow up that he was taken care of. Thanks to these good folks we feel more comfortable about travelling with him. The Embassy staff made this a great summer for our grandson."

"7139",4,"My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for one night while we were vacationing in Napa Valley with another couple. The hotel is located in a commercial area, so it lacks the ambiance of a hotel that is located in the hear of wine country. And it is a bit of a longer drive to get to the main roads where the wineries are located.That being said, the lobby of the hotel is very nicely appointed and they do have a good offering of bottles of wine for sale. The staff at the front desk were very nice and were helpful with recommendations and directions. Our room was very comfortable. There was plenty of space and the beds were firm and friendly. The bathroom was clean and included the expected amenities. It was also a very good value, as similar hotels in the area were significantly more expensive. If you're looking for a comfortable place to stay close to Napa Valley and you're not looking for a romantic experience, this hotel would be an excellent choice.Dear ltt18,Thanks for taking the time to write your review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback. As our location is less than 2 miles to downtown we are very close to several wineries in surrounding areas like the Carneros area as well as conveniently near the entrance to highway 29 to reach the other wineries up the valley. It's great to hear that the staff was nice and provided you with recommendations as well as directions to your destinations. At Hampton we provide a great value with complementary breakfast, parking and internet just to name a few. Thank you again for staying with us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa. Best Regards, Serina Najar."
"7140",3,"They tried to put us right next door to a bank of rooms they were remodeling - mattresses and carpet rolls in the hallway, men working until very late, etc. We were there for just one night for new years eve to be close to wineries. Good location for that but a little pricey just because of the day. Nothing special but adequate for what we needed."
"7141",5,"Good: Loved the shower!! The balcony was a great to hear Chicago sounds at night. We will for sure be back."
"7142",5,"Staff was very friendly. Answered all of our question and were helpful. Gave recommendations of places to eat and shop! Breakfast was on point. Food never ran out. Rooms were clean.

"7143",3,"We were satisfied with our accommodations but were surprised by a 9 parking fee. We were not aware of the fee before hand and this should be disclosed when booking the hotel."
"7144",3,"Bad: The wifi wasn't working for 3 days. ."
"7145",2,"When I looked at the pictures , I thought that I have an excellent deal at hand but it turned out to be a total let down ...This hotel is not even worth comparing to a MOTEL6 or SUPER8 . It is run down and shabby . Will not stay here ever."
"7146",5,"What a great experience at this property. The valet was superb, the check-in process was so simple, and the room was pristine. Food was great and all of the amenities on the property are ample to stay and enjoy a nice getaway or close enough to everything to go explore."

"7154",1,"My brother was in the hospital, and I needed to be there for him. Did not want anything problems until this hotel was not very satisfying. The first night, the hotel only took the trash out in my room. So I made a comment to the front desk, is this unusually just to take the trash out. So she made a note to the cleaning dept. The next night my room was not cleaned at all, so you can imagine how upset I was. One night not cleaned, but two nights. When I complaint again, the front desk just told me it's not there problem. It's the cleaning employees so this upset me even more. They did give me some clean towels for that night so I can shower. Also, I felt the breakfast area was not kept up with the cleaning. Very messy. I would not recommend to stay here. But I did have a king size bed, and it was very comfortable."

"7159",4,"With a great location close to everything, the Austin Motel is far from a boring Holiday Inn. It's great for first-timers to Austin, because it is infused with lots of local charm. Great bars and live music venues are a short walk away."
"7160",3,"the breakfast at 17 bucks was a bit of disgrace. it is a particular building."

We are glad you enjoyed your stay and will see you on your next visit."
"7167",5,"every was pleasent and helpful. clean room, the door could of used a some oil really noisy"
"7168",2,"Bad: This place wasn't just right for me: Booked a room with partial sea view - got one on the second floor which was blocked by a palm tree, staff was ok but tended to be on the arrogant side. Lots of younger people stayed there so if you are looking for a more boutique type of hotel that deserves the name you may want to look somewhere else. Good: The bed was very comfortable"
"7169",4,"This unassuming hotel is well located for sightseeing, restaurants and views of the Chicago River and the river walk. The rooms are comfortable with basic amenities and free wi-fi but best suited for one person. A guest lounge on the second floor offers a large lobby, TV, computer terminals and an array of snacks, fruit, beverages. The highest praise is reserved for the front desk staff - Ramon and Diego were friendly and competent making restaurant suggestions that were delicious (Benny's Chop House).Dear Jeri G, thank you for taking the time to write a review and especially the kind words you had for Roman, Diego and the staff. There is nothing we love more than being able to share wonderful comments like yours with the staff and we will be sure the team sees it.

We look forward to welcoming you back soon!"

The staff was very accomodating and supported any requests that we made. PArticularly when we needed an extra night and they were oversold. Aric was a gem constantly checking on how we were doing when he saw us on the property and assisting with some printing needs when the lobby printer was tied up and I needed to get some things mailed ASAP. I definately recommend this hotel if you are going to Disney or looking to attend an Angels game.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you so much for your wonderful review.

Not enough power outlets handy to recharge the cell phones of the group in my room. Continental breakfast was so lousy, we ate breakfast elsewhere. Elevator was out of order upon arrival (was fixed during our stay). In dire need of a renovation. If you can book it for the same price as Motel 6, then go for it, otherwise avoid until a renovation occurs."
"7173",5,"Located directly next to the Space Needle and with all kinds of food options nearby, the Maxwell served as an excellent base for discovering Seatlle.

"7209",5,"I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves. Thank you for taking the time to review our property on TripAdvisor, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"
"7210",5,"We have gone scalloping with Capt Russ for the past four summers. It is truly one of our favorite activities. We always get our scallop limit. Russ is so helpful, knowledgeable and relaxed that we all can't wait to see him. We have sent many groups his way and everyone feels the same. Scalloping with native sun tours is a... More"
"7211",5,"Granted the rooms in this hotel are not enormous but the high standard of service and spotlessly clean rooms make up for it. The location was perfect and the huge lounge area filled with computers that actually work was a great access. The front desk staff were charming living up to the reputation of customer service. The other great asset was the fact there was door located between the hotel and the restaurant next door. It rained one night during our stay so we were happy to take advantage of the restaurant which incidentally became our choice of breakfast venue as well.Dear JulieThank you so much for so many kind comments and observations.I am delighted that you had such an enjoyable stay with us and were well looked after. I am glad that you also enjoyed the Elephant Castle restaurant, it offers great value for money, service and very convenient opening hours - especially for the night owls. Come see us again soon.RegardsPAul TiernanHotel Manager"
"7212",4,"For the location and price this place is a diamond in the rough. It was clean, had all the amenites one would like. But do not expect any service from the staff. The hispancis who cleaned up were the most friendly, they did speak each morning. There was a buffet breakfast that was offered (for a price), we were not even told about it. My daughter found it while exploring the hotel. They run two shuttles to the metro station, neither one would detour out of their way to drop us off at Arlington National Cememtary for a funeral. As I said before the property is well keep, clean, nice and for the location and price a deal. But do not expect southern hosptality or anyone to go out of their way to do anything special for you."
"7213",4,"Hotel was worth the price. Some false advertising, like complimentary bottled water and newspaper. Front desk can use a little customer relations training."
"7214",5,"A great classic hotel with old world charm and character and some great service from all the staff I interacted with. I stayed here for a week and this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in for some time. Large plush, quite rooms, attentive service, a good gym and good food in a handy location near Buckhead....

"7215",3,"We attended a conference at the Galt House in January 2016. We arrived on January 5. The entire hotel was over-the-top decorated for Christmas. We departed on January 10. Still Christmas. Gee, I thought Christmas was December 25. Nope, not at the Galt House. ANNOYING TO THE MAX. The rooms are in desperate need of renovation. And sounds travels like... More"
"7216",5,"I cannot say enough good things about the comfort level and cleanliness of this hotel. Great breakfast items, vast majority of goodies. They even have fresh berries for your cereal toppings. Great coffee too. Very comfortable bed and lots of plush pillows. Clean workout room with good machines."
"7217",5,"i have stayed in this hotel many times due to working in okc. Staff is very friendly and rooms are clean. I would recommend anybody that likes to stay in a clean, and reasonable price hotel. Breakfast is good as well."
"7218",5,"I have been staying at this hotel for 25 years when I am in Murray KY What the hotel lacks in amenities the staff more than makes up for it. From the top down, all are so extremely helpful and cooperative. I love THE UNIVERSITY INN BEST WESTERN!"
"7219",4,"The hotel is clean and pretty much up-to-date. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The annoying thing sometimes can be that the heating or a/c can be really noisy. The trick is to heat/cool up your room enough during the day time so that you can shut it completely down during the night."
"7220",5,"it was great"
"7221",4,"Red Roof Inn, is nice and clean... They have reinavated their property. The rooms are nice... Great stay!!!!"
"7222",3,"I chose this Microtel because I had stayed here before about eight years ago and it was very nice. At the time it typified a Microtel - clean, efficient, comfortable, modern. This particular Microtel has gone downhill. The wall above the closet was damaged, the tub was worn, and the plumbing under the sink was disgustingly filthy. There are a number of lodging options within a block the next time I need to stay in this area I will use one of them."
"7223",5,"All of the staff we encountered seemed genuinely interested in making our experience the best possible. They were all very accommodating, starting at the front desk the moment we checked in. There was no pretentiousness whatsoever. How very refreshing."
"7224",2,"Parking lot not cleared of snow. Paths and road very slippery with no salt applied. Front desk not helpful. No hot water for shower in morning. Other guests had same issue. Front desk said there is no hot water problem and then told it is an old boiler which has issues."
"7225",5,"If Justin Bieber and then-Bruce Jenner stays here, you know it has to be good. This Boutique hotel near downtown, may be small, but it offers friendly attentive service, wonderful facilities, delectable food (from a nearby in my view: 5 rated restaurant) and a good location."
"7226",4,"This hotel serves its purpose. We stayed here when visiting Phoenix for spring training. Most hotels were booked and very expensive. This was a bit out of the way but worth the savings. Room was updated and clean. Fabian at the front desk was great!"
"7227",4,"Hotel ist ca. 10-12 min zu Fuss von der U-Bahn nach Washington D.C. entfernt. Es gibt in Silver Spring verschiedene Restaurants und Shopping Moeglichkeiten. Klassisches Business Hotel, dass eine gute Alternative zu den Stadthotels direkt in Washington D.C. darstellt. Preis-Leistungs-Verhaeltnis passt."
"7228",5,"We can't remember how many times we have stayed at Brewster By The Sea over the years. Each time it is a relaxing and memorable experience.

"7229",2,"When we first arrived inside the room a strong smell of mildew hit me. I decided to ignore it thinking it could be worse, and it was. Grasshoppers and other bugs were EVERYWHERE. The best part was the chirping throughout the night, from inside the room. The bathroom was not cleaned thoroughly and I was glad to get out of... More"
"7230",3,"The beds were hard. Too few outlets. Overall a good place to stay."
"7231",5,"What a killer hotel! I got in really early and there was no room available when I arrived, but the front desk took quick care in making sure I had somewhere to change and get ready for work in time! Such great service! Rooms were very clean and well maintained with great views of the city! I will be back, thanks!Hi Michael, Thanks for the great review!! Glad we were able to help get you to work on time.

I had a little trouble finding it at first since I drove to where I thought the address directed but saw a sign that said the office is actually in a building entitled Grand Coulee Motel. I found out later that two hotels had... More"
"7233",4,"Bad: Breakfast is very poor. Good: Room was very comfortable. Ideally positionned."
"7234",3,"Bad: 1. Elevator was broken room was on 3rd floor--moved after a time to another wing with working elevator. 2. Pool under repair--sent to another hotel--no available chairs at the pool - so no pool on a 95 day. Wasted 3 hours of the day. 3. Told there was a 30 minute wait to get a car from valet--called at 7:20 AM--valet was not told to get the car until 7:53 AM. Almost missed plane. Good: management staff was very good when they were there"
"7235",3,"We made a reservation for a King room. Upon checkin, we were given a key to a 9th floor room. To our surprise, when we opened the door, it was a room with two beds. Back to the lobby we went to inform the staff and be moved to another room. The next room we were given was on the 5th floor. Upon entering, the tv was on, one of the TWO (again) beds was unmade. Carried all of our luggage back down to the front desk AGAIN to be moved. We were then upgraded to a suite in the seventh floor which satisfied me and made me much less angry. The room was very clean and a great size. When we went to the simon area at night to eat, we stood at the deal for ten minutes while the staff only looked at us. I finally walked over to someone and asked about eating and they informed me they were closing in 3 minutes. Would have been nice if one of the waitresses came over to inform us they were closing instead of just looking at us stand there waiting to be seated."
"7236",5,"We stayed over night so we could catch an early flight the next morning. The motel provided transportation to the airport. They were so nice about it! They gave us a free sample beer the night before, and free coffee the next morning. We would have been given breakfast, too, but we had to leave too early."
"7237",5,"Bad: We hated the window were fake. Good: I liked the location the most"
"7238",5,"The two days I spent at your Best Western Inn near the Rochester airport, was great before and after my sons graduation ceremony from RIT college. The breakfast every morning was delicious and definitely worth getting up early for. I really enjoyed my stay at this location."
"7239",5,"Park and Fly service available"
"7240",5,"Stayed here 2 nights. Rooms were large and spotless. Full breakbast included - even made-to-order omelettes and eggs. We didn't use the pool but there were lots of families there who did. Strong smell of chlorine in the lobby though the first night."
"7241",3,"Room was across street from ocean. It's confusing so be careful when you book. I booked non ocean view but didn't think that meant I had to cross street. I think there are some non ocean view rooms on the side of ocean but not sure. It wasn't a big deal though as it was a small walk."
"7242",5,"Stayed at the Oxford a couple times now and it has always delivered. Welcoming staff that always greets you with a smile and asks how they can help. This past weekend our suite was amazing and had the perks of a large balcony and steam room shower with two shower heads, which was perfect after a long day of skiing.... More"
"7243",5,"Great location in Vail. Located right along the river. Nice heated pool and hot tub. Great customer service."
"7244",5,"The Troubadour was an awesome hotel for us! I absolutely LOVED the decor. The bed side tables couldnt be beat! The roof top bar was an incredible view and it was even more special because thats where my boyfriend proposed! I couldnt ask for a better view. Its a nice central location and the food market next door was awesome! The only thing I wish was better was the valet service. They werent very timely and one of them gave us serious attitude. Other than that it was incredible and I would 100 go back!! Thank you so much for taking the time to share this lovely review of your stay with us at The Troubadour. It was truly our pleasure to be a part of this special moment and congratulations on your engagement. We appreciate having you stay with us and look forward to having you back as our guest anytime your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,"
"7245",2,"The side door was broken and stuck open-not safe by my standards. There was plastic food storage under my bed skirt. My room was comfortable and a great breakfast started at 4am which helps for early flights."
"7246",5,"I was in Las Vegas on a quick business trip recently and really didn't have any idea where to stay. Aria looked new and fresh and the package deal with airfare was pretty compelling. The room was large with a stunning view and huge windows. The room was clean enough to eat off the floor (although I chose not to).... More"

"7248",1,"The website pictures of the hotel are very deceitful and does not match the actual product when one stays in the room. The pictures are misleading. The staff was rude and indifferent. The room we stayed in was smelly, dirty and poorly cleaned. The buffet breakfast was terrible and was done on a very low budget, they put out some... More"
"7249",3,"Given the location of the hotel, it wasn't a bad stay. I know the name on the outside has changed a few times but the interior hasn't changed much at all.. The over night desk clerk mumbles when he speaks making my late night check-in that much more agonising. The maintenance housekeeping crew were overly polite and courteous, loved it. The front desk clerk and manager both over night and day shifts need to take a page from their fellow employees book on manners."
"7250",5,"The chilis down the road is a little wait but the food and service is amazing. Nightlife is a drive but it's nice to park your car at one and walk I drive. The beds are a little hard but still got a good nights sleep."
"7251",3,"Although the employees were very nice and friendly, and the hotel was clean, I cannot give it more stars because the rooms were tiny and the beds were the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on. Blankets were also thin. Continental breakfast was adequate."
"7252",4,"My friend and I stayed at the Pearl 4 nights, it was a return visit. January 27th-31st. The rooms are large, clean and have internet access.The location is excellent walking distance to the beach,restaurants and shopping and the best part is the price very resonable."
"7253",3,"This was the first time we stayed at this motel. We usually stay at chain hotels with a free breakfast, but none was available. so we decided to give this a try. It is nothing fancy, but has all you need. (As long as you don't need a hair dryer or shampoo, which we didn't.) The room was small, but... More"
"7254",5,"Came to stay on way home from Baltimore- testing for husband- and had to meet in moyock NC. So decided rather then drive to OBX and turn around and drive back we stayed in Newport News. The staff was very nice- the room quiet and comfortable- and the area good for eats and shopping."
"7255",4,"Bad: I expected to have a much larger room that looks more like a suite."
"7256",4,"I stay in at least one Hampton inn per week. Usually they are all the same which is what you would expect and average. This Hampton does a few things different and better! Mini sandwiches and snacks were available at check in gratis nice touch for sure. At breakfast it wasn't the same scrambled eggs they heat up from a... More"
"7257",3,"We do Portland weekends several times a year and we've had great experiences in all the hotels that we've stayed in. A friend recommended the Benson, so we decided to give it a try. Gorgeous lobby, very friendly and efficient front desk staff, good-sized room (Junior King Suite), and a comfortable bed. The room was very beige, which isn't a... More"
"7258",3,"Bad: The television was so small that it could barely be seen from the bed. The fitness room was way below par, only two working machines. And, the HVAC in the room was balky, loud, clunky and less than adequate. Good: Location for me was excellent. Breakfast was a real value and the size of the room was really large."
"7259",4,"Good hotel for a one night stay"
"7260",1,"I am on a business trip. The service is like dial up. I already changed rooms to get a signal. I am using my Iphone to connect. Talked to someone from their ISP named Kevin. Completely worthless. Never called me back and didn't fix a thing,"
"7261",4,"Close to metro, 15-20 min walk was pleasant."
"7262",5,"There are only 3 hotels in Mesquite that take dogs, I have stayed at one of the others. There is no comparison, the Best Western had super modern rooms, a area close to the hotel for the dogs to run in a field, QUIET rooms, I didn't hear anything from outside while staying there. its within walking distance to a... More"
"7263",5,"Good: We liked that breakfast was served until 10am. Traveling with young adults and children, it makes for a hectic morning when we have to get to breakfast by 9am. It was a nice, short walk to the Maryland Science Museum and National Aquarium. We were prepared for below average temperatures, so were able to enjoy our stroll around the harbor. We also appreciated that we were able to keep our vehicle parked at no extra cost for several hours past checkout time."
"7264",5,"Spent a week here for work and the staff was wonderful. Very friendly and helpful. The do a wonderful job and make it very welcoming. I will return when I am back in town again. Location is nice with some good restaurants around."
"7265",4,"Great location. Excellent service. Delicious breakfast. Extremely accomodating for late checkout."
"7266",4,"Great hotel for the dog owners. The staff changed our room from a handicap room to another room based on our requirements and I thank the staff for honoring our request and needs.Thank you very much."
"7267",3,"Manger..Rachel very nice..water pressure in toilet bowl. .u have to wait a long time. .to flush. .bathroom floor dirty. .I clean it! our view looking out bedroom window..was a meter of some kind..breakfast was nice! !.Building needs good panting out side. .It was quite. .Close too the stores nice. ..I would stay again.."
"7268",5,"We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!"
"7269",5,"Excellent service at the Best Western Prarie Inn, Albany, ORegon. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

"7271",5,"We've visited DVR multiple times over the past 8 years, and we've been pleased each and every time. The facility is up-to-date, very clean, and full of things to do.

"7272",4,"This Candlewood Suites near the airport was more than adequate for my overnight needs as I needed quick access to FLL for an early morning flight. The room was quiet, clean, comfortable and reasonably priced. This property does not have a business center, but I was encouraged at the front desk to use the HI Express that was across the... More"
"7273",3,"The hotel is a bit shabby and needs updating. Outdoor pool was decent, but the pool furniture was falling apart, and there was very little of it. On the sides of the pool, was a ton of trash, garbage, debris, and an old mattress propped up behind the dumpster. They really should see these things and clean it up. The room was like a small suite, with a new flat screen. The couch however was filthy. The couches in the rooms that I saw when doors were open, all need cleaned big time. Bed was OK, comfortable enough. I asked for an unstained comforter when I got there extra pillows, and my requests were pleasantly handled right away. I must say, the staff were all very nice. Maids forgot to replenish the coffee in the room, and I had to go for it 3 times. But they were always nice and brought anything we needed. It would never be my first choice in Beaufort, but not my last, either. They just need to pay attention to DEEPER cleaning and updating. Well-intentioned OK for a night or two."
"7274",5,"Bad: Maybe it was just my room but the fridge was kind of hard to reach. Good: I loved the room I was in. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the room was quite cozy. The location was perfect as well. I would definitely stay here again."
"7275",3,"I've stayed in so many Chicago hotels I lost count. This location is excellent. The front desk staff was very helpful and hip. Room very modern, large and included a fridge and pull out comfy chair. Parking was only 36 per 24 hours here. Recalling that you are in a big city here and not some country estate, would night noise from the Loop be a surprise Would a panhandler on the sidewalk be a shock Of course not. If these things are disturbing to you, don't stay here. If you crave peace and quiet, four star ambiance and price, you should go up to the Peninsula. The Italian restaurant in the building is very charming and did I mention the building is an architectural masterpiece by Herbert Hugh Riddle, 1928 Its a gem."
"7276",4,"Bad: No microwave at breakfast."
"7277",3,"A friend and I decided to stay at this hotel and though we chose for the price we were disappointed in the fact there are no fridges to put food in if we went out to dinner. We were also expecting hot water for much longer but we made what we got work."
"7278",5,"We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again."
"7279",3,"The room was very comfortable and clean. The biggest complaint would be that the shower water barely got above luke warm and the walls were terribly thin. There is no DVD player in the room and the breakfast offerings are minimall. Oh, and beware. Parking is expensive. Great location though."
"7280",4,"Spent one night here after travelling from Orlando through the Everglades and the Keys. Excellent first impression, clean, bright lobby, quick check in and a fantastic concierge who provided us with maps and advised on local attractions, etc. The room was a good size with TV, fridge, adequate storage space and complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. I was travelling with a friend and had booked a King room prior to arrival (there had been no other options on the website), however, reception offered us double queen room at no extra cost on check in. Breakfast consisted of hot and cold items sausage patties, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, orange juice, tea/coffee. Good quality and plenty available. Available in the lobby and included in the room rate.The only thing that lets this hotel down slightly is the location. The main Street in Key West is Duval street, which is a good hours walk from the hotel. A taxi costs upwards of 20 dollars. We had a rental car and ended up driving a lot of the street parking is permit only and the car parks are expensive but we managed to park for free on a residential street. Perhaps a shuttle to and from the hotel would be a nice extra touch.A good hotel, would stay again if travelling back to Key West.Thank you for your comments and feedback. So glad you enjoyed your visit to our property and had an excellent first impression. The team does an amazing job maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, and getting our guest checked in quickly so they can enjoy the Island. Thanks for staying with us. Hope to see you back soon."
"7281",5,"Courteous and helpful staff. Very impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel. It was a little pricey, but comparable to most hotels in the area. The gym was very clean and all of the equipment was very well kept."
"7282",5,"The folks at the concierge desk are very helpful in directing you on where to go, what to do, and how to get there. The hotel is within walking distance of Chinatown. The tub in the junior suite is large and oh-so-nice after spending the day shopping or walking the wharf!"
"7283",1,"If you like filth then this is the hotel for you! Bed Linens were not changed for maybe multiple times for one bedroom! Possible Dried Blood and possible Livestock hair on botth pillow cases! Unknown smell greeted us at door upon arrival.. They were also out of towels and had to share a towel among four people! Only thing going... More"
"7284",5,"This hotel was great! Our company held their meetings there we had catered breakfast, lunch, and dinner by the hotel. At night after our meetings it was great to go to the Casino and the tavern was a cool hangout place."
"7285",3,"I recently stayed at the Suncoast for three nights while working on a project in Las Vegas. The good points about this property are that it has plenty of parking (due to the casino), large rooms, great views from the back of the building, and good housekeeping service. The beds were fairly comfortable (but firm) but the pillows were very hard. Walking into the property however, is like a journey back in time. The decor is dated (brass fixtures everywhere) and the casino, registration, and dining areas are like standing in a chimney. There are so many people smoking in the casino, with so little ventilation, that the smell permeates almost the entire property. After a few minutes, my eyes were burning. Fortunately, the smell did not extend to the rooms (but it did to the hallways). Other negative aspects of the property are the very poor selection of TV channels and the poor set ups for working in the rooms. There is wireless internet but there are no power outlets near the desk or bedside tables. It is obvious that this property survives based on its clientele of older casino patrons. I would stay away unless I had a specific reason to be in this area."
"7286",5,"great location in downtown Ithaca. Starbucks conveniently located inside the building. front desk service is exceptional. both ladies working when we checked in were wonderful. rooms are clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend."
"7287",4,"The hotel was undergoing renovations and we did have a problem with the water leaking from the second floor on us as we were on the first floor. The kids loved the pool and the breakfast was very nice. They let you in the breakfast area all day which is very nice for late night snacks for the kids and drinks for the adults. The shuttle to the metro station to catch the subway into DC was very nice and they pick you up as well. I know some folks complain that the last pick up is at 9 pm, but since the DC mall exhibits close at 6 pm it was not a problem. Due to the price of the metro I would recommend the travel time to start on or after 9:30 am"
"7288",4,"A stop for lunch was fine ."
"7289",2,"The room was okay. But bathroom extremely small. Also, it looked like the beginnings of black mold in between the caulking of the shower/bath tub surfaces. Toilet very low to the ground.... The uncomfortable contribution of the bathroom set the precedence for the sentiments felt about the hotel. But, it was a good location and the front desk staff were very helpful in pinpointing attractions and waterfalls in the area. I can't really comment on breakfast since we slept in and missed it daily"
"7290",5,"Bad: Rear and side views from the 4th floor not great. No late night lounge option to have a byob drink with friends and family. Good: Spacious room. Comfortable bed. Friendly staff. Fantastic location."
"7291",4,"was too quick, but very nice area"
"7292",5,"We rented a partial ocean view unit here through VRBO for our honeymoon and loved it. I read a lot of reviews about the amount of children at the resort, and there are a lot of families, however there are a lot of children and families everywhere on Maui so this did not bother us at all. The resort grounds... More"
"7293",5,"This new hotel is immaculate and the staff was wonderful. Ben at the check-in desk was very friendly and accommodating, and went out of his way to make sure our stay was pleasant. Ben answered all of our questions and did it with a smile. He gave us great directions to the church for the wedding we were attending, and... More"
"7294",1,"Do not stay here. Filthy. Sleep in your car if you need an alternative. The board of health should close this hotel down. The manager was rude, the rooms were filthy, smelled like smoke. Would not even sleep under covers."
"7295",3,"Bad: Advertised amenities came up majorly short. Mini bar is locked and does not have any alcohol. Shower appears to have steaming functionality, but didnt work. Breakfast was bread, cereal and hard boiled eggs. Considering you pay 20+ in resort fees, you'd think they'd put a little more effort into the little things. Good: Room was gorgeous, bed was comfortable, shower was nice, starbucks coffee machine is nice."
"7296",4,"Service is great, Charles is awesome, he goes above and beyond to take care of us. Everyone, actually, was very friendly and very helpful. The only two things we didn't like was the room had a horrible view, and the pillows were so soft that they didn't provide any support, and that made sleep not very comfortable."
"7297",5,"Good: loved the room, decor and the plinko wall and their game room area"
"7298",3,"Stayed here for business for one night. Hotel is clean, bed was comfortable and staff was friendly. Hotel was quiet and quick access to the freeway. There are plenty of fast food places to grab a quick bite. I would stay again for work."
"7299",5,"Having a full kitchen is a great feature and breakfast included is a nice way to start the day. Our room was close to the office and that worked out well for us. Our only complaint was that the bathroom door, room 202, did not lock. All staff were very friendly anf helpful. A schedule for the shuttle would have helped and notification that there is a senior rate for the shuttle.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

"7301",4,"Business require that we be in Norfolk early in the morning. Rather than fight the traffic from our home to Norfolk early in the morning we opted to stay in La Quinta. It was only 10 minutes from our appointment. The desk attendent was very helpful with direction. we arrived at our meeting rested and relaxed. If the opportunity arose for us to make an early morning visit again we would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. We were well pleased and could recomend it to anyone."
"7302",5,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights over the 4th of July weekend. We needed a relaxing break from the trauma in our lives since October. Deer Crest really helped us achieve our goal. We had a river front king room which had the most comfortable bed. Room was kept very clean by the very nice housekeeping staff.... More"
"7303",4,"I must say that the hotel met my standards of comfort, space but cleanliness was not so good. The housekeeping staff must be retrained and maybe the hotel should hire dedicated people to clean rooms thoroughly. I found 2 bags of trash in the cabinet from previous tenants (SURPRISED FACE)and the shower curtain was in poor condition. This discovery made me feel that the hotel staff zips in and out rooms, and not cleaning properly."
"7304",5,"Up visiting for my son's graduation from Cornell. The hotel was very clean and the staff was friendly. We took advantage of the free breakfast and were surprised at how much they offered. We had a one bedroom suite which was great for my husband and myself plus our daughter."
"7305",5,"It was leads than 80 for one night. But the room, the service and the breakfast are top quality. We will definitely stay at this hotel next time we go to Chicago."
"7306",3,"Room was too expensive. No full or continental breakfast. Staff a bit laid back. Breakfast was offered on site, but you paid for it. Excellent Restaurants nearby, Denny's and Willie Bird's for dinner. Cost much more for breakfast than normal. Location was OK. just off the freeway (101 North). Shower was very hard to turn on and I had to... More"
"7307",4,"Loved the location. Within walking distance of all we wanted to do."
"7308",4,"Its well worth what you pay. The pool is the hugest I have seen at a hotel! The staff is polite and friendly. Some kinda shortage of housekeepers and waited two hours on checking into a reserved room. Once there it was good we booked a double with a kitchenette. Spacious and convienient. Will be returning."
"7309",4,"Love the value of this hotel as we head to Indy 500 each year."
"7310",2,"It was okay bed bed was soft pillows were hard the toilet seat was small. The interior was 1950s era and in dis repair. Has no services no Wifi or breakfast served. Super 8 in Peru is much better at least they give you something to eat in the morning. If you need a cheap place to stay this place... More"
"7311",5,"This is the hotel if you're just needing a place to stay in Traverse City and do not need lake front property. Rooms were clean and comfortable. WIFI included and a complimentary shuttle which is great if you're trying to get around town to visit the breweries. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and inviting. I will definitely stay here again if I visit Traverse City."
"7312",5,"The hotel was decent and affordable. The info for restaurants in the area was very helpful. We went to a local spot which was more pleasant and less crowded. Very close to the intersate."
"7313",3,"The location is convenient for my friends since they speak limited English, there are lots of Chinese restaurants and stores within walking distance. The hotel service was terrible, we waited at lobby for almost two hours before they can check us in because they were having trouble finding available rooms, we made the reservations weeks ago and I expect the rooms are ready when we arrive."
"7314",5,"This was by far, the nicest property we have stayed at within the Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge area. The scenery is beautiful with the river flowing all around the entire property. The atmosphere and ambiance is excellent. It is definitely within walking distance of all trollies just around the corner. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BEST WESTERN AND WE WILL STAY HERE EVERY... More"
"7315",5,"I spent two days here on a business trip had never stayed in a Drury before. This was a very pleasant surprise. Staff was very friendly and accommodating, helped me out when a scheduling mixup (my fault) could have led to serious difficulties. Breakfast was very good and they even had a 5:00pm snack time with hot food, popcorn, etc.... More"
"7316",4,"New place - my kids loved it - they thought it was very fancy compared to the more mundane places we have stayed. Nice studio - with pretty complete kitchen - pull out bed - had to request the sheets - but it was a good size for the kids. Great gym and a small pool. We missed the happy... More"
"7317",1,"Stay here as your last option! Oldest motel in Ocean Shores. Not cheap either. My junior suite was 140/night. I think It used to be 2 or 3 different motels that they made into 1 resort. I stayed in the 2-story building. I've never stayed here before so I thought I would try it because they accept pets, but I... More"
"7318",3,"Bad: The room we had was situated next to an electrical room, which was noisy and loud throughout the night. We did not have a refrigerator for our drinks, and we asked manager re: both. She said she would take care of the problem. Unfortunately, she did not bring the refrigerator or move us to another room. We should have at least had our room charge reduced, but t no avail. I told the hostess when I gave my keys about the problems, all she said was, I'm sorry.. Good: Location, proximity to US 60 and downtown Williamsburg"
"7319",3,"The main lobby and dining areas were clean. The room was musty and damp. The floor on one side of the bed was damp and sticky. Breakfast was alright - no healthy options, but it was fine."
"7320",5,"Staff accommodated our room request upon arrival. Rooms were extremely clean organized. Kitchenette is a nice touch. Nice pool for the kids, no spa. Breakfast food selection was average, limited space. Great place to stay at a great value!"
"7321",5,"Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines. I'll leave that for the next time............................but will be staying at the Kinzie."

"7323",1,"Should have checked Trip Advisor before staying here. Besides being dirty there were holes in bed linens, paint on floor and door handle, tub wouldn't drain and TV had no signal. The worst motel we have stayed in."
"7324",5,"Very nice hotel casino. Room is spacious and very clean. Bed is very soft and comfy. Location is very accessible to both directions of the strip. Very advance amenities. Good selections of buffet menu."
"7325",4,"My family and I stayed at this hotel last night. Everything was okay except for the swimming pool, it was cold. The breakfast was excellent (having waffles, danish, cereal, sausage, eggs, yogurt, beverages). The interior needs to be remodeled. The attendant was very friendly."
"7326",5,"As it was both of our birthdays and anniversary weekend we asked for an upper floor roorm, quiet, away from the street, in the back. All of our requests were granted. We had a 3rd floor room with a balcony in the back over the pool. Also, the housekeeping staff had made swans out of the towels in shape of a heart which was on our bed. This went way above and beyond. Thank you Melody and All of the BW staff for making our stay memorable. We will definetly be back.Thank you for the High Five! Melody is a great asset to our Hotel and we are glad you enjoyed the swans and your stay. Hope to see you again soon!"

There is a pool on the property that is a good size, and then just behind the hotel is the beach with a life guard stand very close by. Towels... More"
"7329",3,"This hotel seems to be in the midst of a renovation. They said that they put me in one of their newly renovated rooms, so I would hate to see what the rooms looked like before. The textiles are new, but they should have invested in new mattresses and new AC units. The room felt damp and musty and I would have rather slept on the floor than on the deflated, old, lumpy mattress that they have on the bed. The rooms are extremely dark, even with every light on. I cannot believe that this is considered a 3 star hotel for Expedia. Definitely not! It feel like a motel."
"7330",4,"The lower floors of this beautiful office building have been re-purposed as the Aloft Detroit. A wonderful blending of the old and new, this place has a distinctive urban vibe without being overwhelming. Nice 6th floor room overlooking Comerica Baseball Park and Woodward Avenue. Staff were attentive and helpful. The room was contemporary in design and very quiet and spacious.... More"
"7331",5,"Stayed at the Westin for 2 nights. Staff is amazing. Location is amazing! Pebbles at the bar is super helpful and sweet!! Very knowledgeable and friendly! If I'm in the gas lamp area again I will definitely just go in and have a drink if Pebbles is working!!"

"7337",5,"We chose the Grand Hyatt Kauai for the first here nights of our honeymoon in Hawaii. It was amazing - the staff were super helpful, the grounds are amazing and the food was great. In particular, the sushi at Stevensons Library is probably the best we've had (the tempura roll epic). Dinner at Tidepools was pretty good, a bit... More"
"7338",5,"We only stayed one night, but everything was great. Very nice room. I was nursing a leg injury and they were kind enough to accommodate my request for a room with an accessible bathroom."
"7339",5,"My experience was wonderful, will look forward to book it again in the future. The room was just what I was expecting for and the staffs were very friendly and attentively."
"7340",5,"The location of this place was very centrally located to everywhere we wanted to go. We went to Napa to view the wineries and take a bike ride through the vinyards and then to San Francisco and off to Sonoma. Great location.We are so thrilled you had a great time in Napa. Please come see us again."
"7341",5,"It is right under space needle. You can even see Space Needle from the window. After the tour of space needle, kids actually had a nap in the hotel as it is only a few steps away. It is a new Hyatt property with free breakfast."
"7342",3,"The room was clearly not vacuumed and the bathroom floor not cleaned either. Beds were clean and fresh and bathroom counter sparkling. The room's door latch did not fully function when used from the outside and we had real trouble getting into the room every time, to the point of shoulder ramming the door to get in. Luckily, half of... More"

"7359",5,"This was an unexpected surprise! We usually stay on Canal or with friends but this will change that in the future. Loved the hardwood floors and quaint atmosphere. There were no kids running around and it is less than 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street. Continental breakfast, coffee ALL DAY, and really good cafes nearby, open 24 hours or at least late night. Parking lot is secured at night, cameras monitoring as well. Also right across from trolley stop (so convenient-did not have to move the car)!! Wi-fi included"
"7360",4,"Really nice place to stop for the night! Very clean, very friendly staff, rooms are nice size with comfortable beds and updated bathrooms. Breakfast consisted of a waffle maker, cereal, fresh fruit, toast, bagels, hard boiled eggs, all presented very well. Attendants kept everything supplied and tables wiped cleaned. Very nice place!"
"7361",4,"The bathtub had scratches on it that shows black rust. The breakfast ends too early (9:00 a.m.), so if you are coming from a wedding party at 2:30 a.m. you can't sleep enough because you have to rush to have b-fast, and if you have kids you are for sure to miss it! Yet, rooms are spacious, TV is new, internet connection is good, and so is the location. Except from B-fast time and tub condition, I liked it."

"7367",5,"I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. It does show its age, but was a very comfortable stay non the less. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

Pool area seems a little small for the average Vegas Hotel, but also offers a hot tub. Casino a bit smoky, perhaps ventilation system can be turned on higher."
"7373",5,"The desk clerk Jasmine was super nice and the room was comfortable. I would definitely stay there again and while the hotel is a older venue it was clean and offers free shuttle service and continental breakfast which are nice amenities as other venues don't offer these simple accommodations. There is a restaurant on-site which can be accessed within the hotel which is nice as you don't have to go outside (it rained for a couple hours - LOL). I would recommend a modification to the menu to offer more selections. I had the calamari which was okay (I've had better and the potato skins (I've had better) but they both satisfied my hunger so all good on that end. Upon check-out final bill was ready and shuttle was on time. i did forget to tip the driver which I didn't think about initially as i was focused on getting my bags checked in so this CA lady do apologize for that."

They had a contential breakfast at the hotel and that was nice. It had a great selection with staff that worked really hard the entire time to keep everything stocked, cleaned, and looking nice.

I listened to numerous complaints from other guests while I waited in line to complain. The front desk gentleman was indifferent to the complaints and not much was resolved.

Great view from upper floor (we were on floor 34 I think). Bed was quite comfortable. Price was reasonable for a Kansas City hotel in the middle of everything. Fridge in the room which is great. No free WiFi which REALLY chaps me for as much as one pays for hotels now...but overall a nice stay."
"7398",5,"My Son took me here while I was on vacation. We ate on the top deck and had a very good meal. Our hostess was awesome and I will definitely go back. We did walk the streets after dark and it was cool to see all of the architecture downtown."
"7399",5,"We have children and this hotel fit our needs like a glove. The room was decent size with two queen beds on a wed night for 105. The room had a shared balcony overlooking the creek.

"7400",5,"Located right beside Asheville Outlet Mall. A big plus for my wife and daughter. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Always smiled and greeted us when we entered. This will be our first choice for a hotel for all our future visits to Asheville. Five to ten minutes from downtown."
"7401",5,"Good: The staff was very accommodating and the beds were very comfortable."
"7402",5,"The hotel was very clean and the room was comfortable. Off the main drag so there wasn't a lot of traffic noise. The only downfall is that there isn't a continental breakfast. They did have a cupboard where you could purchase food and other items which helped out."
"7403",5,"I was extremely impressed with the room. We booked a two bedroom. Both rooms had king beds. This was not like any other Residence Inn- everything was on one floor and the entrance is not outside- it's very classy. I felt like I was in an extremely expensive hotel. I'm definitely staying here again!"
"7404",3,"I recently stayed here for the first time. I had been to the pool bar in the past but never stayed here.

"7408",4,"Very nice facility. Very good breakfast. Room comfortable. Several non-smoking rooms had stale tobacco smell. The location was a bit distance from Farmington and facilities such as the Pinon Hills Golf course."
"7409",5,"Stayed here for one night passing through. We loved it. Room was nice and comfy! Great river view. Just ask for it. It's located in the heart of downtown so traffic is chaotic. Busy town. Parking is expensive. Self park is 24 in the public parking w/ validation around the corner from the hotel. Valid parking is 43. Everything is in walking distance so park the car and just walk. No point in driving. Ever been to Paris Kind of like that."
"7410",1,"This had to be the nastiest place I've ever seen. Once you get past the tobacco spit on the walls and stairs, the Walmart shopping carts, and the dirty stinky clothes hanging on the hand rails you make it to the room. The room smelled like hundreds of cigarettes had been smoked in it and it had never been aired... More"
"7411",4,"Reasonable rates with free breakfast and right in front of Gaylord National Resort worked for me very well. The rooms have good size bathrooms and the air conditioning in the rooms was excellent. Parking is 11 per day and that is why I did not give it 5 stars. However, at National Harbor 11 is not bad especially when Gaylord charges double of it per day."
"7412",4,"Good: The location was perfect for walking to everything"
"7413",3,"Staff was friendly and efficient especially when transporting to and from the airport. Service was quicker than using the long term parking at the airport.

"7418",2,"Came for a sporting event. Hotel is old and dated but clean. They are in the middle of renovating it."
"7419",4,"Brand new hotel in brand new retail area on the water. Easy to access off the beltway. Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos. The fee for parking in the community garage was free with room key and even included a convenient room key drop upon final exit. Pool but no hot tub."
"7420",5,"This is the 3rd time staying at Best Western in Raton NM. We always rate it a 10!!!! The staff food rooms are always super!! They have a gift shop that offers a wide variety of items to purchase. They offer 2 newspapers. They are very helpful on road conditions."

"7432",5,"Just stayed here for the Who concert and also for the Paul McCartney concert in April 2016. Both at the Key Arena: easy walking distance. Nice thing is that Francisco at the front desk remembered me when I checked in this time! Or better yet, he'd gotten my request for connecting rooms and already blocked them for me! That's pretty good service, I reckon."

"7435",1,"I was please to see how close the hotel was to Kings Dominion (across the street) and a Denny's right next door. The good points ended there, however. Upon entering the room, we noticed lots of white hairs on the floor, so we requested that the floor be vacuumed. I requested a rollaway and we started to set it up after we came back from the amusement park. When I opened it, I found a blood stain on the mattress cover. The front desk was alarmed by the finding, but suggested we cover it with sheets (really). I had them take it away, so my little cousin ended up sleeping in the chair. Much later that night, the toilet was stopped up, but maintenance was to busy to fix it, so a plunger was delivered for us to do it. The toilet kept running the entire night. The following morning the toilet overflowed, so we weren't able to shower and we checked out. Each incident was reported to the front desk and we received a 20 discount, which was unsatisfactory given all of the issues encountered. Hotels.com helped to resolve the issue. Thank you Hotels.com! I would never stay at this location again. I would rather drive a few more miles to get the amusement park, than have the convenience of being close yet sacrifice great service."
"7436",5,"So much to like -- beautiful view, close to everything, bowling pizza for kids right there and I especially love that my dog is welcome! It's not much more expensive than the cheap motels around South Lake Tahoe -- shop for the discounts."

Front Desk and Dining room staffs were very Friendly. We arrived on time to check in so that we have more time to see Seattle. But, our room was not ready. We waited for couple of hours in the lobby before it became available. What Not very impressive!Then the whole night our wifi wasnt working. They said they will reset the router as soon the Technician arrives but it was already too late. We had to check out early for our City Tour and our cruise Housekeeping I think they have to pay more attention in terms of their room services. Towels and toiletries supplies were not enough to accommodate 5 people. We had to request some more supplies. After a couple of hours we waited for the availability of our room We expected way better!"
"7459",2,"This hotel was newly renovated, which made me expect something better. The room smelled awful, and there were dead crickets on our bathroom floor. The decor had in the room had in fact been updated. The bathroom had old tiles old tub old toilet with a new vanity top and mirror. Everything else was obviously old. Our black out curtains were held together with paper clips, we could hear EVERYTHING going on in the room next to us, the hallway, and upstairs! When any doors would shut, our room would loudly vibrate. Our check in clerk was very nice and she tried to help us with anything we needed... Also, no elevator and my parents who are elder, were placed upstairs, making it hard to get them and their luggage to their room! This simply was an emergency place to sleep, but I clearly overpaid, because it was no better than Motel 6 (and it was double the price)"

The only complaint is that the bed needs to be replaced and the sleep sofa was very short even when fully opened. The bed was very soft which caused us to roll toward the middle. The rooom was very clean and nicely appointed with a good sized flat screen TV. The AC worked well. The best part of this hotel is that if you plan to stay more than a few days, the room comes with a small kitchen that has the basics...dishes, pots, pans,etc. and a dishwasher."

The rooms were well insulated from noise. They had a nice happy hour (free drinks for guests from 5-7) and a MADE TO ORDER complimentary breakfast that were both great. I would not recommend the steakhouse located in the building. The food was decent, but overpriced and lacking in quality. The hotel also has a shuttle leaving for the airport every half hour. It made for a really nice stay for two weary travelers."
"7488",4,"The Hotel was beautiful, staff very nice, and clean rooms. However, we got really lost going into the city and the front desk person was not from the area and could not help us at all with directions.

My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. :)We appreciate that you took a moment to share your experience. I'm very excited to hear you were so impressed during your trip to the Big Easy!
